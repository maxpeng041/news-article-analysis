20197,"Hillary Clinton’s Campaign, Cautious but Confident, Begins Considering Running Mates - The New York Times",New York Times,Patrick Healy,M,2016-09-06,2016.0,9.0,,"Hillary Clinton’s advisers and allies have begun extensive discussions about who should be her running mate, seeking to compile a list of 15 to 20 potential picks for her team to start vetting by late spring. Mrs. Clinton’s team will grapple with complicated questions like whether the United States is ready for an   ticket, and whether her choice for vice president would be able to handle working in a White House in which former President Bill Clinton wielded significant influence on policy. While the nomination fight is still fluid, Mrs. Clinton is confident enough of victory that she has described a vision of a running mate and objectives for the search, according to campaign advisers and more than a dozen Democrats close to the campaign or the Clintons. She does not have a   in mind, they said, but she is intrigued by several contenders and scenarios. Among the names under discussion by Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Clinton and campaign advisers: Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, former governors from the key state of Virginia Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who represents both a more liberal wing of the party and a swing state former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, a prominent   Democrat and Thomas E. Perez, President Obama’s labor secretary and a Hispanic civil rights lawyer. But Mrs. Clinton is also open to a woman, campaign advisers said. One obvious possibility is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is hugely popular among progressive Democrats, though she has not been helpful to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, declining to endorse the former secretary of state. Still, Ms. Warren has not been ruled out, according to the campaign advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the confidential search process. Mrs. Clinton has offered general guidance as her team begins the search: She cares less about ideological and personal compatibility than about picking a winner, someone who can dominate the   debate and convince Americans that Mrs. Clinton is their best choice. She also wants a partner who is unquestionably qualified for the presidency and would help create the strongest contrast with the Republican ticket, which could be dogged by questions about Donald J. Trump’s fitness for the presidency or Senator Ted Cruz’s unbending conservatism, according to those interviewed. And she wants someone who could be an effective attack dog against either candidate. Despite the passions stirred during the primary, Mrs. Clinton does not feel pressure to enthrall the supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, since she thinks most of them would ultimately vote for her, an assertion backed up by polling. The most unpredictable issue for the search, at least at this early stage, is the turmoil in the Republican race, which may not yield a nominee until the party’s convention in  . Mrs. Clinton is likely to make her pick soon after the Republican ticket is known, according to Democrats close to the campaign, and her political calculations in choosing a running mate may shift depending on whether the opposing nominee is Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz or someone unexpected, and who the Republican No. 2 is. If Gov. John Kasich of Ohio or Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a   end up on the Republican ticket, Mrs. Clinton might be more inclined to pick Mr. Brown (to help her in Ohio) or Mr. Perez (to help excite Hispanic voters). The vetting of top contenders will be led by James Hamilton, a longtime Washington lawyer who did so for the 2008 Obama campaign and other Democratic nominees, according to the Clinton advisers and other Democrats close to the campaign. The overall search process is expected to be overseen by John Podesta, the campaign chairman. Cheryl Mills, who was Mrs. Clinton’s chief of staff at the State Department and deputy White House counsel for Mr. Clinton, is also likely to play a key role, and Mr. Clinton will have a major voice. Mr. Hamilton, reached by phone, declined to comment and referred questions to Mr. Podesta, who declined an interview request. A campaign spokesman also declined to comment, and Ms. Mills did not respond to an email request for comment. Several Democratic allies say that during the search, the campaign will have to reckon with Mrs. Clinton’s high unfavorability numbers, which may create pressure to choose an inspiring figure like Julián Castro, the federal housing secretary, a rising star in the party. But Mrs. Clinton’s advisers expressed confidence that her favorability ratings would improve once a Republican nominee is chosen. And they and other Democrats say Mrs. Clinton’s options may expand if Mr. Trump is nominated, given his unpopularity with large portions of the electorate. “She will have a lot more flexibility in picking a running mate if the Republican nominee is Donald Trump rather than Ted Cruz, who appears a much closer contest for her,” said former Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana. Most leading presidential campaigns start organizing their   searches at this point in the race, when they have a sizable lead in delegates needed for the nomination. The candidates themselves remain sharply focused on the remaining contests: Mr. Sanders insists he could still overtake Mrs. Clinton, despite her big lead. And she is superstitious about getting too far ahead of herself, as she sometimes did in her failed 2008 race. But given the methodical nature of Mrs. Clinton’s advisers, as well as the political passions of the Clintons themselves, the vice presidency is an increasing preoccupation at campaign headquarters and at the Clintons’ home in Chappaqua, N. Y. “They’re fielding ideas for a running mate, and a lot of people are suggesting names,” said former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a close ally of the Clinton campaign. “I’ve made some recommendations, but all I’ll say is that governing ability and winning the election are the fits that they’re looking for most. ” Former Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, a key ally of the Clintons, said he favored adding a woman to the ticket. “It would be formidable and create huge buzz with female voters,” he said, suggesting Ms. Warren or Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton said she was in the unique position of having firsthand expertise at the vetting and selection process: She was deeply involved in Mr. Clinton’s search in 1992 that resulted in the selection of Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee, with whom she later clashed at times. She supported Mr. Clinton putting another young Southern moderate on the ticket, which was seen as a bold choice at the time  —   and which her advisers point to as evidence that she may be unconventional if she is nominated. Her experience with Mr. Gore colors her perspective in two ways, according to Democrats who have spoken to her about the vice presidency. She knows that if she chooses a younger and ambitious vice president, she will have someone by her side who may be making calculations with an eye toward running for the presidency in 2024. The past two vice presidents, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Dick Cheney, were widely seen as devoted to their jobs they appreciated and sought power, but given their ages, they were not determined to seek their bosses’ job in the future. Mrs. Clinton, 68, likes that fact, Democrats say, and has to decide if she wants a rising star or a seasoned hand who is not interested in the presidency, like Bill Nelson, 73, a senator from another key state, Florida. Mrs. Clinton is also well aware of the inherent tensions between a vice president and a powerful first lady (or first gentleman). She and Mr. Gore became rivals in the White House as she led the health care overhaul effort and he pursued his “reinventing government” initiative, and both wanted their portfolios to be Mr. Clinton’s top priority. Advisers said that in the current search, Mrs. Clinton wants a running mate who would accept and appreciate that Mr. Clinton, as a former president, would offer expertise and guidance  —   and perhaps play a formal role on specific issues  —   if she were president. “Hillary understands how the vice presidency can work well, and not work well, far better than anyone running or anyone on her staff,” said Richard W. Riley, a friend of the Clintons who was the education secretary under Mr. Clinton and advises the campaign on education issues. “And she and Bill Clinton know he’d have to be very careful about how he relates to the vice president. Hillary is the decision maker now. ” Other Democrats argue that the running mate should be   or Hispanic because those two demographic groups have been such strong supporters of Mrs. Clinton  —   and their votes, as well as those from women, are the key blocs she would need in a general election. In addition to Mr. Patrick and Mr. Perez, Democrats close to the campaign said her advisers were also discussing Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is black, and Mr. Castro, who is Hispanic. (Mr. Kaine is also fluent in Spanish.) For all the vetting and strategizing, however,   selections do not always work out as well as intended, especially with so many unconventional variables: the first female nominee the Republican upheaval and the angry, anxious political crosscurrents in the electorate. “It’s so easy to make a mistake in this,” said Robert Shrum, a Democratic strategist on several past campaigns, including John Kerry’s bid in 2004, when John Edwards and Richard A. Gephardt were finalists for vice president. “Choosing Edwards was a mistake because Dick could have helped us in Ohio in a way that Edwards could not, and Dick would have done better in the   debate,” Mr. Shrum said, referring to Mr. Kerry’s narrow loss in that state. “But a lot of us wanted Edwards at the time. Kerry was doubtful about him, but was persuaded,” he added. “The most important thing for Hillary, in the end, is to follow her own instincts on this one. ”"
20225,Donald Trump Sweeps 5 States Hillary Clinton Takes 4 - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin,M,2016-04-27,2016.0,4.0,,"Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton barreled toward a general election showdown on Tuesday night as they dominated primaries in Pennsylvania, Maryland and other Eastern states, piling up enough delegates to close in on their parties’ nominations. Looking past their fading rivals, the two even taunted each other in dueling   events. Mrs. Clinton chided the Republican’s penchant for harsh language by saying that “love trumps hate. ” Mr. Trump was more bluntly dismissive of Mrs. Clinton, saying her appeal boiled down to her gender. “Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she would get 5 percent of the vote,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump had the more convincing performance on Tuesday: He swept all five primaries, winning landslides of more than 30 percentage points over his rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. His routs represented a breakthrough: He received more than half the vote in every state, after months of winning most primaries by only pluralities. The big night for Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton intensified the aura of inevitability around their nomination bids and created urgent new challenges for their rivals. More significant, it increased Mr. Trump’s chances of avoiding a fight on the floor of the Republican convention in July and of claiming the nomination on the delegates’ first ballot. “When the boxer knocks out the other boxer, you don’t have to wait around for a decision,” he said boastfully at an   appearance before supporters at Trump Tower in New York. He added: “As far as I’m concerned, it’s over. ” Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich fared so poorly on Tuesday that together they were likely to win just 10 of the 118 bound delegates up for grabs. Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware also went for Mr. Trump, who was on track to bring his total to about 950 of the 1, 237 needed to clinch the nomination outright. Mr. Cruz is now under growing pressure to beat Mr. Trump in Indiana’s primary next week, perhaps the last real chance the   forces have to halt his march to the nomination. He and Mr. Kasich forged an alliance to thwart Mr. Trump in Indiana, but it has yet to show signs of working. Even before polls closed in the East on Tuesday night, Mr. Cruz tried to   the rush of coverage about Mr. Trump’s dominance. “Tonight this campaign moves back to more favorable terrain,” Mr. Cruz told supporters in the Knightstown, Ind. gymnasium where the high school basketball movie “Hoosiers,” about underdogs who triumph over a   rival, was filmed. On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders won only the primary in Rhode Island and fell further behind Mrs. Clinton in their race to amass 2, 383 Democratic delegates to clinch the nomination. Clinton advisers predicted late Tuesday night that she was poised to net roughly 50 more pledged delegates than Mr. Sanders, out of 462 up for grabs, adding to her lead of about 240 going into the primaries. Clinton advisers said Tuesday’s final delegate tally would reveal not if, but when, Mrs. Clinton would win the nomination: either in early June, if she continues at her current pace, or as soon as the Kentucky and Oregon primaries on May 17, if she does better than expected in the coming weeks, once her support from more than 500 superdelegates is included. Superdelegates could switch their votes at any point, but Mrs. Clinton’s are widely considered to be staunch supporters. Mrs. Clinton predicted that she would return to Philadelphia this summer for the Democratic convention “with the most votes and the most pledged delegates. ” She pledged to heal the party’s wounds after a long nomination fight, telling Sanders supporters that “there is much more that unites us than divides us. ” But she also looked past Mr. Sanders to take a swipe at Mr. Trump and his campaign motto, “Make America Great Again. ” “Despite what other candidates say, we believe in the goodness of our people and the greatness of our nation,” Mrs. Clinton said. Mr. Sanders, speaking Tuesday night to an audience of 6, 500 people in West Virginia, which votes May 10, said emphatically that he would stay in the race. He made an unusually pointed appeal to superdelegates, arguing that he had won more votes from independents and from Republicans than Mrs. Clinton and would be a stronger general election candidate. After the rally, however, Mr. Sanders issued a statement saying he would go to the Democratic convention in July “with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform”  —   a remark that some Democrats interpreted as his first acknowledgment that he would not attend the convention as the nominee. Still, for all his fortitude, Mr. Sanders plans to reassess his candidacy on Wednesday and decide whether to adjust his strategy if Mrs. Clinton’s delegate lead appears all but insurmountable. His senior strategist, Tad Devine, said the Sanders team would discuss a range of issues including how to adjust messaging about the nominating process and what route if any there is to winning it. Mr. Devine said he could still see a mathematical path to securing the nomination but added that, if it changed, the campaign would have to adjust. “If we are sitting here and there’s no sort of mathematical way to do it, we will be up front about that,” Mr. Devine said Tuesday. The broad support for Mr. Trump spanned some of the dividing lines that have characterized the Republican race until now: He won among the affluent and   as well as with   voters and those with no more than a high school education, according to exit polls. But the unease about Mr. Trump’s candidacy in some quarters of the party persisted, a potential warning sign if he emerges as the nominee. About a quarter of Republican primary voters in Connecticut, Maryland and Pennsylvania said they would not support him if he were the party’s nominee. The resistance to Mr. Trump was greatest among Mr. Kasich’s supporters, who are more  : Six in 10 said they would not vote for Mr. Trump in November. Mrs. Clinton was lifted once again by strong backing from blacks and older voters, but she also ran stronger with white voters than she has in many states. In Pennsylvania, she narrowly won among whites. Her performance was even better in Maryland, where she carried white voters by 12 points. Mr. Trump’s advantage across all five states was so forbidding that Mr. Cruz abandoned the Northeast entirely on Saturday, and Mr. Kasich was left to pick up stray delegates. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders campaigned aggressively in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, but they focused largely on policy issues like fracking, gun control and Wall Street reform rather than sniping at each other as they did in a raucous televised debate in Brooklyn. Not only did Mr. Trump have significant prospects for a substantial delegate haul Tuesday, a week after his dominating performance in New York, he also had the opportunity to send a clear message to party leaders and other Republicans that resistance to his nomination is futile. Mr. Trump’s path toward a delegate majority becomes far clearer if Mr. Cruz is unable to defeat him in Indiana. That is why Mr. Cruz left Pennsylvania on Saturday to head to Indiana, and he plans to campaign there as aggressively as he has anywhere since the Iowa caucuses, where he scored a surprise victory. The stakes for Mr. Cruz are so high that within political circles, speculation has been swirling this week that he would try to change the subject from his latest losses and announce his pick for vice president before the primary in Indiana. Advisers to Mr. Cruz were cagey about whether he would take such an extraordinary step in an effort to win Indiana, where polls last week put Mr. Trump ahead. But the advisers did not dismiss the possibility, an indication that they were thinking about such a move, wanted to keep the speculation alive, or both. But Mr. Trump has no intention of giving Mr. Cruz the opening in Indiana he so plainly needs. He planned a rally Wednesday night in Indianapolis with a beloved figure in the state who has also been known to speak his mind and find controversy: Bobby Knight, the former Indiana University men’s basketball coach. The two Democrats have also been eyeing Indiana, with Mrs. Clinton campaigning there on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton narrowly beat Barack Obama in the Indiana primary in 2008, winning support from a sizable majority of white voters  —   who made up nearly 80 percent of the electorate in that primary  —   while Mr. Obama won about 90 percent of the black vote. In the 2016 primaries and caucuses, Mr. Sanders has often beaten Mrs. Clinton among white voters, especially white men, and he also performs well with independents, young people and college students, all of whom were expected to be forces in Indiana. “While our area has lost a lot of   manufacturing jobs, and Senator Sanders has a way of tapping into that, I think Democrats are ready to rally around Mrs. Clinton and help her get ready to take on Trump and the Republicans,” said Dennis Tyler, a Clinton backer who is mayor of Muncie, Ind. in a county Mrs. Clinton carried eight years ago. Sanders advisers have been steadily optimistic about Indiana, but they also acknowledged that a victory there would not matter much if Mr. Sanders fell even further behind Mrs. Clinton in the race for delegates. “If we do,” said Mr. Devine, the senator’s strategist, “we may have to go back to the drawing board. ”"
20280,"Yes, It’s Early, but Donald Trump Would Have Uphill Battle Against Hillary Clinton - The New York Times",New York Times,Nate Cohn,M,2016-05-04,2016.0,5.0,,"A general election matchup between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton became all but certain on Tuesday after Mr. Trump’s decisive victory in Indiana. He would begin that matchup at a significant disadvantage. Yes, it’s still a long way until Election Day. And Mr. Trump has already upended the conventional wisdom many times. But this is when early   polls start to give a rough sense of the November election, and Mr. Trump trails Mrs. Clinton by around 10 percentage points in early general election surveys, both nationally and in key battleground states. He even trails in some polls of several states where Mitt Romney won in 2012, like North Carolina, Arizona, Missouri and Utah. Could Mr. Trump overtake Mrs. Clinton? Sure. Mrs. Clinton is very unpopular herself. Her polling lead is a snapshot in time, before the barrage of attack ads that are sure to come her way. There have been   shifts over the general election season before, even if it’s uncommon. But there isn’t much of a precedent for huge swings in races with candidates as well known as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. A majority of Americans may not like her, but they say they’re scared of him. To have a chance, he’ll need to change that. Mr. Trump’s biggest problem is that he would be the most unpopular major party nominee in the modern era, with nearly   saying they have an unfavorable opinion of him. More than half view him “very unfavorably” or say they’re “scared” of his candidacy  —   figures with no precedent among modern presidential nominees. Mr. Trump’s ratings are worst with the voters who made up the   Obama coalition of young, nonwhite and   voters who propelled President Obama’s   four years ago. In some ways, Mrs. Clinton is not a natural fit to reunite Mr. Obama’s supporters  —   especially the younger voters who have overwhelmingly preferred Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries. But whatever challenges she may have among these groups dissipate against Mr. Trump. Recent surveys even show her leading among   to    voters by a larger margin than Mr. Obama’s when he won them four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s strength among young, nonwhite and   voters would be enough to make her a favorite. The G. O. P. path to victory without adding some of these voters is narrow. The Republicans would need to do nearly as well among white voters as Ronald Reagan did in his     landslide in 1984 merely to fight to a draw in today’s far more diverse country. Nonwhite voters could make up nearly 30 percent of the electorate in 2016, up from 14 percent in 1984. But what raises the possibility of a more decisive defeat for Mr. Trump is that he is struggling to reunite the voters who supported Mr. Romney  —   especially white women and white   voters. A recent   Post poll showed Mr. Trump with just a 29 percent favorability rating among white women and 23 percent among white college graduates, while 68 percent and 74 percent had an unfavorable opinion. Mr. Trump is faring worse than Mr. Romney among white voters in all of the presidential battleground states. Polls even show Mr. Trump losing white voters in states where Mr. Romney won them, like Colorado, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It’s enough to put him at a big disadvantage in early surveys of diverse battleground states like Florida and Virginia  —   as well as North Carolina and Arizona, two states Mr. Romney won in 2012. Mr. Trump has even trailed in a poll in strongly Republican Utah, which is one of the   states in the country. It’s unlikely that Mrs. Clinton could win Utah in the end, but it’s nonetheless telling that Mr. Trump trails in a survey of a state where Democrats have not reached 35 percent of the vote in the last 11 presidential elections. The Trump campaign’s aim to compete in industrial   states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio has not looked promising either. That’s in part because of his broader challenge with   whites (a recent   survey showed Mr. Trump trailing by 29 points in the Philadelphia suburbs) but it’s also because he isn’t connecting among white   Democrats the way the campaign had hoped. The same   survey showed Mrs. Clinton leading in western Pennsylvania, where Mr. Obama lost many registered Democrats to Mr. Romney. Part of the problem for Mr. Trump is that the anger that has driven his success in the Republican primaries isn’t seen at the same levels in the general electorate. A majority of Americans now narrowly approve of Mr. Obama’s performance  —   a big improvement from his standing in surveys ahead of the midterm elections, when his ratings were decidedly negative. An   Post poll found that just 24 percent of Americans were angry at the federal government. There also isn’t much evidence that Americans are particularly dissatisfied with the state of the economy. The unemployment rate is at 5 percent, and gas prices are low. Consumer and economic confidence indicators are well within historical norms. By all of these measures, national political and economic conditions are more favorable to the president’s party than they were at this time in 2012, when Mr. Obama won  . These indicators might make Mrs. Clinton a slight favorite even if she were facing a more typical Republican nominee. Instead, it seems she will be facing a nominee who has both defied expectations and created enormous challenges for himself."
20294,"Your Wednesday Evening Briefing: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Fort McMurray - The New York Times",New York Times,Andrea Kannapell and Sandra Stevenson,F,2016-05-04,2016.0,5.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Donald Trump stands unchallenged for the Republican presidential nomination after John Kasich followed Ted Cruz out of the race. Mr. Trump now faces an electoral map that heavily favors Hillary Clinton. In recent interviews with The New York Times, Mr. Trump sketched out what he meant to be a reassuring vision of his early presidency, including rapid action on a wall with Mexico and halting Muslim immigration. _____ 2. Bernie Sanders holds a lead on Mr. Trump even wider than Hillary Clinton’s, according to a new national poll. Mr. Sanders, who won the Indiana primary on Tuesday but remains far behind in delegates, cites his strong performance against Mr. Trump as a main argument for staying in the race. _____ 3. President Obama made his first visit to Flint, Mich. since the water crisis emerged, promising that he would not rest till the water was safe. He earned applause after asking for a glass of water. “I really did need a glass of water,” he said as he sipped. “This is not a stunt. ” _____ 4. The cause of Prince’s death has not been announced yet, but a clue emerged. His representatives had contacted a specialist in addiction to pain medication, who sent his son on a redeye flight to Minneapolis to offer Prince treatment options. Just off the flight, he was one of the people who found the musician’s body. _____ 5. A towering wildfire raged in western Canada, forcing an entire city of about 80, 000 people to evacuate. The defense minister said the military was ready to assist hundreds of firefighters. The town, Fort McMurray, is the center for the country’s oil sands region. Above, watch scenes from the fire. _____ 6. The Navy SEAL killed in Iraq this week was Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Charles Keating IV, the grandson of a banker jailed in the 1990s in the savings and loan scandal. His death, in a battle with Islamic State fighters, exemplifies the combat dangers facing U. S. soldiers on the “advise and assist” mission  —   as well as the range of Americans trying to halt ISIS. _____ 7. An Army intelligence officer is questioning whether the U. S. fight against the Islamic State is legal. Capt. Nathan Michael Smith sued President Obama, saying Congress must explicitly authorize him to deploy troops. Above, Kurdish fighters hunt for militants in the northern Iraqi town where the decorated SEAL was killed. _____ 8. New York City flashed back to the days of mob wars after a man’s body washed ashore in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. His face had been   his arms were tied behind him and his feet were encased in concrete  —   which takes hours to harden. The case may be the only, um, concrete case of the fabled “cement shoes. ” _____ 9. The future of the Japanese company Takata is in doubt after U. S. regulators said 35 million to 40 million more of its airbags needed to be fixed. That more than doubles the size of what is already the largest automotive recall in U. S. history. U. S. stocks fell after a report said U. S. hiring last month was the slowest in three years. _____ 10. The tech world could lose one of its guiding principles. Moore’s Law  —   the idea that the transistor capacity of a computer chip doubles annually  —   is not expected to apply once scientists manipulate   transistors. So an association of engineers announced it would devise an alternative way to forecast computer technologies. Above, Gordon Moore, the author of the “law. ” _____ 11.

20331,Little Is Off Limits as Donald Trump Plans Attacks on Hillary Clinton’s Character - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy,M,2016-05-17,2016.0,5.0,,"Donald J. Trump plans to throw Bill Clinton’s infidelities in Hillary Clinton’s face on live television during the presidential debates this fall, questioning whether she enabled his behavior and sought to discredit the women involved. Mr. Trump will try to hold her accountable for security lapses at the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and for the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens there. And he intends to portray Mrs. Clinton as fundamentally corrupt, invoking everything from her cattle futures trades in the late 1970s to the federal investigation into her email practices as secretary of state. Drawing on psychological warfare tactics that Mr. Trump used to defeat “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz, “Little Marco” Rubio and “ ” Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries, the Trump campaign is mapping out character attacks on the Clintons to try to increase their negative poll ratings and bait them into making political mistakes, according to interviews with Mr. Trump and his advisers. Another goal is to win over skeptical Republicans, since nothing unites the party quite like castigating the Clintons. Attacking them could also deflect attention from Mr. Trump’s vulnerabilities, such as his treatment of women, some Trump allies say. For Mrs. Clinton, the coming battle is something of a paradox. She has decades of experience and qualifications, but it may not be merit that wins her the presidency  —   it may be how she handles the humiliations inflicted by Mr. Trump. She would make history as the first woman to be a   nominee, yet she would also be viewed, in part, through the prism of her husband’s flaws. Some political allies and friends, while disgusted with Mr. Trump, see a certain cosmic symmetry at work: After decades of fighting what she once called “the politics of personal destruction,” Mrs. Clinton will reach the White House only if she survives one more crucible of sordid and scandalous accusations. “She is so prepared to be president, but holding her head high and staying dignified during the campaign is probably what will help her the most,” said Melanne Verveer, a longtime friend and former chief of staff to Mrs. Clinton. “Trump is yet another way she will be tested personally  —   one of her greatest tests yet. ” Mrs. Clinton has often flourished in the wake of boorish behavior: her husband’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, Kenneth W. Starr’s investigation of her husband, the congressional impeachment proceedings. Women rallied to her side during her 2000 Senate race after her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, invaded her personal space during one debate, and they helped her win the 2008 New Hampshire primary shortly after Barack Obama dismissively said she was “likable enough. ” Yet Mr. Trump said he was determined not to fall into those traps. In a telephone interview, he noted that women did not like seeing Mrs. Clinton insulted or bullied by men. He said he wanted to be more strategic, by calling into question Mrs. Clinton’s judgment in her reaction to Mr. Clinton’s affairs  —   people close to the couple have said she was involved in efforts to discredit the women  —   and in her response to crises like Benghazi. “Just getting nasty with Hillary won’t work,” Mr. Trump said. “You really have to get people to look hard at her character, and to get women to ask themselves if Hillary is truly sincere and authentic. Because she has been really ugly in trying to destroy Bill’s mistresses, and she is pandering to women so obviously when she is only interested in getting power. ” He acknowledged that Republicans tried to discredit her judgment in the marathon Benghazi hearing in the fall, to little avail. But he said that he would be more pointed and memorable in linking her to the failings and deaths in Libya, and that the debate would have a vastly larger television audience than the hearing. Still, advisers of Mrs. Clinton pointed to her   with the   Benghazi committee as a sign of her unflappability. “From Rick Lazio to the House Benghazi committee, there’s a long line of Republicans who set out to personally attack Hillary Clinton but ended up inflicting the damage on themselves,” a Clinton campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, said in a statement. “We know Donald Trump is the most unconventional of them all, but no matter what he throws at her, she will keep running her own campaign and won’t hesitate to call him out. ” Several Clinton advisers said they were not underestimating Mr. Trump’s ability to do some damage, acknowledging that Mrs. Clinton’s unfavorability ratings were high  —   though not as high as Mr. Trump’s  —   and that many Americans had concerns about her honesty and trustworthiness, according to polls. But these Clinton advisers expressed confidence that Mr. Trump would overreach and engender sympathy for Mrs. Clinton. Two advisers said that the campaign had done polling to test the possible effectiveness of Mr. Trump’s lines of attacks and, while not disclosing details about the data, that they were convinced that he would not seriously hurt her. Mrs. Clinton, in turn, has begun attacking Mr. Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns, suggesting he has something to hide, and over his temperament and leadership abilities by describing him as a “loose cannon. ” And political allies say that, in time, voters will see through Mr. Trump’s criticisms. “He can’t run on his   agenda because he doesn’t have one, and he can’t go after her on substantive policy because she knows so much more than he does,” said Thomas R. Nides, Mrs. Clinton’s former deputy secretary of state for management and resources. Yet Mr. Trump has been steadily underestimated during the presidential campaign. His Republican rivals were certain that voters would tire of his slashing style and his harsh language, and some political strategists were sure his lack of policy details would make him unprepared in the eyes of too many. Even one of Mrs. Clinton’s biggest assets to many Democrats  —   becoming the first female president and returning Mr. Clinton to a White House role  —   can be exploited as vulnerabilities. “We’ve never had a woman at the top of the ticket, and there will be plenty of people who’ll have a problem with her gender,” said Christina Greer, a political scientist at Fordham University. And Mr. Trump “can say that Bill Clinton was accused of rape and destroyed a girl’s life,” she added, referring to allegations by Juanita Broaddrick of a sexual assault in the 1970s and to the Lewinsky affair. With polls showing that Mr. Trump has unprecedented high negative ratings with voters and is in particular trouble with women, some Republican strategists say he has no choice but to try to drive up Mrs. Clinton’s unfavorability ratings. A recent   poll found that 57 percent of likely Trump supporters said that their votes were more to express opposition to Mrs. Clinton than to support Mr. Trump. “His best way to rally hostile Republican delegates before the convention is to show he’s a great Clinton attack dog,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who oversaw a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Bush in this year’s Republican race. Mark Penn, the chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, and the Harvard University Center for American Political Studies have conducted polling that indicates that attacks against Mrs. Clinton over her private email server, the deaths in Benghazi and other issues would weaken her in a matchup against Mr. Trump. “The poll shows he could bring her vote down with sharp attacks, but that does not bring his vote up,” Mr. Penn wrote in an email. At a campaign rally for Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday in New Jersey, some supporters said they were concerned about the damage Mr. Trump could do. They described him as a street fighter and worried that Mrs. Clinton would not be gutsy and nimble enough to deliver a knockout punch. “Trump is a real lowbrow brawler,” said Michael Magazzu, an entrepreneur in the energy sector from Vineland, N. J. “That’s not her style. She has to counteract him, and the best way may be to keep her cool. ”"
20340,Hillary Clinton ‘Super PAC’ to Air First Attack Ads Aimed at Donald Trump - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick and Nick Corasaniti,B,2016-05-18,2016.0,5.0,,"The general election effort to take down Donald J. Trump through television ads will begin on Wednesday, with the main “super PAC” supporting Hillary Clinton airing its first two attack ads on broadcast television in four swing states. The effort kicks off a   campaign that will flood screens in those states in the months to come. The super PAC, Priorities USA Action, had initially planned to wait until after the June 7 primary contests to introduce TV ads attacking Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, but accelerated its effort against him. The group’s $6 million investment includes two ads that offer scathing critiques of Mr. Trump’s comments about women that will run for the next three weeks in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada. Mrs. Clinton’s most devoted donors have given roughly $80 million to Priorities USA Action to stop Mr. Trump, more than the group raised in the entire 2012 election to   President Obama. The ads are the beginning of the broader Democratic campaign against Mr. Trump, focused on convincing suburban and   women that he does not respect them. Priorities USA Action said it also planned to run ads that critiqued Mr. Trump’s business record and portrayed him as out of touch with the   Americans he says he represents, an approach similar to the one it used to depict the Republican nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, as a cold corporate titan. Mrs. Clinton’s allies said Mr. Trump’s mocking of a New York Times reporter’s disability also effectively turned off swing voters, potentially providing fodder for future ads that depict Mr. Trump as insensitive and unprepared for the presidency. Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals criticized Mr. Trump similarly on his comments about women and on his business record during the party’s nominating contest, but the effort came too late to stop his momentum. One of the super PAC’s ads, called “Speak,” shows voters   some of Mr. Trump’s caustic remarks about women as they wear shirts with Mr. Trump’s visage   on them. The other, “Respect,” shows quick interviews with the candidate in which he outlines his positions on abortion and Planned Parenthood. The super PAC had initially invested $130 million to reserve time for broadcast and digital ads that would start running the day after the California and New Jersey primaries in June. But it decided to add an additional buy to accelerate the time line, aiming to sow early doubts about Mr. Trump, particularly among female voters who will have a disproportionate effect on the fall election and with whom Mr. Trump has shown a particular weakness in polls. Female voters favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump, 55 percent to 35 percent, in a New York   News poll released in March, twice the gender gap of the 2012 presidential election, when President Obama defeated Mr. Romney. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, which cannot directly coordinate with the super PAC, has tried to raise money by showing Mr. Trump’s comments assailing the former secretary of state for playing the “woman’s card. ” Mrs. Clinton, though, has tried to avoid directly provoking Mr. Trump, relying instead on outside groups like the super PAC to carry out direct attacks. The campaign’s online videos against Mr. Trump have focused mostly on his policy positions and on criticism by his rivals in the Republican primaries. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the “Speak” ad had misrepresented one of his statements. “The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. ‘You can tell them to go BLANK themselves’  —   was about China, NOT WOMEN!” he wrote on Twitter. That drew a rebuke from the super PAC. “Sorry Donald, but the ad isn’t only about your overt sexism, it’s about your divisiveness and character being unsuitable for the office of the presidency,” Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the group, said in an email on Tuesday morning. In an interview, Mr. Barasky said the group thought it had to advertise earlier after seeing the Republican “stop Trump” effort fall short. “The decision was made recently to go up now because we learned from Washington Republicans that you can’t wait to go after Trump,” Mr. Barasky said. “What they did was too little, too late, and we weren’t going to make the same mistake. ” The new ads adhere to similar lines of attack taken by Our Principles PAC, the super PAC led by Republican operatives. It released an ad, “Quotes,” featuring female actors reciting Mr. Trump’s quotations about women. The ad tested highly in effectiveness, but came out only days before the Republican primary in Florida, which Mr. Trump won. “Speak” is slightly different in that the ad uses Mr. Trump’s voice rather than those of actors, along with the voices of voters. “Our research shows most people know very little about Donald Trump,” Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Priorities PAC, said on MSNBC on Monday night, adding, “When we tested a lot of the ‘Never Trump’ ads, we realized very quickly they really had no idea what Donald Trump had been saying on the stump and what his record had been in business or toward women, and so it’s our job to make sure they see it. ” He added that the group would also be focused on Mr. Trump’s business record, an issue that numerous Republican groups and campaigns highlighted during the nominating contest. Mr. Cecil specifically mentioned Mr. Trump’s record of “making ties in China and hiring people in Bangladesh. ”"
20363,Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Set for Clash on Gun Control - The New York Times,New York Times,Trip Gabriel,M,2016-05-23,2016.0,5.0,,"If more people were armed, Donald J. Trump says at rallies, mass shootings like those in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. would be less deadly. If you have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, he wants to make it valid in all 50 states, as simple as a driver’s license. And Mr. Trump himself has a permit to carry a concealed handgun, which he is not shy about mentioning. “Somebody attacks me, oh, they’re gonna be shocked,” he warned last year. Mr. Trump, who promises to “totally protect” the Second Amendment, is scheduled to speak on Friday at the annual convention of the National Rifle Association, on the cusp of a general election in which gun issues are expected to be more prominent than in recent presidential races. His address should signal how far he is likely to go in pressing gun rights to energize the Republican base in the fall campaign. Whereas President Obama   gun control in both his national runs, Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, is signaling a greater appetite to clash with Mr. Trump on the issue. In a Twitter message last week, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, would force schools “to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office. ” “This issue is at a tipping point,” said Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, citing Mrs. Clinton’s politically effective framing of gun issues that put Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the defensive in the Democratic primary campaign. “You’re going to hear about it as differentiator for the first time in decades” in the general election, Mr. Gross said. Mrs. Clinton’s appearances in black churches, where she cited the grim statistics of gun violence and surrounded herself with families of victims, helped her win crucial   voters. She relentlessly criticized Mr. Sanders for his votes against gun control in the Senate. On the other hand, Mrs. Clinton avoided speaking about gun control in rural white regions of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, whose   voters will be desperately fought for by any Democratic nominee against Mr. Trump. A disparaging comment by Mr. Obama in 2008, who said that these voters cling to guns and religion, did much damage. As Mrs. Clinton turns to the general election, she plans to highlight the issue in swing districts like Northern Virginia and the Philadelphia suburbs, a campaign official said, where changing demographics are tipping support for gun control, especially among women. Mr. Trump’s naming of 11 potential Supreme Court justices on Wednesday seemed no coincidence: On the eve of the N. R. A. ’s meeting, the group’s concern for the court’s conservative tilt is likely to outweigh any hesitations about Mr. Trump’s reversal from earlier liberal positions on gun control. A statement on gun rights was one of the first detailed policy papers Mr. Trump issued last year after announcing his candidacy. He accused Mrs. Clinton this month of seeking to “abolish the Second Amendment. ” And just as he argues that casualties from the terrorist attacks in Paris last year would have been lower if civilians had been armed, he has proposed abolishing   zones at military bases and at schools. “I will get rid of   zones on schools, and  —   you have to  —   and on military bases,” Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail in January. “My first day, it gets signed, O. K.? My first day. There’s no more   zones. ” A federal law from the 1990s established   school zones. It could not be reversed by executive order, as Mr. Trump seems to imply. (His campaign did not respond to a request for comment about his gun policies.) “Trump would not be able to eliminate   zones by executive order,” said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an expert on the Second Amendment. “That law can only be repealed by Congress. ” Mr. Trump opposes almost all recent actions aimed at reducing gun violence proposed by Mr. Obama and Democrats in Congress, who have sought gun regulations after horrific shootings in recent years. Each has failed in the face of Republican opposition. The measures included expanding background checks to people buying firearms at gun shows and online limiting the capacity of magazines and banning assault weapons. “Gun and magazine bans are a total failure,” Mr. Trump wrote in his position paper. “The government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own. ” Those positions represent a reversal from where he stood about 15 years ago when he first contemplated a run for president. In a 2000 book, Mr. Trump supported a ban on assault weapons and a “slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. ” He also criticized the power of the gun lobby. “The Republicans walk the N. R. A. line and refuse even limited restrictions,” he wrote. Bob Barr, an N. R. A. board member, said that despite Mr. Trump’s inconsistencies, he was preferable to Mrs. Clinton, who has said that a 2008 Supreme Court ruling overturning a handgun ban in Washington was wrongly decided. “We’re all very familiar with the fact Mr. Trump does change his positions over time, sometimes over a very short period of time,” said Mr. Barr, a former Georgia congressman. “The most important question in my mind is would he be better than Hillary Clinton, and the answer is absolutely yes. ” In polls, a majority of voters align with Democrats’ positions on gun control, though political strategists often say that only opponents care passionately enough about the issue to guide their vote. A New York   News poll in January found that 57 percent of respondents wanted stricter laws governing gun sales, and 88 percent favored background checks for all purchases. Mr. Trump goes against that grain. “What we don’t need to do is expand a broken system,” he wrote in his policy paper. One area in which Mr. Trump does part ways with gun rights activists is on preventing people on the government’s terrorist watch list from buying weapons. “If somebody is on a watch list and an enemy of state and we know it’s an enemy of state, I would keep them away, absolutely,” he said in an interview with ABC News last year. Senate Democrats pushed for such a bill, which many of Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals opposed. As a lifelong resident of New York City, which has some of the strictest gun laws on the books, Mr. Trump is an unlikely supporter of gun rights in a party that usually aligns with the cause because of libertarianism or roots in rural hunting. In addition to Mr. Trump’s permit to carry a handgun, his two sons are hunters. Photographs of the two men from a   hunting trip in Africa resurfaced last year, stirring criticism from animal rights activists for their poses with exotic animal conquests, including an elephant, a crocodile and a leopard. At the N. R. A. convention a year ago, Mr. Trump brought out his sons, Eric and Donald Jr. “These are our people,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “These are things we do on the weekends, in our free time. ”"
20390,Hillary Clinton Warns Against Treating Donald Trump as ‘Normal’ Candidate - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-05-23,2016.0,5.0,,"Continuing to treat a victory over Senator Bernie Sanders as a fait accompli, Hillary Clinton on Sunday questioned Donald J. Trump’s business record and assailed his ideas, warning that the coming weeks represented a critical period in which, if left unchallenged, Mr. Trump could “normalize himself” as he seeks to broaden his support. But Mr. Sanders pointed to polls showing Mrs. Clinton with dangerously high percentages of people who have unfavorable views of her and asked whether a choice between her and Mr. Trump in the fall would force voters to pick the “lesser of two evils. ” Even as she contends with Mr. Sanders’s unflagging critique from the left, Mrs. Clinton said it was vital for her to pivot to confront Mr. Trump now, lest he successfully repackage himself for wider consumption, rather than appealing to the Republican primary electorate alone. “I do not want Americans and, you know,   Republicans, as well as Democrats and independents, to start to believe that this is a normal candidacy,” Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Trump’s campaign on NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” “I know he has a plurality of Republicans who have voted for him,” she added. “But I think in the course of this campaign, we are going to demonstrate he has no ideas. There’s no evidence he has any ideas about making America great, as he advertises. He seems to be particularly focused on making himself appear great. And as we go through this campaign, we’re going to be demonstrating the hollowness of his rhetoric. ” Mrs. Clinton also poked at Mr. Trump’s failure to release his tax returns. Told that Mark Cuban, the media executive and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, had expressed interest in being her running mate, Mrs. Clinton said she was “absolutely” open to considering business leaders, not just elected officials. “Businesspeople, especially successful businesspeople, who are really successful  —   as opposed to pretend successful  —   I think, have a lot to offer,” said Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign has begun taunting Mr. Trump with a #PoorDonald hashtag on Twitter, suggesting that he is not nearly as wealthy as he claims. Mr. Trump has cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as his reason for keeping his tax returns private. “We’ve got to get below the hype,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I think we’re beginning to find out, but I don’t think we know enough, and that’s why he should release his tax returns. ” In choosing a running mate, Mrs. Clinton said she would seek, above all, someone prepared to be president and “someone you can work with  —   someone you believe will be a good partner. ” Mrs. Clinton’s intense focus on Mr. Trump came as a new ABC   Post poll showed the two    among registered voters in a general election matchup, after Mrs. Clinton had led by nine percentage points in March. Voters have widely unfavorable opinions of both candidates: 53 percent expressed such a view about Mrs. Clinton and 60 percent about Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders, however, vowed on Sunday to fight all the way to the Democratic convention in July, pointing to polls that indicated he would fare better against Mr. Trump than Mrs. Clinton would. In several television interviews, he complained that Democratic superdelegates had thrown their support to Mrs. Clinton before he had even entered the race. “I ask those superdelegates to take a look at which candidate is the stronger to defeat Donald Trump,” Mr. Sanders said on ABC’s “This Week. ” “I don’t want to see the American people voting for the lesser of two evils. ” When the host George Stephanopoulos followed up by asking if he saw Mrs. Clinton as “the lesser of two evils,” Mr. Sanders backed away slightly. “Well, if you look at  —   no, I wouldn’t describe it, but that’s what the American people are saying,” he said, citing her unfavorable ratings. Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton will be campaigning hard in California, which holds its primary on June 7. In Vista, Calif. on Sunday, Mr. Sanders told a cheering crowd that he was the strongest Democratic candidate to defeat Mr. Trump and that he hoped to have 50 percent of the total pledged delegates by the end of voting. He also stressed that his campaign had more “enthusiasm” and “energy” than his rival’s. “Our vision of social justice, of economic justice, of racial justice and of environmental justice  —   our vision is the future of this country,” Mr. Sanders said. “And I hope the leadership of the Democratic Party understands it must be the vision of the Democratic Party. ” Mrs. Clinton drew criticism from some Democrats and Republicans recently after telling voters she would put her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “in charge of revitalizing the economy” and job creation. On Sunday, she clarified her intentions, saying his role would be advisory, not ministerial. “I am going to ask my husband, who has a great track record in creating jobs, putting people back to work, revitalizing communities, to be in an advisory role working with me, working with our cabinet, to try to figure out what we can do” in particularly   areas, Mrs. Clinton said on NBC. “You know, every first lady has taken on special projects. ”"
20399,Libertarians See Chance Amid Discontent Over Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton - The New York Times,New York Times,Alan Rappeport,M,2016-06-20,2016.0,6.0,,"ORLANDO, Fla.  —   Delegates puffed on   between chants of “freedom!” Educational booths proclaimed the virtues of hemp, “  economics” and the literature of Ayn Rand. A woman on stilts wearing purple angel wings greeted activists as they milled between seminars on drug war policies and on “how to abolish the government in three steps. ” In a year when the two major parties are consumed by tensions, defections and chaos, the Libertarian Party, which sees itself as their alternative, displayed some of the same traits as it wrestled with nominating two former Republican governors for its presidential ticket at its annual convention over the weekend. But there was also a palpable sense of excitement at the event, held at a hotel here less than 10 miles from Disney World. For an antiwar party that promotes legalizing marijuana and tearing up the tax code, 2016 has brought hope that acceptance in the political mainstream is imminent amid broad discontent with the probable nominees from the major parties. “We have been given the gift of Trump and Clinton,” said Larry Sharpe, a businessman and candidate for the Libertarian   nomination. “Their ears are open, and I want them to hear who we are and vote for us for who we are. ” The Libertarian Party is the country’s third largest by voter registration, excluding people who consider themselves independent, but it is often overlooked as a political sideshow with a hodgepodge of positions that many consider to be either overly liberal on social issues or too conservative fiscally. With Donald J. Trump’s rise spawning a contingent of conservative Republicans who will not support him and backers of Senator Bernie Sanders feeling that the Democratic Party is favoring his opponent, Hillary Clinton, Libertarians think they are poised to peel away voters from both sides. The party aims to be on the general election ballot in all 50 states. “There are Republican voters who are going to feel cheated by the fact that their presidential nomination has been taken by a reality show star, and there are Democratic voters who are going to feel cheated when that corporate shill boxes out Senator Sanders at the convention in that rigged process,” Nicholas Sarwark, the Libertarian Party’s national chairman, said on Sunday. “When those people feel cheated, we present an option for them. ” Although only the most fanatical party loyalists feel confident about their chances of winning the presidency, many think that Libertarians are poised to win a record number of votes. Some believe they could steal a state, which no third party has done since George Wallace in 1968, or get enough votes to influence the election, as Ross Perot and Ralph Nader did. More than disrupting the election, though, they see it as a golden opportunity for true national exposure and expansion. The party received more than a million votes in 2012, its most ever, and recent polling suggests a growing appetite for   candidates. An NBC   Street Journal poll this month found that 47 percent of registered voters would consider a   candidate if Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were the major party nominees. Political analysts were taken by surprise this spring when two separate polls showed Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor and the 2012 Libertarian Party nominee, pulling 10 percent and 11 percent of the national vote. The party chose Mr. Johnson again as its   at its nominating convention on Sunday. If he can get to 15 percent in polls, he can stand on the debate stage as the first   candidate to do so since Mr. Perot in 1992. The feat would provide a bounty of free news media attention for a party that does not have the money for expensive advertising or   efforts. Mr. Johnson believes that with sufficient exposure and a positive message he can attract both the young, progressive voters who are backing Mr. Sanders and Republicans who want limited government but fear that Mr. Trump would ratchet up spending and start trade wars. “We should be portraying an optimistic message,” Mr. Johnson, dressed in a dark suit with no tie and wearing sneakers, said in an interview. “Life is good in America. ” Looking to add credibility to his campaign, Mr. Johnson is teaming up with William Weld, the former Massachusetts governor, as his running mate. Mr. Weld, who has compared Mr. Trump’s immigration policies to those of Nazi Germany, said he was reaching out to Republican donors who have decided that they cannot support their party’s presumptive nominee. “I’m going to go knocking on every door I can to try to help us along,” Mr. Weld said. As with Republicans and Democrats, the Libertarians displayed their own intraparty divides on Sunday during a raucous round of voting. Many delegates expressed concern that the party was becoming a landing ground for failed former Republicans and sacrificing its purity to appear more palatable. Mr. Johnson secured the nomination on the second ballot of voting, and Mr. Weld was forced to publicly promise his allegiance to the party before he was voted onto the ticket, also on a second ballot. The possible effect of the Libertarians on the November election remains unclear, as most state polls have not included any of the candidates and the party is not yet on the ballot in every state. Kyle Kondik of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia said a ticket with Mr. Johnson and Mr. Weld could capture many votes in their home states of New Mexico and Massachusetts. Alaska, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada have also shown a propensity to find unconventional candidates appealing, he said, so the Libertarians could tilt close races there. “The Libertarian ticket is kind of a mix of left and right,” Mr. Kondik said. “There is potential appeal for it to be a soft landing spot for voters of all stripes. ” Still, the climb will be steep. There were just 411, 000 registered Libertarian voters as of February, and, Mr. Kondik noted,   candidates tend to underperform their poll numbers. “Ultimately it would be a giant shock if they carried even one state,” Mr. Kondik said. “Perot never did, and he got 19 percent. ” Despite efforts to broaden their base and become an acceptable alternative to the American public, Libertarians battle perceptions that they are “Republican lite” or “old white guys. ” The convention’s   atmosphere belied those caricatures: A   clad in a   leotard strode across the stage with an umbrella to introduce one candidate, and professional dancers basked in strobe lights at a party before the candidates debated on Saturday night. The debate itself offered a window into some of the challenges the Libertarians face as they try to package themselves for broader consumption while sticking to their   principles. The conversation often drifted into strained arguments about how common sense would keep heroin out of the hands of children, how   driver’s licenses are unnecessary  —   one suggestion was a pink flashing light for new drivers  —   and how public infrastructure could be built without taxes. “Who will build the roads?” Austin Petersen, a presidential candidate and founder of The Libertarian Republic, a magazine, said during the debate. “Where we’re going we don’t need roads. ” There were also   presidential hopefuls such as Vermin Supreme, a performance artist who wandered the event with a rubber boot on his head, and Marc Allan Feldman, who began his speech with a Libertarian rap in which he proclaimed, “Republicans and Democrats are wack. ” And then there was John McAfee, the antivirus software pioneer who in 2012 was in hiding in Belize after the police there sought him for questioning in the death of his neighbor. Mr. McAfee, who presented a campaign video declaring, “Here’s to the crazy ones,” doused some of the enthusiasm when he said none of the candidates  —   himself included  —   had any chance of becoming president. Win or lose, most remained encouraged that this year will be important for the Libertarian Party and that even if they do not take the White House this time there are opportunities to win state and local races and to convert Republicans and Democrats. Scott Scrimshaw, a community chaplain from Oregon, switched from Republican to Libertarian six months ago after he surveyed the field of candidates and found himself disappointed. A longtime admirer of Ronald Reagan, he said that he could not trust Mr. Trump with his vote and that he did not want to choose between “the lesser of two evils. ” “I feel we are really on the edge of entering a new era of American politics,” Mr. Scrimshaw said. “The era of the third party. ”"
20418,Gov. Jerry Brown Endorses Hillary Clinton Ahead of California Primary - The New York Times,New York Times,Adam Nagourney,M,2016-06-01,2016.0,6.0,,"LOS ANGELES  —   Gov. Jerry Brown of California has run three times for president. He is serving his fourth term as governor and stands as one of the most popular elected officials in the state. He has also kept a noticeably low profile as the Democratic presidential primary contest has moved to California, reflecting what aides described as the interest he had in both candidates. But that ended on Tuesday as the Democratic governor came off the sideline and endorsed Hillary Clinton as someone who has the “tenacity and skill to advance the Democratic agenda” and defeat the presumptive Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. “Democrats have shown  —   by millions of votes  —   that they want her as their nominee,” he said in an open letter to Democrats and to independents, who are permitted to vote in the Democratic primary on June 7. Mr. Brown’s decision is the latest sign that California is shaping up as a climactic end to the Democratic nominating session. Mrs. Clinton and her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have turned their attention to a state where Mrs. Clinton had once been confident of victory, and where one poll last week showed the two candidates essentially tied. On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders continued plowing through a heavy schedule of rallies in California, many in parts of the state where national candidates do not often go. Mrs. Clinton has scaled back plans to campaign in New Jersey to add additional events in the state, with a focus on Southern California, where she will be counting on minority voters to propel her. Nonetheless, she told MSNBC on Tuesday that she was “feeling very positive” about California. “We are competing everywhere, but I have been struck by some of the challenges California faces,” Mrs. Clinton said, criticizing Mr. Trump for denying the state’s drought. Mr. Sanders is spending about $1. 8 million on advertising in California, and Mrs. Clinton about $1 million, according to Kantar  . That is not a lot of money in a state like California, where a robust media campaign can easily cost $5 million to $10 million a week. Both candidates are concentrating their advertising campaigns, focusing on places like Fresno, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Mr. Sanders, after giving a speech on health care in Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, told reporters Tuesday that he was not surprised by Mr. Brown’s decision, noting that governors and other elected Democrats had repeatedly endorsed Mrs. Clinton, a former senator from New York and secretary of state. “I like Jerry Brown, but people can make their own choices,” Mr. Sanders said. “What we have had to do, and we have done pretty well in every state in this country, is taken on Democratic governors, taken on Democratic senators, taken on Democratic members of the House, Democratic mayors and all of their political apparatus. And yet we have won in 20 states, and I think we are going to win here in California. ” Mr. Brown, in his letter, offered strong praise for Mr. Sanders, noting the similarities between the Sanders campaign and the one Mr. Brown waged when he ran for president in 1992. “He has driven home the message that the top 1 percent has unfairly captured way too much of America’s wealth, leaving the majority of people far behind,” he wrote. “In 1992, I attempted a similar campaign. ” Still, the governor, who lost to Bill Clinton in a contest that left lingering bitterness between the two men, offered a powerful case against Mr. Trump in arguing that Mrs. Clinton had proved not only that she had abundant support among Democrats, but the ability to win in November. Mr. Brown met privately with Mrs. Clinton in San Francisco and Mr. Clinton in Sacramento last week. Mr. Trump, Mr. Brown noted in his letter, “has called climate change a ‘hoax’ and said he will tear up the Paris Climate Agreement. ” “He has promised to deport millions of immigrants and ominously suggested that other countries may need the nuclear bomb. He has also pledged to pack the Supreme Court with only those who please the extreme right,” Mr. Brown wrote. “The stakes couldn’t be higher,” he added. Even if she loses here, Mrs. Clinton will almost certainly have enough delegates to win the nomination. But a loss in the largest state  —   and in a Democratic stronghold  —   would not only provide a dark end to what has been at times an unhappy campaign, but might also empower Mr. Sanders to stay in the race, further delaying the point when Mrs. Clinton can turn her full attention to Mr. Trump. To win the nomination, Mr. Sanders would have to persuade hundreds of   superdelegates  —   party officials and leaders like Mr. Brown  —   to switch their allegiance in time for the July convention. Winning California, his aides say, can help him make that case. Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the senator would campaign heavily through Primary Day, going to parts of the state where he knows he can draw huge crowds and television coverage. “We think we have a very narrow path to get there,” Mr. Devine said of winning the nomination, “and California is the most important piece of that puzzle. ” A poll last week showed the two candidates essentially tied in the state. But many analysts say this is a difficult contest to poll, because there has been a huge   surge in registration and because it is challenging to project how many independents, who have favored Mr. Sanders, will actually participate."
20422,Hillary Clinton Aide Says Little Thought Was Given to Potential Issues Over Private Email - The New York Times,New York Times,Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers,M,2016-07-28,2016.0,7.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Hillary Clinton’s chief of staff at the State Department said in sworn testimony released Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton’s advisers gave little thought to the problems her private email server might create if they were forced to turn over her communications under public records law. “Certainly from my standpoint, I wish that had been something we thought about,” Cheryl D. Mills, who was chief of staff when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, testified in a deposition on Friday in a lawsuit against the State Department brought by a conservative legal group. Ms. Mills’s comments  —   contrite at times, defensive at others  —   represented the first sworn public accounting from a member of Mrs. Clinton’s inner circle about the controversy over her exclusive use of a private email account during her State Department tenure. The issue, which has dogged her presidential campaign for more than a year, flared up again last week after the release of a highly critical investigation by the State Department’s inspector general that found Mrs. Clinton was not authorized to use the private server. Mrs. Clinton declined to be interviewed for that inquiry. Ms. Mills insisted during nearly seven hours of testimony that Mrs. Clinton’s use of the private clintonemail. com account, housed on a server in her home, was “absolutely not” an attempt to evade the Freedom of Information Act, as many of her critics have charged. She acknowledged, however, that the account was tightly held. Unless Mrs. Clinton emailed other officials first from her account, they had to go through gatekeepers in Mrs. Clinton’s office to get her email address. Even top officials like Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff in 2009 and 2010, had to request the address. But Ms. Mills also said that the private account was no secret. She estimated that Mrs. Clinton shared emails with about 100 State Department officials from her private account. “So her use of her email was not something that was unknown,” she said. Her deposition came in a private lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal advocacy group. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, has allowed the group to take sworn testimony from at least a   officials to explore how and why the private email server was used  —   a decision that the judge has said “boggles the mind. ” Ms. Mills’s lawyer, Beth A. Wilkinson, repeatedly clashed with the Judicial Watch lawyers, saying their questions were beyond the scope of what the judge had allowed. But Ms. Mills, who like Mrs. Clinton refused to be interviewed by the State Department’s inspector general, voiced no apparent irritation over her lengthy deposition and told lawyers for Judicial Watch that she wanted to be helpful, according to a transcript. Under questioning, Ms. Mills detailed how Mrs. Clinton came to use the private server, and what her aides did to facilitate the unusual arrangement. She said that Mrs. Clinton never considered using an official government email address and made clear from the start of her tenure in 2009 that she wanted to use a personal email address, Ms. Mills said. She described that decision as “a continuation of a practice that she had been using as a senator” before becoming secretary of state. Ms. Mills said repeatedly that she could not recall any specific discussions in Mrs. Clinton’s office about how to preserve her emails to ensure that they would be available when the State Department responded to requests under the Freedom of Information Act, the law passed after Watergate to encourage government transparency. She said she assumed that the emails Mrs. Clinton sent to officials with department email accounts would be “captured” automatically and saved. At the same time, she acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton periodically emailed officials at their personal accounts  —   records that would not have shown up in the State Department system. Ms. Mills testified that she routinely complied with records requests under the law, known as FOIA, but that a separate office dealt with the requests. She said she did not recall any instances in which she discussed the requirements regarding those requests, even when shown an email from Stephen D. Mull, who was executive secretary in Mrs. Clinton’s office from 2009 to 2012, about the issuance of a State Department BlackBerry. “We will prepare two version for her to use, one with operating State Department email account which would mask her identity but which would also be subject to FOIA requests,” wrote Mr. Mull, who is also scheduled to testify in the Judicial Watch lawsuit. The State Department’s inspector general documented one episode in 2010 in which a top information management official, John Bentel, told two unnamed specialists in his office “never to speak of the secretary’s personal email system again” after they had raised concerns about the private email arrangement. Asked whether anyone had raised concerns that Mrs. Clinton’s emails would not show up in public records requests, Ms. Mills said: “I’m not aware of it. They might have. ” She said repeatedly that she wished she and other advisers had given more thought to the issue."
20428,Hillary Clinton to Portray Donald Trump’s Foreign Policy Positions as Dangerous - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-06-02,2016.0,6.0,,"Hillary Clinton plans to deliver a scorching assessment of Donald J. Trump’s foreign policy prescriptions on Thursday, casting her likely Republican rival as a threat to decades of bipartisan tenets of American diplomacy and declaring him unfit for the presidency. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides said the speech, which she will deliver in San Diego, would be the start of a persistent assault to portray a potential Trump presidency as a dangerous proposition that would weaken American alliances and embolden enemies. The argument will include specific criticism of comments Mr. Trump has made about rethinking the United States’s support of NATO his proposal to allow Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to acquire nuclear weapons his vow to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States and his pledge to advance the use of torture and kill the families of suspected terrorists. But Mrs. Clinton will also invoke her experiences as secretary of state, including in 2011 when she supported President Obama’s decision to send Navy SEALs on a raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, to make the case that Mr. Trump does not have the temperament to make such decisions. “Donald Trump is unlike any presidential candidate we’ve seen, maybe ever, certainly in decades, in that he does not cross the threshold of fitness for the job,” said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton’s top policy adviser, who helped draft the speech. Mrs. Clinton will deliver the address on her final campaign swing before California holds its Democratic primary on Tuesday, when she is widely expected to reach the threshold of delegates needed to secure her party’s nomination. But in choosing to raise concerns about Mr. Trump’s foreign policy stances, she will be speaking to swing voters in general election battleground states who have doubts about a Trump presidency. While Mrs. Clinton must be cautious not to alienate liberal Democrats who oppose some of her hawkish foreign policy stances, her campaign says national security could be the catalyst that drives independents and wavering Republicans to support her this fall. Roughly 21 percent of independent voters and 32 percent of Republican voters said the most important issue this election was terrorism and national security, compared with 16 percent of Democrats, according to a Suffolk   Today poll conducted last month. At the same time, 61 percent of registered voters said a Trump presidency would make America’s image in the world worse, according to the latest New York   News poll. “There are many Republicans concerned about this,” R. Nicholas Burns, an American ambassador to NATO during the George W. Bush administration who also served on Bill Clinton’s National Security Council, said of Mr. Trump. “They find his policy positions beyond the pale, and they’re also turned off by his vulgarity. ” To that end, the Clinton campaign and its outside advisers have embarked on an effort to reach out to prominent moderate Republicans who could endorse Mrs. Clinton, largely making the case for foreign policy  . Those calls have included to an aide of the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and to Nicholas F. Brady, who served as secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Reagan and the elder Mr. Bush, with plans to reach out to James A. Baker III, a White House chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state under President George Bush. In her debates with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has defended her foreign policy decisions, including urging the Obama administration to join a   coalition to oust Col. Muammar   in Libya and her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, which she later said was a mistake. In an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Trump criticized Mrs. Clinton’s early support for the Iraq war, which he said he opposed, and questioned her judgment in Libya. “Bernie Sanders said it and I’m going to use it all over the place because it’s true,” Mr. Trump said. “She is a woman who is   to be president because she has bad judgment. ” As each candidate argues the other is unfit to occupy the Oval Office, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers are preparing to make a case against Mr. Trump that will be jarringly different from the sparring of past presidential campaigns over foreign policy. “It’s not like the campaign against McCain or Romney, which was two competing visions,” said Derek Chollet, a former White House and Pentagon official under President Obama. Instead, he said, Mrs. Clinton will remind voters that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the North Korean government of Kim   have expressed support for Mr. Trump, who has suggested a willingness to talk directly with Mr. Kim, a pariah worldwide. Mrs. Clinton will also accuse Mr. Trump of bluster and oratory that is in direct opposition to the bipartisan pillars of American diplomacy that every president has adhered to since World War II. Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pointed to Mr. Trump’s suggestion that the United States rethink its involvement in NATO, the   coalition of European nations. Mrs. Clinton, she added, needed to explain to voters that “every single president over the last couple decades has understood the value of alliances” and that “playing by the rules makes sense for all of us. ” Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was “fraudulent” in her misrepresentation of his foreign policy positions, explaining that he supported global alliances, but believed that the United States should shoulder less of the financial burden. “Our country can’t afford to protect the world anymore, and at least not get reimbursed for it,” he said. Mrs. Clinton has delivered a series of foreign policy speeches over the course of the nominating fight that included calling for accelerating the   operation to defeat the Islamic State, ending the economic embargo against Cuba, and pledging unwavering support of Israel. And she had already begun to lay the groundwork against what she called Mr. Trump’s “reckless actions” on foreign policy. The San Diego speech, to be delivered in a city known for its military presence at a time when Mr. Trump is facing scrutiny over his donations to veterans’ groups, will present a more sweeping  —   and fearsome  —   portrayal of Mr. Trump, one that the Clinton campaign will deliver like a drumbeat to voters in the coming months. “There’s not a lot of room left in terms of new proposals,” Mr. Sullivan said. “This is a speech about a vision and principle and purpose, not individual policy proposals. ” The prospect of a foreign policy debate not centered on policy differences has confounded Mrs. Clinton’s advisers, who in a more traditional election would be facing questions about Mrs. Clinton’s call for a   zone with coalition forces to protect Syrians or how she would handle the flood of migrants to Europe. But Mr. Trump, in addressing foreign policy, has largely relied on gut instinct and appealing to voters’ emotional concerns that America has lost its standing in the world. “You do get the sense that he’s in a dialogue with a part of the electorate  —   and I consider it a minority  —   that couldn’t be less interested in facts or realities,” said Daniel Benjamin, coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department under Mrs. Clinton. “That’s a really challenging task that most of us were unprepared for in many ways. ”"
20439,Hillary Clinton Warns That Donald Trump’s ‘Thin Skin’ Would Set Off War or Economic Crisis - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick and Mark Landler,B,2016-06-03,2016.0,6.0,,"Hillary Clinton delivered a lacerating rebuke on Thursday of her likely Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, declaring that he was hopelessly unprepared and temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief. Electing him, she said, would be a “historic mistake. ” Speaking in a steady, modulated tone but lobbing some of the most fiery lines of her presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton painted Mr. Trump as a reckless, childish and uninformed amateur who was playing at the game of global statecraft. “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,” she said, “because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. ” Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign had grappled for weeks over how to handle Mr. Trump, seemed to find her footing as she addressed an audience in San Diego that laughed and cheered as she deconstructed Mr. Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements. They were, she said, “not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies. ” The speech, which mixed biting sarcasm and somber assessments of the foreign crises of the Obama years, unfurled what is likely to be the core argument that Mrs. Clinton will carry into the general election. Her remarks were billed as a major foreign policy address, and she was flanked by a row of 19 American flags as majestic as those that often back Mr. Trump at his public events. Yet the speech was devoid of new policy prescriptions, and she skipped over difficult episodes during her tenure as secretary of state, including the NATO intervention in Libya and its bloody aftermath in Benghazi. Instead she borrowed a tactic from President Obama, reeling off zingers that are catnip to   channels. It won her the kind of sustained live coverage that Mr. Trump has enjoyed routinely but Mrs. Clinton has not, though the announcement by Speaker Paul D. Ryan that he planned to vote for Mr. Trump stole her thunder in the opening moments of the   address. She said she imagined Mr. Trump was “composing nasty tweets” about her even as she spoke. And indeed he was: “Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton!” Mr. Trump wrote. “Reading poorly from the teleprompter! She doesn’t even look presidential. ” But Mrs. Clinton sought to turn Mr. Trump’s prolific Twitter habit into an additional bullet point demonstrating that he was “unfit” for the presidency, as she put it. She twice referred to the scene in the White House Situation Room where as secretary of state, she advised Mr. Obama on the raid on a compound in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. “Imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making    decisions on behalf of the United States,” Mrs. Clinton said, eliciting cries of “No!” from her audience. “Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he’s angry, but America’s entire arsenal. ” In an interview with The New York Times during Mrs. Clinton’s speech, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton’s performance was “terrible” and “pathetic. ” He added: “I’m not   at all. I’m the opposite of  . ” For Mrs. Clinton, whose formal speeches tend to be earnest and laden with policy prescriptions, it was a striking departure  —   a rollicking political indictment that doubled as Mrs. Clinton’s first   response to Mr. Trump’s drumbeat of criticism about her ethics and judgment during a   in public life. The speech came after weeks of study by Clinton aides to determine which attacks by Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals had not worked. It was studded with punch lines: Mr. Trump “doesn’t have a clue what he’s talking about,” Mrs. Clinton said at one point. “Donald doesn’t see the complexity,” she said at another. “This isn’t reality television,” she said of a Trump presidency. “This is actual reality. ” After her campaign had initially issued a tepid response to Mr. Trump’s proposal of defaulting on the national debt, calling the idea “risky,” Mrs. Clinton said Thursday that such action would lead to “an economic catastrophe. ” “He believes we can treat the U. S. economy like one of his casinos,” she said. The speech was roughly 10 days in the making and written by Mrs. Clinton’s speechwriters, Dan Schwerin and Megan Rooney, and top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, with outside advisers including Mr. Obama’s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, reviewing a late draft. Ms. Rooney, a former State Department speechwriter, was perched on the arm of Mrs. Clinton’s chair on a flight from Boston to San Diego on Wednesday night, making revisions on her laptop and making sure the lines echoed Mrs. Clinton’s sardonic humor. The address was a meaty rebuttal to Democrats who had expressed concern that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign lacked gumption in going after Mr. Trump, particularly because Mr. Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have relished opportunities to skewer him. By turns mocking and stern, Mrs. Clinton derided Mr. Trump for suggesting that Japan should acquire nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, that the United States should have walked away from the nuclear deal with Iran, and that “maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS. ” “He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,” Mrs. Clinton said. “And to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are, and I quote, a ‘  country. ’” In vivid strokes, Mrs. Clinton framed not just her case against Mr. Trump but the broader   debate in the election: She cast herself as the defender of an   world order against an insurgent who did not understand, let alone respect, the network of alliances the United States constructed after World War II to safeguard its interests. Mrs. Clinton presented herself as a   commander in chief, a fervent believer in America as an exceptional country, tested by her time in the Situation Room. She highlighted her ability to go “toe to toe” with leaders in Beijing and Moscow, contrasting that with what she said was Mr. Trump’s “bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. ” “I’ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants,” she said. “I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America’s real friends are. ” Even as she excoriated Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton kept a close eye on domestic politics. She noted, for example, that she understood the deep qualms that voters had with trade deals. Still, Mr. Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, Mrs. Clinton said, would set off a trade war of the kind that deepened the Great Depression in the 1930s. Mrs. Clinton recited a handful of highlights from her time at the State Department, including her role in brokering a   between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in 2012 and rallying the world to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. But she failed to flesh out her proposals for dealing with the Islamic State or the civil war in Syria. To Mrs. Clinton, such policy details were not as important as the    differences between her and Mr. Trump. “He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists, even though those are war crimes,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He says he doesn’t have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has, quote, ‘a very good brain. ’” “He also said, ‘I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.’ You know what?” she continued. “I don’t believe him. ” Mrs. Clinton ended her remarks on a more solemn note, arguing that Mr. Trump’s proposals, like barring Muslims from entering the United States, “could fuel an ugly narrative about who we are. ” Mr. Trump, she said, would undo decades of statecraft by Republicans and Democrats. Striking a bipartisan note, Mrs. Clinton recalled an advertisement Mr. Trump took out in newspapers in 1987, during the Reagan administration, “saying that America lacked a backbone and that the world was, you guessed it, laughing at us. ” “You’ve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America and has felt that way for at least 30 years wants to be our president,” she said."

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton launched a blistering attack on Donald Trump. She called his foreign policy ideas “dangerously incoherent” and said he could lead the country into war “just because somebody got under his very thin skin. ” But the Republican establishment continued closing ranks. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, finally endorsed Mr. Trump, and Karl Rove, who has called Mr. Trump “a complete idiot” has met with him. _____ 2. Federal regulators are trying to rein in the payday loan industry, which has trapped many   Americans in a cycle of debt. New rules that could go into effect next year include a limit on the number of times that borrowers can roll over their   loans into newer, pricier ones. Lenders could fight the constraints in court. _____ 3. The official cause of Prince’s death was an accidental overdose of a painkiller many times more powerful than heroin. The coroner’s report, delayed for weeks until a toxicology report could be completed, specified fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller given much of the blame for the high mortality rate of the opioid epidemic. _____ 4. The N. B. A. finals feature the same teams as they did last year, but this year’s series isn’t your basic rematch. The defending champion, the Golden State Warriors, and the Cleveland Cavaliers have both evolved, with the Cavaliers better equipped to match the Warriors’ shooting. But the Cavs didn’t show evidence of that in Game 1, when they lost,   despite limiting Stephen Curry, the Warriors’ guard, to just 11 points. _____ 5. Big news for opera fans: The Metropolitan Opera named a successor to James Levine, its first leadership transition in decades. The new guy is Yannick   41, widely regarded as a brilliant conductor. But the Met faces a long wait for his attention. He does not officially begin until the   season  —   and plans to remain as artistic director at the Philadelphia Orchestra. _____ 6. President François Hollande declared a natural disaster for the region around Paris, as days of torrential rain sent the Seine 18 feet above its typical level. The Louvre and Musée d’Orsay prepared to evacuate some of their masterpieces. The storm system, which caused flooding in much of central and northeastern France, also inundated southwestern Germany, killing at least nine. _____ 7. The former graduate student who fatally shot this professor at U. C. L. A. and then killed himself on Wednesday is suspected in another homicide. Police officers who searched his residence in Minnesota found a list of people he apparently intended to kill. Officers then found one of them, a woman, shot to death at her nearby home. _____ 8. Germany passed a symbolic resolution calling the killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in the early 20th century genocide. The move strains relations at a time when Europe needs Turkey’s help in managing the migrant crisis. The Turkish government denounced the vote as “null and void. ” _____ 9. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the   company Theranos and the rare   female billionaire, was ignominiously jettisoned from the heights of Forbes’s “richest” lists. The magazine sharply lowered its valuation of Theranos, noting questions about the accuracy of its tests and a welter of investigations, and put Ms. Holmes’s net value at zero  —   down from $4. 5 billion. _____ 10. A special neighborhood has been growing in the upper reaches of New York City’s skyscrapers. This week, our Magazine ascends into the rarefied living spaces, offices and construction sites above 800 feet. Its denizens are proud, sometimes rivalrous, occasionally poetic and, at least in one case, humble. “You realize how small you are and how big the world is,” said a man who sees the city from the 85th floor of 1 World Trade. _____ 11. And finally, there’s a show worth watching even higher than that. Thanks to a celestial alignment, Saturn will be visible all night. The best time to see it will be after midnight local time, when the ringed planet will hang highest. Look for a golden orb just to the left of Mars, a crimson dot.

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Democrats seemed relieved and pleased a day after Hillary Clinton used a major speech to ridicule Donald J. Trump. Some Republicans fretted that Mr. Trump might not be up to the task of repelling such attacks. “I thought it was one of the most important speeches Secretary Clinton has made throughout this campaign,” said Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary under President Obama and chief of staff for Bill Clinton. _____ 2. The judge hearing a   lawsuit by former students of Trump University is a cool customer, his friends say. That temperament is said to be helping the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, weather unusual public criticism by Mr. Trump. His attacks on Judge Curiel, including calling out his Mexican heritage, are part of a pattern of behavior that has led some scholars to question Mr. Trump’s respect for the rule of law. _____ 3. Officials in Chicago released videos and other materials from 101 cases in which police officers had shot or otherwise injured civilians. The officials said many of the videos were not illuminating, but the disclosure was unusual for a city whose police department has a reputation for secrecy. The head of the investigative agency behind the release said it represented “an important step” toward increased transparency. _____ 4. As flooding in Paris threatened the Louvre, staff members and volunteers worked to remove  art from harm’s way. Nearly 160, 000 works were moved to higher floors from storage areas and galleries. Rain has lifted the Seine River to its highest levels since 1982. _____ 5. The U. S. economic recovery isn’t quite as robust as analysts had hoped: Employers added just 38, 000 workers in May, the lowest monthly growth since September 2010. But the numbers aren’t as foreboding as they seem, our analyst writes. Averaging job growth over the past three months shows a more modest slowdown. _____ 6. Nest, a digital device maker  Google bought for $3. 2 billion in 2014, drew comparisons to Apple with its innovative approach to bringing unglamorous household devices like thermostats into sync with a digital world. Its   Tony Fadell said Friday that he was leaving because Nest was in “maintenance mode. ” But the departure came after reports that Nest had a harsh corporate culture and Mr. Fadell an abrasive style. _____ 7. It’s a big weekend in sports, kicking off tonight at 9:30 Eastern time with the first game of the Copa América soccer tournament, pitting the United States against Colombia. On Saturday, Serena Williams goes for her 22nd major championship in the French Open final, and the Pittsburgh Penguins shoot for a   lead over the San Jose Sharks in the Stanley Cup finals. Sunday brings Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray competing in the French Open final, while the Cleveland Cavaliers, down   to the Golden State Warriors in the N. B. A. finals, try to tie the series. _____ 8. If you’re looking for a movie to watch this weekend, our critics say the mockumentary “Popstar: Never Stop Stopping” is one of your best bets. It features Andy Samberg as a Justin   pop idol, and “takes aim at everything that is artificial and plastic in contemporary pop in a spirit of love rather than spite,” A. O. Scott writes. Ostensibly more serious fare: “Me Before You” is the story of a romance between a paralyzed aristocrat and the woman hired to keep him company. But Mr. Scott finds it to be ridiculous. _____ 9. Most West African capitals are scenes of sartorial flair, but the bright patterns adorning skirts and dresses worn by women there are more than just eye candy. Messages ranging from the playful to the political are encoded within the prints. During election season, clothes sporting the face of a politician can signify support  —   although that depends on where the face is placed. _____ 10. A    Japanese boy survived six nights alone on the   island of Hokkaido. He had wandered off after being left on the side of the road by his parents as a disciplinary measure, and was found by soldiers on a military base about three miles away. “I’m full of gratitude. From now on, I’m going to take better care of him as he grows up,” the boy’s father said. _____ 11. In other rescue news, a    Florida fisherman who fell out of his boat without a life jacket was saved by the Coast Guard after 20 exhausting hours treading water, a local news channel reported. The man, William Durden, said the night was an ordeal but when the sun came up, he felt a surge of optimism. He felt fish hitting his legs, but his fears that a shark “would come out and decide to have me for dinner” went unrealized. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

20494,Hillary Clinton Clinches the Nomination. Will Bernie Sanders Fight On? - The New York Times,New York Times,Alexander Burns,M,2016-06-08,2016.0,6.0,,"Democrats will vote in six states on Tuesday, just hours after Hillary Clinton secured enough superdelegates, according to a survey by The Associated Press, to make her the party’s presumptive presidential nominee. But the focus will be on just one of those states: California, the nation’s most populous state and a liberal stronghold, where Senator Bernie Sanders is hoping to seize a victory to make the case for staying in the race until the party’s convention in July. The question of the day is not whether Mrs. Clinton will declare victory, but in what terms, and how she will begin to frame the general election race against Donald J. Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee. But there will also be something to watch on the Republican side, as Mr. Trump is expected to hold a news conference in New York to mark the end of primary season. He has been heavily criticized  —   including by many in his own party  —   for his attacks on a federal judge’s Mexican heritage, and he faces questions about how he will respond. Voting will also take place on Tuesday in Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. Here are a few of the dynamics we’ll be watching: In her speech Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton will become the first woman to claim victory in a major party’s presidential nominating fight. She has intermittently emphasized the historic nature of her candidacy, and it may work to her benefit to stress that theme amid Mr. Trump’s continuing struggles with female voters. But Mrs. Clinton also has a broader choice to make, about how to position herself in one of the   moments of her campaign: Will she move to calm Sanders supporters and consolidate support on the left, or reach out to moderates and Republicans who may be wary of Mr. Trump? Will she go after Mr. Trump in hard language, or focus on sketching a positive rationale for her own election? Her choices Tuesday night could set the shape of the race between now and the conventions in July. The slim path available to Mr. Sanders narrowed even further Monday evening with the news report that Mrs. Clinton had crossed the   threshold through support from party leaders. In order to press forward, Mr. Sanders is in dire need of an upset win in California. By taking the nation’s most populous state, his supporters hope, Mr. Sanders could claim a mandate to keep fighting all the way to the convention in Philadelphia. He is likely to face intensifying pressure from Democrats  —   including the White House  —   to get out of Mrs. Clinton’s way. But Mr. Sanders has never been a creature of the Democratic Party. His natural mode is defiance. As Mrs. Clinton aims to rally Democrats, it is in Mr. Sanders’s power to make that process easy or acutely uncomfortable. His reaction to Tuesday’s results may signal which path he intends to take. Mrs. Clinton is favored to win the primary in New Jersey and has a narrower lead over Mr. Sanders in California polls. She is poised to secure her party’s nomination regardless of what happens in each state, but sweeping both would lend her candidacy an especially formidable air at the start of the campaign against Mr. Trump. Capturing California, one of the most racially diverse states, would hand Mrs. Clinton a useful symbolic victory as she prepares to compete with a Republican whose support has come overwhelmingly from whites. Republican concern about Mr. Trump is approaching a high: His last remaining primary challengers dropped out of the race more than a month ago, but the real estate developer has done little in that time to gird himself for a contest with Mrs. Clinton. Over the last week, Mr. Trump has inflicted more damage to his candidacy than Senator Ted Cruz or Gov. John R. Kasich ever did. He has struggled to answer newly detailed and troubling allegations that his defunct educational company, Trump University, committed fraud, and he has repeatedly criticized a federal judge who is hearing a   lawsuit against him, accusing the judge, who is of Mexican descent, of having a conflict of interest. It will take a firm performance by Mr. Trump on the podium in Westchester County on Tuesday night to reassure Republicans that he is up to the job of fighting Mrs. Clinton. Another undisciplined and combative outing could raise the party’s anxiety to the level of panic. President Obama has appeared eager, even impatient, to take part in the campaign, and he has already gone after Mr. Trump repeatedly. But Mr. Obama has been somewhat constrained so far by the Democratic primaries. While he has been critical of Republicans, he has not yet made a   case for Mrs. Clinton as a better alternative. The White House has indicated that may change this week, once Mrs. Clinton has the Democratic nomination in hand. A presidential endorsement would be seen by many Democrats as a signal to Mr. Sanders that it’s time for him to leave the race. And Mr. Obama, who has long been adept at belittling Mr. Trump, could be an effective advocate for Mrs. Clinton as she seeks to energize the Democratic coalition and set the terms of debate against an unpredictable opponent."
20495,"Hillary Clinton’s Long, Grueling Quest - The New York Times",New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-06-09,2016.0,6.0,,"If there was a single moment that captured what would carry Hillary Clinton to the 2016 Democratic nomination, it came not during her   campaign kickoff in New York last June, or in any of her speeches celebrating   primary victories over Senator Bernie Sanders. No, it was the unscripted instant in which a blasé Mrs. Clinton coolly brushed from her shoulder a speck of lint, dirt  —   or perhaps nothing at all  —   as a   House panel subjected her to more than eight hours of questioning in October over her handling of the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. She may not be the orator President Obama is, or the retail politician her husband was. But Mrs. Clinton’s steely fortitude in this campaign has plainly inspired older women, black voters and many others who see in her perseverance a kind of mirror to their own struggles. And Mrs. Clinton’s very durability  —   her tenacity, grit and capacity for enduring and overcoming adversity  —   could be exactly what is required to defeat Donald J. Trump. As a politician’s wife, first lady, senator and secretary of state  —   and as a   candidate for president  —   Mrs. Clinton, 68, has redefined the role of women in American politics each time she has reinvented herself. She has transfixed the nation again and again, as often in searing episodes of scandal or setback as in triumph. “She came on the public stage as someone who was a little different,” said Ann Lewis, a longtime adviser. “She attracted fascination, devotion and attacks  —   and the partisan attacks haven’t stopped. ” “Even as first lady, it was ‘Who does she think she is? ’” said Melanne Verveer, a close friend of Mrs. Clinton’s who was her White House chief of staff. Mrs. Clinton’s confidants say it is only fitting that, having overcome so many obstacles before, including some of her own making, she now faces an opponent so eager to go negative with her  —   and to refight the   brawls that have defined her career. In her victory speech Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton said the biggest influence on her life had been her mother, “and she taught me never to back down from a bully  —   which turned out to be pretty good advice. ” It was with that same grit that Mrs. Clinton picked herself up after a bruising defeat by Mr. Obama in 2008, when she assured a crowd of tearful female supporters, eight years ago to the day, that they had made 18 million cracks in “the highest, hardest glass ceiling. ” For 14 straight years, and 20 in all, Mrs. Clinton has been named the woman Americans admire most, according to a yearly Gallup poll. But her campaign, and the controversy over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, have taken a toll: Her favorability and trustworthiness ratings have plummeted. And she is being caricatured, once more, as a calculating and inauthentic career politician: Lady Macbeth, now in her own play. In the same way, her longevity and fame are not undiluted assets: The baggage she brings as a consummate Democratic insider, pointed up most damagingly in the enormous sums she commanded as a paid speaker to Wall Street banks, has weighed Mrs. Clinton down in an election cycle in which outsiders have had the wind at their backs. Mrs. Clinton’s career has not taken a predictable route by any stretch. She came of age in the feminist movement in the 1960s at Wellesley College  —   where she urged her peers to spurn incremental change and instead work at “making the impossible possible”  —   then was drawn to the South in furtherance of her husband’s ambitions. She was one of her husband’s chief campaign strategists and overseer of a failed health care effort, while holding her marriage together through his sex scandals and impeachment. But if she seemed to embody contradictions, they also reflected a society in which expectations of women, and women’s expectations for themselves, were rapidly changing. And it has always been hard to parse opinions about Mrs. Clinton and about powerful women in general. Roy M. Neel, who was a campaign manager for Al Gore in his 1992   run, said in an oral history of the Bill Clinton years that women in the South particularly disliked Mrs. Clinton, the first working mother to serve as first lady and the first  —   and, so far, the only  —   to have an office in the West Wing, because she “appeared to be something of an affront to their sense of who they were. ” If   antipathies to Mrs. Clinton can be chalked up in part to Americans’ struggles to adjust to changing gender roles at home, at work and in politics, her history of political combat has also left scar tissue that, in part, defines the candidate she is:   about the realities of Washington, but cautious and wary to a fault. Her prolonged contest with Mr. Sanders, whose campaign was not widely expected to survive the first few nominating contests, laid bare the cost of that restraint, both in style and substance. As voters have gravitated to Mr. Trump’s unchecked impulsiveness and Mr. Sanders’s unabashed idealism, Mrs. Clinton has displayed little of either. “This is not an incremental, cautious election, and being cautious is not her friend,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “Both primaries exposed the depth of anger and frustration and disgust,” she added. “She has had to, and will have to, adjust to it. ” For 14 months, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has been out of step with younger voters and with swaths of an angry electorate that has demanded more than the competence and hard work she has promised. Her difficulties with those voters could be a warning sign. While her husband could draw on the crisp centrist philosophy of the “third way” Democrats in 1992, when he devoted his candidacy to the “forgotten middle class,” Mrs. Clinton has struggled to hit upon as simple and clear a rationale for her campaign. And, though she has issued the most detailed policy proposals and positions of anyone in the race, what she truly believes remains a mystery for many voters. Mrs. Clinton has praised Mr. Obama’s accomplishments over the past eight years, and won roughly 77 percent of the vote among blacks through the May 10 contests, according to exit polls. But she has also promised to push harder than Mr. Obama in extending citizenship to undocumented immigrants, opposed his signature   trade deal, and outstripped his plans to defeat the Islamic State by calling for a   zone in Syria. She has praised her husband’s economic record as president and offered to put him in charge of reviving some of the   regions. But Mrs. Clinton has also had to repudiate crucial parts of her husband’s legacy. It has not helped that her campaign has cycled through a   slogans, from championing “everyday Americans” to “fighting for us,” “breaking down barriers,” and, most recently, “stronger together”  —   playing on Mr. Trump’s more divisive remarks about Mexicans, Muslims and other groups. As Mr. Sanders has demonized Wall Street and Mr. Trump has disparaged immigrants, and as they have vowed to reverse economic malaise, Mrs. Clinton has run on a flinty practicality. The most telling promise she has made is that she will not overpromise. “We don’t need any more of that,” she has told voters. But what she has lacked in rhetorical brio, she has made up for by listening to people’s problems and prescribing solutions. She has shed tears in conversations with a man whose mother had Alzheimer’s and a woman who lost a child to a gun accident. And she has shown a vulnerability she did not reveal in 2008, when she campaigned as a strong   commander in chief, seeking to neutralize any doubts about whether she was tough enough for the Oval Office. “I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, like my husband or President Obama,” Mrs. Clinton said in one of her debates with Mr. Sanders, a bracingly honest statement. To her supporters, there may be a kind of strange logic at work. Mrs. Clinton is somehow expected to project the mettle of a commander in chief, the charisma of a drinking buddy, the warmth of a favorite aunt, they say. “You’re required to be   and smiley and also required to grow a hide like an elephant,” said Tina Brown, the journalist. “Which is it?” An impossible combination, they complain  —   and if she managed all that, there would no doubt emerge some other vital quality that she was failing to display, because there is no template yet for a female United States president. “People are so undecided about how they feel about female leadership, and it’s something people really struggle with,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. “The ambiguity about Hillary is outside of her. It comes from people’s own perspectives. ” Attitudes about female leadership eventually may change, of course. And in talking to reporters on Monday, hours before reports that she had clinched the nomination, Mrs. Clinton looked past November to a time when female presidential candidates may not require quite so much durability to have a shot at the White House. “It’s predominantly women and girls, but not exclusively  —   men bring their daughters to meet me and tell me that they are supporting me because of their daughters,” she said. “And I do think it will make a very big difference for a father or a mother to be able to look at their daughter just like they can look at their son and say, ‘You can be anything you want to be in this country, including president of the United States. ’”"

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Primaries in six states played out even as the presidential nominations seemed to be set. Hillary Clinton had already hit the delegate threshold to secure the Democratic nomination, but cemented her standing with a wins in New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. Bernie Sanders vowed to fight on, hoping a win in California might prompt superdelegates to defect to him. ______ 2. Donald Trump  said his comments about a Hispanic judge  —   suggesting he would not be able to handle a case against the   Trump University fairly because of his heritage  —   had been misconstrued. Mr. Trump spoke after Speaker Paul Ryan, above, called Mr. Trump’s criticism “the textbook definition of a racist comment” and “absolutely unacceptable. ” ______ 3. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, goaded by concern over a possible Trump presidency, showcased an unusually cooperative approach on his second visit to the White House in two years. He took crucial steps toward ratifying the Paris climate accord and finishing the purchase of nuclear reactors, with a military deal to come. “Modi wants to get as much as he can out of Obama’s last months in office,” an analyst said. ______ 4. More than 350, 000 people have signed a petition for the recall of a California judge who sentenced this Stanford University student, Brock Turner, to only six months in jail after he was convicted of sexual assault. The victim’s   cry for justice, published after the sentencing, has been viewed more than 8. 5 million times. ______ 5. Muhammad Ali died just as a foundation devoted to the photographer Gordon Parks was preparing to exhibit some of his images of the boxer.

The inmate testified that he was punched, kicked and stomped, and spat up blood for months. Several more accused officers are to hear their verdict on Friday. “Regrettably, some people think of prisoners as less than human,” said a lawyer. ______ 8. The Syrian president, Bashar   swore to retake “every inch” of territory lost in six years of civil war. His defiant address offered no hope that he would back a revival of talks to find a political solution. Meanwhile, U. N. officials said the Syrian authorities had delayed approval for desperately needed food aid for civilians trapped in a   area near the capital. ______ 9. Finally, the cosmologist Stephen Hawking, who suffers from a form of Lou Gehrig’s disease, made a significant addition to his groundbreaking work on black holes.

20505,"Hillary Clinton on Winning, and Why Her Mother Would Be Nervous - The New York Times",New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-06-09,2016.0,6.0,,"A day after claiming her party’s nomination for president, an exhilarated Hillary Clinton said she was “still processing” the emotions of the moment on Wednesday as she heard from people around the globe both excited about her success and deeply anxious about her Republican rival, Donald J. Trump. In a brief but at times introspective interview, Mrs. Clinton said that although other countries have been led by women, such a milestone would be different were it to happen in the United States. She called the demands of the American political system more personally grueling and difficult. “I really believe our system is probably the most challenging in the world,” Mrs. Clinton said. “If you’re a prime minister, you’re chosen by your peers,” she continued. “If you’re president, you run statewide, but it’s usually with the backing of a party and you don’t have to raise the money to run. ” But, she added, “Women candidates all face the same scrutiny, and questions about ourselves, so there are similarities. ” The implications of her claiming the Democratic nomination for president  —   the first woman to do so for a major American political party  —   became clear quickly for Mrs. Clinton, 68, in recent days. Prominent women and many male leaders have “reached out to me in recent days to encourage me and say how much this election means to their country and the world. ” “It’s something I’m still processing,” Mrs. Clinton added. Her comments came days before Mr. Trump plans to give a major speech seeking to revive the scandals of the 1990s that entangled Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill, and criticize the foundation the family has run. She vowed not to respond to his personal attacks and said she would continue to use his words against him. “I am responding to his very apparent lack of qualifications to be president based on what he has said and done and the temperamentally unfit person he is,” Mrs. Clinton said. She joined Republican leaders including Speaker Paul D. Ryan in denouncing Mr. Trump’s comments last week that a   judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel of United States District Court, had been biased against Mr. Trump because of his heritage. Mrs. Clinton went beyond her previous characterization of Mr. Trump’s remarks, saying on Wednesday that his attack on Judge Curiel based on his ethnicity was “an outrageous, racist attack. ” But even as Mrs. Clinton tried to portray a steely fortitude in facing Mr. Trump, and a determination not to allow his personal attacks to get her off course, she offered a glimpse of the toll that reliving some of her lowest and most publicly humiliating moments would take. Throughout her second presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton has drawn on the inspiration of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was born into poverty and neglect and taught her daughter, from an early age, to confront bullies and stand up for herself. “She was such a stalwart support in every way, mostly personal, but she would have been excited she would have been proud,” Mrs. Clinton said about how Mrs. Rodham would have viewed the events of the past few days. But, Mrs. Clinton also suggested that her mother would be eager to protect her from the attacks to come. “She might have been a little apprehensive,” she said. “This is a very big step. ” Mrs. Clinton offered a vigorous defense of a decision which has haunted her primary campaign  —   her acceptance of large amounts of money for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, a practice that even her most ardent supporters have viewed as puzzlingly  . Mrs. Clinton called such speeches that garner   fees “the norm” for previous secretaries of state. “I actually think it makes sense,” she added. When pressed on why, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the Occupy Wall Street movement, she chose to give such speeches, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that she had put forth “the most specific plan” of any candidate to regulate the financial industry. “A lot of people know you have a   seat in what is going on in the world, so maybe you have some interesting observations about political or economic concerns,” Mrs. Clinton explained. “That to me is how it came about, and that’s what I talked about when I was making speeches. ” During the interview, Mrs. Clinton seemed almost to be trying to grapple with the meaning of her achievement and the overall restive mood of the country. She seemed also to be wrestling with themes she publicly raised, at times to mockery, in her early years in the White House  —   about whether the country has lost its sense of larger mission and community. “It’s important people feel like they’re part of a larger national purpose,” Mrs. Clinton said. “It makes a big difference if people have jobs with dignity and purpose. ” “I’ve thought a lot and spoken about, from time to time,” the need for more “love and kindness. ” Or, as she put it in 1993, drawing on the reflections of the Republican operative Lee Atwater as he faced death, “a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. ” “I think in this campaign I’ve tried to raise some of those themes again,” she continued. Now that she has finished a primary battle that stretched on far longer than she expected, Mrs. Clinton, speaking from her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. planned to visit the local bookstore. “I’ll finally have a break where I’ll have some time,” she said. “I love to wander around bookstores and see what strikes my fancy. ” She pointed to one book she had read recently that she said would stay with her through the general election: the swimmer Diana Nyad’s memoir, “Find a Way,” about her nearly   swim at age 64 from Cuba to Florida. “When you’re facing big challenges in your life, you can think about Diana Nyad getting attacked by the lethal sting of box jellyfishes,” she said. “And nearly anything else seems doable in comparison. ” Asked if Mr. Trump would be her “box jellyfish” over the coming months, Mrs. Clinton let out a hearty laugh, then demurred. “I don’t know about that,” she said."
20506,"After Victory in California, Hillary Clinton Turns Toward Donald Trump - The New York Times",New York Times,Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin,M,2016-06-08,2016.0,6.0,,"Hillary Clinton claimed the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday night after decisive victories in the California, New Jersey and New Mexico primaries, and she quickly appealed to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to unite with her against Donald J. Trump. The Associated Press reported early Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton had won California, but Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he would yield, insisting earlier that he would continue his campaign and barely acknowledging her achievement. With the   Democratic race nearing a close, Mrs. Clinton savored the biggest night of her extraordinary journey from lawyer, wife and first lady to senator, secretary of state and, now, the first woman to win a major party’s nomination. At a rally in Brooklyn, she took the stage with her hands clasped over her heart in gratitude, then threw open her arms in joy and savored a long moment as a jubilant crowd waved American flags and chanted “Hillary. ” Reaching for history, Mrs. Clinton pledged to build on the achievements of pioneers like the   leaders at Seneca Falls, N. Y. who began the fight for women’s rights in America. “Tonight caps an amazing journey  —   a long, long journey,” she said, nearly a century after women won the right to vote nationwide. “We all owe so much to those who came before, and tonight belongs to all of you. ” As six states voted on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders’s political lifeline frayed with each loss. He was left hoping for a   victory in the California primary, to justify staying in the race and lobbying Democratic officials to support him in a contested convention next month. In a speech in Santa Monica, Calif. late Tuesday night that felt much like a valedictory, Mr. Sanders told supporters he was determined to stop Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, from winning the presidency. Yet he spoke of their cause as much larger than his candidacy. “You all know that it is more than Bernie  —   it is all of us together,” he said. He vowed to “fight hard to win” the final primary, in the District of Columbia next week, and to continue “our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice” at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. But he also recognized cold political reality. “I am pretty good in arithmetic, and I know that the fight in front of us is a very, very steep fight,” he said. “But we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate we can get. ” While Mr. Sanders noticeably ignored Mrs. Clinton’s triumph, only crediting “her victories tonight,” she lavished praise on him earlier at her Brooklyn rally. She said their “vigorous debate” had been “very good for the Democratic Party and America. ” Mr. Sanders won the North Dakota caucuses and the Montana primary, while Mrs. Clinton won the South Dakota primary. Republicans also voted in several states. Though Mr. Sanders made plans to lay off much of his campaign staff, he appeared reluctant to let go completely after months of political warfare against a Clinton machine that he holds in thinly veiled contempt. President Obama plans to meet with Mr. Sanders at the White House on Thursday at the candidate’s request, an administration spokesman said, adding that Mr. Obama had called both Democratic candidates Tuesday night to congratulate them on “running inspiring campaigns. ” As Mrs. Clinton sought to turn her attention to the general election, Mr. Trump, who had a weekslong head start, was busy reckoning with problems of his own making. His criticism of a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, for the judge’s Mexican heritage continued to inflict damage on his campaign, as the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, called Mr. Trump’s remarks racist and other Republicans piled on. One Republican senator rescinded his support. Mr. Trump, speaking in Briarcliff Manor, N. Y. pledged to make Republicans “proud of our party and our movement,” though he did not try to defuse the controversy. Instead, reading carefully from a teleprompter, he mounted a lengthy attack on Mrs. Clinton’s record, saying she had “turned the State Department into her private hedge fund. ” And he teased a speech, “on probably Monday of next week,” that he said would delve into “all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. ” Mr. Trump explicitly reached out to Sanders supporters, who he said had been “left out in the cold by a rigged system. ” “We can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems,” he said. “The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. ” Mrs. Clinton returned fire at Mr. Trump in her remarks, charging that he “wants to win by stoking fear and rubbing salt into wounds. ” Yet she avoided the sort of slashing attacks and ridicule that she used to great effect in her indictment of Mr. Trump and his temperament last week. Scarcely raising her voice on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton again looked to the example of an influential woman, this time tenderly invoking her mother. “She told me to never back down from a bully, which it turns out was pretty good advice,” she said. Although Tuesday had promised to be a watershed moment in the nation’s political history, it proved anticlimactic after The A. P. reported Monday night that Mrs. Clinton had secured enough delegates to clinch the party’s nomination. But she stuck to her plan to use her rally, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, to celebrate her achievement with some of the same New York Democrats who helped her win a Senate seat in 2000, beginning her career in elected office. The unexpected news on Monday set off conversations within the two campaigns, with Clinton representatives preparing to make overtures to the Sanders camp as early as Wednesday. Sanders advisers were on edge over the declaration that Mrs. Clinton had locked up the nomination, worried that it would depress voter turnout in California. And Mr. Sanders told NBC on Tuesday evening that he was “upset” and “disappointed” that The A. P. had made its call based on a survey of superdelegates, party officials who can shift their allegiances as late as the convention. Mr. Sanders said that his aides were “on the phone right now” with superdelegates, including those supporting Mrs. Clinton. “Defying history is what this campaign has been about,” he said of his bid, which was initially seen as a long shot. “I am going to be meeting with our supporters to figure out the best way forward so that we have a government which represents all of us, and not just the 1 percent. ” His campaign also emailed supporters late Tuesday asking them to commit to vote for him in the final Democratic primary, in the District of Columbia next Tuesday, suggesting that Mr. Sanders was not calling it quits just yet. Still, he planned to let go a large number of workers on Wednesday, according to current and former aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Part of Mr. Sanders’s challenge is that his justifications for continuing his campaign are increasingly thin. Mrs. Clinton has now won a majority of the 4, 051 pledged delegates at stake in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, crossing what Mr. Sanders had long held up as a critical threshold. She also has support from 571 superdelegates to Mr. Sanders’s 48 only about 100 uncommitted superdelegates remain. The campaign managers for Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have been speaking recently, including early on Tuesday, about the future of the race and about policy priorities for the party’s convention platform in July, according to two Democrats close to the candidates. So far, the discussions have not included the possibility that Mr. Sanders will concede to Mrs. Clinton or endorse her, the Democrats said, but the groundwork has been laid for an eventual conversation or meeting. Several advisers to Mr. Sanders said Tuesday that he had not been inviting opinions or holding meetings about whether to withdraw from the race, nor had he sketched out a speech announcing the suspension of his campaign. They said he had been wholly focused on winning the California primary in hopes that a victory in such a politically important state would help him lobby superdelegates to shift their support. “Moving a lot of superdelegates into our column will require a big campaign of persuasion, a nationwide logistical effort, but we believe we have a strong case to make to them  —   especially if we do very well in Tuesday’s primaries,” said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. Other campaign advisers said they expected Mr. Sanders to consider his options during his flight from California to Vermont on Wednesday. One recalled that Mrs. Clinton did much the same when she found herself in a similar situation eight years ago. The day after Barack Obama clinched the Democratic nomination in June 2008, Mrs. Clinton huddled with her advisers and debated whether to hold on to her delegates and try to force a contested convention. She decided to endorse Mr. Obama instead. The two had a tense but productive meeting that Thursday night, and two days later she delivered a speech thanking her supporters and urging them to unite around the party’s presumptive nominee. The resistance of many of Mr. Sanders’s supporters to Mrs. Clinton is likely to soften once Mr. Sanders leaves the race, and especially if he endorses her. But Clinton advisers and allies say they will need his help to bring around the many younger voters and liberals who prefer him. If Mrs. Clinton is beginning the general election with many Sanders supporters incensed at her, Mr. Trump is in the midst of his own   crisis. He is forcing Republicans to confront a painful choice: Embrace his brand of racial politics, one that could taint the party’s image well beyond this election, or abandon their presumptive nominee and hand the White House to the Democrats for another four years. But Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, pointing both to the threat from Mr. Trump and to her chance at making history, predicted that she would have an easier time bringing her party together than Mr. Trump would his. “I think that will sink in over the next few weeks and months and will go a long way to helping unite the party,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said. “I was on the bike this morning and saw on TV that Monday night, Hillary had won the nomination, and I got  . From a   perspective, it’s an amazing accomplishment. ”"
20507,"Hillary Clinton Made History, but Bernie Sanders Stubbornly Ignored It - The New York Times",New York Times,Michael Barbaro and Yamiche Alcindor,B,2016-06-09,2016.0,6.0,,"Revolutions rarely give way to gracious expressions of defeat. And so, despite the crushing California results that rolled in for him on Tuesday night, despite the insurmountable delegate math and the growing pleas that he end his quest for the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders took to the stage in Santa Monica and basked, bragged and vowed to fight on. In a speech of striking stubbornness, he ignored the   achievement of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who became the first woman in American history to clinch the presidential nomination of a major political party. Mr. Sanders waited until 15 minutes into his speech to utter Mrs. Clinton’s name. He referred, almost in passing, to a telephone conversation in which he had congratulated her on her victories. At that, the crowd of more than 3, 000 inside an aging airport hangar booed loudly. Mr. Sanders did little to discourage them. Tuesday was, undeniably, Mrs. Clinton’s night, a milestone for women in politics and civic life 95 years after the 19th Amendment guaranteed their right to vote. But by Wednesday morning, all eyes were on Mr. Sanders. Would he be generous or petulant? Would he let go or keep battling? At almost every turn, he was grudging toward Mrs. Clinton, passing up a chance to issue the kind of lengthy salute that many, in and out of the Democratic Party, had expected and craved. “It’s a blown opportunity to build bridges that are going to be extremely important in the fall,” said David Gergen, an adviser to four presidents, both Democratic and Republican. He worried that Mr. Sanders was becoming “a grumpy old man. ” The raw math is brutal and indisputable: Mrs. Clinton has not just crossed the threshold of 2, 383 delegates needed to secure the nomination. As of Tuesday night, she had succeeded in winning a majority of pledged delegates, a majority of the states that have held primaries, and the popular vote. This would be the time, under normal circumstances, for a primary rival to acknowledge insurmountable odds, pay tribute to a prevailing opponent and begin the work of stitching together a divided political party. That was the conciliatory message that a vanquished Mrs. Clinton delivered eight years ago to the day, on June 7, 2008, four days after Barack Obama had sealed his party’s nomination  —   a contest that was mathematically closer than the one with Mr. Sanders now. “We all know this has been a tough fight,” Mrs. Clinton said at the time. “But the Democratic Party is a family. And now, it’s time to restore the ties that bind us together. ” On Tuesday, she was effusive in her praise of Mr. Sanders and in her outreach to his supporters, mentioning him by name three times in her victory address in Brooklyn. “Let there be no mistake,’’ she said. “Senator Sanders, his campaign, and the vigorous debate that we’ve had about how to raise incomes, reduce inequality, increase upward mobility have been very good for the Democratic Party and for America. ’’ But Mr. Sanders, who calls himself a revolutionary, is openly skeptical of the traditions and expectations that govern the party whose nomination he covets. Throughout his campaign, he has regarded the Democratic Party itself with suspicion and distrust. Party unity, it seems, is the farthest thing from his mind at the moment. Far from backing down, Mr. Sanders promised to take his campaign to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this summer, raising the possibility that he could remain in the race, without ever conceding defeat, until July. “We will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate we can get,” Mr. Sanders thundered. Declaring that the movement he has begun is “more than Bernie,” Mr. Sanders sounded at times messianic. “Our vision,” he said, “will be the future of America. ” Inside the airport hangar in Santa Monica, anger at Mrs. Clinton, and at the establishment she exemplifies, was visceral and abundant, overshadowing her electoral advantage and   night. Freddie Paull, a    filmmaker from Glendale, Calif. was not interested in milestones. He said he thought Mrs. Clinton was a crook. “She could be indicted literally tomorrow if the system is not corrupt,” he said. “I would love to see a woman in office,” he added. “But I do not want to see Hillary Clinton in office, because she has no honor. ” Should Mr. Sanders drop out, he said, he was prepared to vote for Mr. Trump. Amid chants of “Bernie or Bust” and loud boos as election results rolled in, Alison Bacon, an actress living in Los Angeles, assailed Mrs. Clinton for having proclaimed victory before the Democratic Party had formally bestowed it on her at the convention. “I think it’s absolutely unjust, undemocratic, ” she said. “What kind of example is that setting?” Of course, ending a campaign is always painful, especially one that so consistently defied expectations and openly challenged the political order. From its humble start in April 2015 outside the Capitol in Washington, in a sparsely attended and hurried announcement speech (“We don’t have an endless amount of time,” he warned the gathered reporters, “I have to get back”) Mr. Sanders built a rollicking national movement whose crowds,   and devotion upended the Democratic race. And Mr. Sanders was not merely a candidate to his supporters. With his Everyman appearance and unvarnished anger, he embodied the message that thrilled his followers: that it was time for working Americans to rise up and reclaim a country that was being corrupted by elites and their wealth. “When we began this campaign a little over a year ago, we were considered to be a fringe campaign,’’ Mr. Sanders said on Tuesday, adding wryly: “I think that has changed, just a little bit. ” But even as he acknowledged a “very, very steep fight” to winning his party’s nomination, he did not signal an end for now  —   still electrified, it seemed, by the crowds chanting his name. Howard Dean, a Democrat and a former governor of Vermont, can sympathize. “It’s very hard to concede,” he said. “You are tired. You are cranky. You’ve worked your butt off for two years. ” Nobody, Mr. Dean said, resisted ending a presidential campaign more than he did. Once a     he had a string of setbacks that left him feeling, by February 2004, much as Mr. Sanders does today: furious at an unfair system and determined to fight on. Then Al Gore called. Mr. Dean fulminated, uninterrupted, for 10 minutes, “ranting and raving,” he recalled. But Mr. Gore, schooled in the art of painful concessions, was blunt. “You know, Howard,” he said, “This is not really about you. This is about the country. ” Mr. Dean, taking the advice to heart, quit the campaign a few days later. “The minute he said it,” Mr. Dean recalled, “I looked like an idiot to myself. ” He said he wonders whether Mr. Sanders will heed the warning. “Bernie has changed politics, but his changes are not going to be realized unless he leads  —   and leading is not going to mean tilting at windmills at the convention,” Mr. Dean said. “He has to switch into the mode of a statesman. ” “You don’t get any points for carrying on or complaining about it,” Mr. Dean added. “You get points for sucking it up. ”"
20518,"Obama Endorses Hillary Clinton, and Urges Democrats to Unite - The New York Times",New York Times,Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Jonathan Martin,B,2016-06-10,2016.0,6.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama told Senator Bernie Sanders in an Oval Office meeting on Thursday to channel the energy of his presidential campaign’s millions of supporters behind Hillary Clinton, and said that Mr. Sanders would play a central role in shaping the Democratic agenda if he did. Less than an hour and a half later, Mr. Obama, who had tried to remain neutral in the race between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, formally endorsed her. Moving swiftly to unite his party after a primary campaign that has left many of Mr. Sanders’s supporters bitter and disillusioned, Mr. Obama, according to his aides, tried to mollify the maverick senator while prodding him to reorient his efforts against Mrs. Clinton into a broader bid to help Democrats in November. There was no hint after the meeting that Mr. Sanders intended to challenge Mrs. Clinton for the nomination at next month’s convention, but hours later at a rally in Washington he urged voters there to go to the polls in their primary on Tuesday and to keep pushing for a political revolution. After the White House meeting, Mr. Sanders vowed to take the ideas that have animated his campaign  —   addressing poverty and income inequality, increasing Social Security benefits, and reducing the role of money in politics  —   to the convention. But he also announced plans to meet soon with Mrs. Clinton to discuss ways they could work together to defeat Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The meeting was the set piece of a day of choreographed political theater in which Democrats treated Mr. Sanders to a visit only slightly less elaborate than that of a head of state. The White House made sure that cameras were positioned to capture the president and the vanquished Vermonter strolling animatedly along the White House colonnade to the Oval Office for their meeting. Later, Mr. Sanders met with the Senate Democratic leadership before zooming up Massachusetts Avenue for an audience with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at his residence at the Naval Observatory. Democrats were hoping that if they gave time and space to Mr. Sanders, he would not cause trouble for them at their convention in Philadelphia and would eventually endorse Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Sanders spent much of his day using back entrances and side doors and ducking into stairwells to avoid reporters’ questions, clearly unwilling to talk in precise terms about his plans. The road ahead was clearer for Mrs. Clinton, who on Thursday collected   expressions of support from influential Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, perhaps more of a favorite of the party’s liberals than even Mr. Sanders. In a video posted on her campaign’s Facebook page shortly after Mr. Sanders departed the White House grounds to visit the Capitol, Mr. Obama described Mrs. Clinton as the most qualified candidate to seek the White House, and implored Democrats to come together to elect her after a divisive party primary. “I don’t think there’s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,” Mr. Obama said in the   statement. Mr. Obama has made no secret of his desire to play an active role in the race to succeed him. “I’m with her, I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there to campaign for Hillary,” Mr. Obama said in the video. Mrs. Clinton immediately announced that she and the president would hold their first joint campaign appearance of the 2016 race on Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis. the start of what White House officials said would be an intense campaign push for Mr. Obama that will culminate in   appearances as the November election draws nearer. White House officials had been discussing the endorsement with Mrs. Clinton’s camp for days, but they kept the timing under wraps, in part as a gesture of respect for Mr. Sanders and his highly motivated supporters. Mr. Obama told Mr. Sanders on Sunday that the endorsement would come soon, according to people familiar with the conversation, and discussed the announcement with Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday, the night she clinched the nomination. Mr. Obama recorded the Facebook message earlier on Tuesday at the White House, aides said. The president had been circumspect about declaring the race finished, even after Mrs. Clinton captured sufficient delegates in primaries on Tuesday to clinch the Democratic nomination. On Thursday, he congratulated her on “making history” and said he had personally witnessed her qualifications for the Oval Office. “She’s got the courage, the compassion and the heart to get the job done,” he said. “I have seen her judgment, I’ve seen her toughness, I’ve seen her commitment to our values up close. ” Mr. Obama also praised Mr. Sanders for what he called an “incredible campaign. ” He said the Vermont senator’s emphasis on addressing income inequality, reducing the influence of money in politics and bringing young people into the political process would strengthen the party. In their Oval Office meeting, White House officials said, Mr. Obama told Mr. Sanders that he could play a valuable role in   the party by supporting Democrats in races across the country this year, and use the influence he has amassed in his campaign to press his agenda forward in the Senate. Mr. Sanders, speaking to reporters as he left the West Wing with his wife, Jane, said that “we will continue doing everything that we can to oppose the drift which currently exists toward an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires exercise enormous power over our political, economic and media life. ” “Needless to say,” he added, “I am going to do everything in my power and I will work as hard as I can to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States. ” Mr. Obama’s quick endorsement irritated some of Mr. Sanders’s leading supporters, who said they could not understand why the president would not wait until after next week’s Washington primary, the last contest in the Democratic nominating process, to weigh in. “I thought they’d give him the grace to finish out what he pledged to do, which is take his campaign to the final contest,” said Paul G. Kirk, a former Democratic National Committee chairman and Massachusetts senator who backs Mr. Sanders. At the rally in Washington on Thursday night, Mr. Sanders showed no sign of slowing down his campaign, making no mention of Mrs. Clinton and saying nothing about party unity. Many in the crowd of about 3, 000 people shouted slogans like “Shun the nonbelievers” and “Stay in the race. ” On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders tried to balance their desire to be respectful of Mr. Sanders and give him room to exit the race on his own terms while firmly conveying to him that the contest has essentially ended. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, said he had invited Mr. Sanders to address the Democratic caucus on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton “has enough delegates,” Mr. Reid said after meeting with Mr. Sanders in his Capitol office. “I didn’t hear a single word about him wanting to change the fact that she’s the nominee. ” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who will most likely succeed Mr. Reid as Democratic leader next year, echoed his colleague, telling reporters after his own meeting that he knew Mr. Sanders to be “constructive. ” Privately, Senate leaders breathed a sigh of relief. Mr. Reid told Mr. Sanders during their   conversation that he was entitled to wind down the campaign on his own time. And Mr. Sanders implied to Mr. Reid that he would begin that process after the final primary next week and not take his campaign to the convention floor, according to an aide briefed on the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation. But Mr. Sanders is going to try to put his stamp on a party that he adopted only when he began to seek its nomination. He told Mr. Reid that he wanted a say on both policy and process, an indication that he intends to push for a robustly liberal platform and an overhaul of the Democratic presidential nominating system that could eliminate superdelegates. There are also some personal grudges left over from the primary: Mr. Sanders’s campaign remains uneasy that two prominent Clinton supporters who fiercely attacked him  —   former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut  —   remain   of the D. N. C. ’s Rules Committee. “Of course there are hard feelings,” said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a liberal who is friends with Mr. Sanders but backed Mrs. Clinton. “But Bernie knows she will generally take the party and the country in the right direction  —   and there’s the threat of Trump. ”"
20519,"Hillary Clinton, Tel Aviv, Carbon Dioxide: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",New York Times,Andrea Kannapell and Sandra Stevenson,F,2016-06-10,2016.0,6.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clinton. “I don’t think there’s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,” he said. He earlier secured a pledge from Bernie Sanders to work closely with Mrs. Clinton to unify Democrats against Donald Trump, though no promise to drop out. Senator Elizabeth Warren also backed Mrs. Clinton on Thursday evening and criticized Mr. Trump for his attack on a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel. “You, Donald Trump, are a total disgrace,” Ms. Warren said in a speech to the American Constitution Society. _____ 2. Our analysis of voter data suggests Mr. Trump has a small but real chance of winning even without gains among nonwhite voters. Exit polls from 2012  —   the source of conclusions that the Republicans needed to broaden their appeal  —   obscured the existence of millions of white,   and older voters with limited education. Those are the very voters who tend to support Mr. Trump. _____ 3. A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that the Second Amendment did not guarantee the right to carry concealed weapons. The decision was sharply criticized by the National Rifle Association. But it is in keeping with decisions in other courts, which some analysts say minimizes the likelihood of a Supreme Court review. “This is a huge decision,” an expert in constitutional law said. “This is a major victory for gun control advocates. ” _____ 4. The World Health Organization advised millions of people across Latin America and the Caribbean to delay pregnancy, to avoid having babies with severe brain damage caused by the Zika virus. There is no vaccine against Zika, and efforts to slow its transmission have thus far failed. _____ 5. Politicians, rabbis and government ministers visited a Tel Aviv restaurant district to show solidarity and resolve a day after Palestinian gunmen fatally shot four Israeli civilians there. The terrorist attack, one of the most brazen in months of   Palestinian strikes, prompted Israel to impose controls on Palestinian movements. _____ 6. The San Jose Sharks thwarted Pittsburgh’s plans to hoist the Stanley Cup by hanging on for a   victory on Thursday evening. The Penguins led the Sharks   going into the game, an advantage that no N. H. L. underdog has overcome since 1942. _____ 7. “Warcraft,” the first film to emerge from the   franchise, will be in broad release on Friday. Our reviewer credits the director, Duncan Jones (David Bowie’s son) for imbuing “a Hobbesian war of all against all” with “a little romance and campy winks. ” It’s predictably heavy on cartoonish violence, she says: “Heads pop like grapes and so forth. ” _____ 8. Some symptoms of   stress disorder may have a physical cause. A prominent researcher of brain injuries among military personnel says his team has identified signs of tissue damage caused specifically by explosions. “We talk about PTSD being a psychiatric problem  —   how people responded to the horror of warfare,” said the neuropathologist. “But at least in some cases, no  —   their brain has been damaged. ” _____ 9. One of our   stories today offers a personal journey that illuminates New York City’s history of segregation. Nikole   an investigative journalist who has covered the nation’s struggle over integration, writes about how she and her husband chose to place their daughter in a segregated,   school. “True integration, true equality,” she writes, “requires a surrendering of advantage, and when it comes to our own children, that can feel almost unnatural. ” _____ 10. A law allowing assisted suicide went into effect in California, making it the fourth and by far the largest state to allow the terminally ill to determine the timing of their death. The other three are Oregon, Washington and Vermont. Above, a California woman who has Stage 4 colon cancer and intends to ask for drugs to end her life. _____ 11. Finally, good news: Scientists appear to have made a breakthrough in capturing and storing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. They dissolved the gas with water and pumped it into porous basalt in Iceland, where almost all of it adhered as calcite. It took a surprisingly short time, too  —   just two years. “It’s beyond all our expectations,” said an Icelandic project manager. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

20530,"Donald Trump, Courting Evangelicals, Faults Hillary Clinton’s Policies and Character - The New York Times",New York Times,Ashley Parker,F,2016-06-11,2016.0,6.0,,"Donald J. Trump tried out several lines of attack against Hillary Clinton, at one point calling her “unfit to be president,” as he delivered an otherwise noticeably restrained speech to an audience of evangelical activists here Friday. Appearing before the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference, Mr. Trump promised to “uphold the sanctity and dignity of life” and to “restore respect for people of faith. ” But he also used the opportunity to press his case against Mrs. Clinton, portraying her as arrogant, attacking her economic policies and willingness to admit Syrian refugees into the country and questioning her judgment as secretary of state. “She’ll appoint radical judges who will legislate from the bench, overriding Congress, and I’ll tell you, the will of the people will mean nothing  —   nothing,” Mr. Trump said. “She will undermine the wages of working people with uncontrolled immigration, creating poverty and income insecurity. Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street agenda will crush working families. She’ll put bureaucrats, not parents, in charge of our lives, and our children’s education. ” Referring to Mrs. Clinton’s call for Mr. Obama to take in 65, 000 Syrian refugees, Mr. Trump also challenged her to instead “replace her support for increased refugee admissions” with “a new jobs program for our inner cities. ” “We have to temporarily stop this whole thing with what’s going on with refugees where we don’t know where they come from,” he said, adding: “We have to take a timeout. We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans and work with them so they can come out of this horrible situation that they’re in. ” Mrs. Clinton has been calling Mr. Trump temperamentally unsuited for the White House, and he tried to turn the tables. Mrs. Clinton “refuses to even say the words radical Islam  —   refuses to say it,” Mr. Trump said. “This alone makes her unfit to be president. ” He has vowed to deliver a major speech Monday attacking both Mrs. Clinton and her husband as personally corrupt, and on Friday Mr. Trump asserted that the email scandal that has overshadowed Mrs. Clinton’s campaign for months had its origins in such venality. “Hillary Clinton has jeopardized  —   totally jeopardized  —   national security by putting her emails on a private server, all to hide her corrupt dealings,” he said. The claim appeared to refer to concerns that the private server Mrs. Clinton used as secretary of state may have been more vulnerable to being hacked by foreign adversaries than the State Department’s email system. (Although the emails were supposed to contain only unclassified information, the department has retroactively withheld some of their contents as classified when reviewing them for release in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.) But Mr. Trump offered no backup for his claim that the private server was used to hide “corrupt dealings. ” Noting that President Obama had officially endorsed Mrs. Clinton on Thursday, Mr. Trump added, “First time ever, by the way, a president of the United States endorsed somebody under criminal investigation. ” But that assertion also goes beyond the known facts. The FBI is investigating Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private server, but agents have not yet interviewed her and it is not clear if she herself is a target of a criminal inquiry. A few young protesters interrupted Mr. Trump’s remarks, shouting “Dump Trump” and other slogans. After they were muscled out by security guards, Mr. Trump called them “professional agitators” who were “sent in by the other party  —   believe me. ” Mr. Trump’s speech Friday came as he is battling to regain his footing after weeks of missteps, none more damaging than his questioning whether a federal judge could preside fairly over a case against Trump University because the judge is of Mexican heritage. With party leaders expressing outrage and voicing doubts that he can unify Republicans and defeat Mrs. Clinton in November, Mr. Trump noticeably curbed his impulsiveness Tuesday night, promising in a prepared speech not to let his supporters down. Still, in a Bloomberg Politics podcast published Friday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell raised the possibility of rescinding his endorsement if Mr. Trump did not “change directions. ” Alluding to what he called Mr. Trump’s “obvious shortcomings,” Mr. McConnell said, “It’s pretty obvious he doesn’t know a lot about the issues. ” Before the Faith and Freedom Coalition Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump again stuck mainly to a script, reading from teleprompter screens. But he still   in his characteristically clipped syntax. “We want to uphold the sanctity and dignity of life, marriage and family as the building block of happiness and success,” he said. “And by the way, I know many, many very successful people. The happiest people are the people that have had great religious feel and that  —   incredible marriage, children. It’s more important than the money, folks. Believe me. ” Mr. Trump  —   who has been married three times  —   does not hew to traditional conservative orthodoxy. He previously supported abortion rights, and he said earlier this year that Planned Parenthood has done “some very good work” for millions of women. And in response to North Carolina’s controversial new bathroom law, Mr. Trump said that transgender people should be able to use whatever bathroom where they feel most comfortable. But he nonetheless won the early endorsement of leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr. president of Liberty University, and successfully wooed evangelical voters during the primary, exit polls showed. Hogan Gidley, a former aide to Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, said that while evangelicals “would love to have a true evangelical in the White House,” they understood that Republicans required a broader coalition to win in November. “Republicans cannot win without getting evangelicals, and they can’t win only getting evangelicals,” Mr. Gidley said. “They have to expand the voter universe and so far, Trump has done an amazing job with that. ”"
20551,Bernie Sanders Refuses to Concede Nomination to Hillary Clinton - The New York Times,New York Times,Yamiche Alcindor,F,2016-06-13,2016.0,6.0,,"Senator Bernie Sanders said on Sunday that he would “take our campaign for transforming the Democratic Party into the convention,” refusing to concede the presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton though not explicitly saying he would challenge her for it. Mrs. Clinton earned enough delegates to clinch the nomination last week, but Mr. Sanders has declined to end his campaign. He has contended that he could persuade enough superdelegates, the party leaders who have overwhelmingly backed Mrs. Clinton, to switch their support to him by arguing that he would be the stronger candidate against Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. That plan became more improbable last week as   Democrats supported Mrs. Clinton. President Obama endorsed her on Thursday, calling her the most qualified candidate ever to seek the White House and imploring Democrats to unite behind her. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the only senator to endorse Mr. Sanders, told CNN on Friday that he now supports Mrs. Clinton. In recent days, Mr. Sanders appeared to acknowledge the odds against him, and began speaking less about beating Mrs. Clinton and more about working to defeat Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. On Sunday, he gathered with about 20 key supporters and advisers at his home in Burlington, Vt. to discuss how to proceed. “We are going to take our campaign to the convention with the full understanding that we are very good at arithmetic and that we know, you know, who has the received the most votes up to now,” Mr. Sanders said after the meeting, standing on his front lawn with his wife, Jane. Among the dozen or so people who attended the gathering were Benjamin T. Jealous, a former president of the N. A. A. C. P. Congressman Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and Bill McKibben, the environmentalist and author. Notably, Mr. Sanders also said he would continue his efforts aimed at “transforming the Democratic Party,” a sign that his main goal may no longer be to become the nominee. Besides defeating Mr. Trump, advisers say his focus is to get his ideas, like universal health care and free public college, reflected in the party platform. Refusing to concede and release his delegates to vote for Mrs. Clinton could be a negotiating tactic for winning concessions on the platform. If his delegates tried to nominate Mr. Sanders from the floor of the convention next month, the scene could damage Mrs. Clinton at a time she is trying to project strength and party unity. In recent days, it had been unclear whether Mr. Sanders intended to stay in the race, and even on Sunday he did not rule out the possibility that he would formally concede the nomination in the coming days. After he met with Mr. Obama on Thursday he said he looked forward to exploring how he could work with Mrs. Clinton “to defeat Donald Trump and to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent. ” Then he held a rally that night in Washington urging voters to cast ballots for him on Tuesday in the nation’s final primary. When asked by Chuck Todd on Sunday’s “Meet the Press” on NBC whether he was an “active candidate,” he responded that he wanted to see Mr. Trump defeated. Mr. Sanders said that he and Mrs. Clinton planned to meet on Tuesday and that he would ask her “whether she will be vigorous in standing up for working families in the middle class, moving aggressively in climate change, health care for all, making public colleges and universities  . ” “And after we have that kind of discussion and after we can determine whether or not we are going to have a strong and progressive platform,” he said, “I will be able to make other decisions. ” There have been signs that he was winding down his run. While Mrs. Clinton has been hiring campaign workers, Mr. Sanders started laying off at least half of his campaign staff members last week. He has let go of a number of advance staff members who help with campaign logistics, as well as field workers who have been canvassing for votes. According to a person who attended the meeting at Mr. Sanders’s home Sunday, and who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private gathering, there was no talk from Mr. Sanders about trying to win the nomination. The group was keenly interested in how the senator’s meeting with Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday will turn out, and whether he would get assurances that she would fight for his ideas, this person said. While he is effectively no longer a threat, Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats are counting on Mr. Sanders to eventually get behind her candidacy. He has a loyal base of more than 10 million voters and an enormous donor list that Mrs. Clinton will want to tap into. Some of his supporters say they will not vote for anyone but Mr. Sanders, so Mrs. Clinton’s success may depend on how vocally the senator supports her."
20565,Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s Speeches: What You Missed - The New York Times,New York Times,Nick Corasaniti and Matt Flegenheimer,M,2016-06-14,2016.0,6.0,,"Donald J. Trump addressed the massacre in Orlando, Fla. on Monday, one day after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, as part of a broader national security speech in Manchester, N. H. where he  also contrasted himself with Hillary Clinton. Here are the highlights from Mr. Trump’s speech: • Mr. Trump began his remarks saying he initially planned to focus on Hillary Clinton, “and all of the bad things and we all know what’s going on,” adding “especially how poor she’d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism. ” He promised that speech would come “very, very soon. ” • Mr. Trump called for a moment of silence for the dead in Orlando, saying it was an attack against people and “an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety. ” He continued, “We need to respond to this attack in America as one united people. ” • As his first policy proposal if elected president, Mr. Trump reiterated his plan to temporarily ban Muslim immigration. He said in particular that he would ban immigration from countries where terrorism was a threat. He said, referring to the assailant in Orlando, that “thousands and thousands of people, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer” are pouring into the country, and that the ban “will be lifted when and as a nation we are in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country. ” • Even though he said at the top of his speech that it would not be about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump criticized his likely opponent for her foreign policy, again sowing some conspiratorial bent on Mrs. Clinton’s grasp of the terror threat: “She has no clue in my opinion what radical Islam is, and she won’t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know. ” He quickly pivoted his criticism of Mrs. Clinton to the debate over gun laws, falsely saying she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, “leaving only the bad guys, terrorists with guns. ” He added: “Not gonna happen. ” • Mr. Trump repeatedly framed the threat of terrorism in the realm of immigration, claiming that there were “hundreds of thousands” of Muslim immigrants who are coming into the United States unscreened. (The United States does indeed have a screening process.) • Mr. Trump referred to himself as a better friend of women and the L. G. B. T. community than Hillary Clinton, referring to his immigration ban against Muslim immigrants as one against people “who reject our values. ” While it was notable how far Mr. Trump went in his efforts to embrace the L. G. B. T. community, often using inclusive pronouns like “our” and “we,” he remains opposed to   marriage. • Making blanket statements against an entire religion, Mr. Trump said that the Muslim community “know what’s going on” regarding terrorism, despite no evidence of that in the Orlando killings. He said the Muslim community had “to work with us. ” He added: “They knew the person in San Bernardino was bad. They have to turn them in. ” He was referring to the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. last December when a Muslim couple shot and killed 14 people and wounded 22. • Mr. Trump concluded his remarks with a promise, if he were to be elected president, for a “safe society,” and he riffed on his campaign slogan: “We will make America rich again. We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. ” _____ Hillary Clinton  addressed the massacre in Orlando on Monday, during a speech in Cleveland where she outlined her broader plans to combat terrorism. Here are the highlights from Mrs. Clinton’s speech: • Mrs. Clinton, invoking a “nightmare that’s become   familiar,” said it was “not a day for politics. ” The shooter may be dead, she said, “but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. ” • Mrs. Clinton said that despite some progress in combating Islamic State forces on the ground in Iraq and Syria, the group would “seek to stage more attacks” wherever it could. She pledged to make the targeting of “lone wolves” a top priority as president. • Noting that the shooter in Orlando, Fla. had been on the F. B. I. ’s radar, Mrs. Clinton said the country required “more resources for this fight” and called for the removal of “weapons of war” from the streets. • Mrs. Clinton, noting the acrimonious national debate over guns, said everyone should be able to agree that “If the F. B. I. is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn’t be able to just go buy a gun. ” • Mrs. Clinton said it was “long past time” for the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait to stop allowing their citizens to finance extremists. • Mrs. Clinton, observing that the shooting targeted a gay nightclub, said that “an attack on any American is an attack on all Americans. ” Addressing gay Americans, she said, “You have millions of allies who will always have your back. And I am one of them. ” • Seeking to contrast her approach with the   impulses of Donald J. Trump, Mrs. Clinton said America was “not a land of winners and losers,” calling it “a country of ‘we,’ not ‘me. ’” • Mrs. Clinton called to mind the sense of national unity after the Sept. 11 attacks, reminding voters that President George W. Bush quickly “sent a message of unity and solidarity” to Muslims. “It is time to get back to the spirit of those days,” she said, “the spirit of  . ”"
20582,Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Meet as Their Battle Ends - The New York Times,New York Times,Yamiche Alcindor and Patrick Healy,B,2016-11-29,2016.0,11.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   With little affection or trust between them, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders met privately for nearly two hours on Tuesday night to size each other up as they started exploring what kind of alliance they might build for the general election battle against Donald J. Trump. Yet Mr. Sanders chose to withhold his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, several Sanders advisers said, because he wants her to take steps to win his confidence before the Democratic convention, where his supporters expect him to speak and Clinton advisers hope he will give her his   backing. Aides to Mrs. Clinton said she had never expected his endorsement Tuesday night. A statement from the Clinton campaign after the meeting described it as “a positive discussion about their primary campaign, about unifying the party and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation. ” They discussed issues like raising wages and reducing college costs, and “agreed to continue working on their shared agenda, including through the platform development process for the upcoming Democratic National Convention. ” The Sanders campaign released a nearly identical statement, though it emphasized that the two candidates also spoke about “how best to bring more people into the political process”  —   a reflection of the strong support for Mr. Sanders among young people and independents. Neither Democrat entered the meeting on sure footing, and both were a little tense, advisers in each camp said beforehand. At the end, they left the Capital Hilton through separate exits without speaking to the roughly two dozen reporters gathered there. Mrs. Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee last week, spent the meeting trying to deduce what it would take to earn Mr. Sanders’s endorsement and whether he would seek policy concessions or political promises, several advisers said. Mr. Sanders focused on gauging the depth of Mrs. Clinton’s commitment to progressive goals like a higher minimum wage and lower financial burdens on college students, and to making the Democratic nomination process more open in the future. The chemistry between the two candidates was strained, in part, because Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders had not had any real chances to air grievances or blow off steam with each other away from the television cameras during their   fight for the nomination. Mrs. Clinton had a few such moments with Barack Obama before they sat down for their own      in 2008, which made it a little easier for them to come together, unite their party and win that November. In a sign that they are still adjusting to each other, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders were joined in their meeting by Jane Sanders, Mr. Sanders’s wife Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman and Robby Mook, her campaign manager. Two advisers to Mr. Sanders said he thought Mrs. Clinton had said many of the right things at the meeting, but described him as concerned that she might embrace more politically moderate positions later if she thinks it necessary to win states like Florida, Ohio and Virginia. The advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the campaign had not authorized them to speak, said Mr. Sanders felt no pressure to endorse Mrs. Clinton quickly. And he has leverage: He accrued about 12 million votes and nearly 1, 900 delegates, and in a New York   News poll last month, 28 percent of his supporters said they would not vote for Mrs. Clinton if she was the Democratic nominee. Mrs. Clinton picked up nearly 16 million votes and 2, 800 delegates. Whether Mr. Sanders endorses her enthusiastically and campaigns for her, or recognizes her as the nominee but otherwise withholds his blessing, is a significant concern for some Clinton advisers. Others in her campaign think that Democrats will ultimately unite because the possibility of a Trump victory is too great to ignore. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders met on the day of the Democratic primary in Washington, D. C. the final contest of the nominating process. Mrs. Clinton won 79 percent of the vote. Mr. Sanders received a standing ovation when he dropped in at the Senate Democrats’ weekly lunch to speak about his campaign and pose for an official Senate photo with his colleagues. He has not been in the Capitol much of late according to his website, he has not cast a vote since Jan. 12. “It was very upbeat, very optimistic,” said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan."
20662,"Hillary Clinton’s Message: Yes, the Economy Is Messed Up. But I Can Fix It. - The New York Times",New York Times,Neil Irwin,M,2016-06-23,2016.0,6.0,,"It has been a year dominated by populist rage, embodied in Bernie Sanders’s calls for a political revolution and Donald J. Trump’s angry assertions that the United States, and its workers, are losing badly in the global economy. In an economic policy speech on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton gave this message: I alone am the candidate who knows how to turn those underlying frustrations into actual policies that might make things better. She offered herself as someone who would not merely vent voters’ anger, but respond to that anger by pulling the levers of the federal bureaucracy and creating legislation that can be scored by the Congressional Budget Office and just maybe pass a Senate committee. “It’s not easy to change Washington, or how corporations behave,” Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said before exuberant supporters in Raleigh, N. C. a day after a speech blasting Mr. Trump’s business record, ethics and   policy positions. “It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan. It takes a plan, and it takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results. ” Unlike her primary opponent, Mr. Sanders, she did not promise to provide free college tuition or to break up major banks she instead said she would make sure students could graduate without a debt hangover, and clamp down on banks in ways that would probably lead them to shrink. Unlike her Republican opponent, Mr. Trump, she did not propose ripping up trade deals and risking trade wars with the likes of China and Mexico. But she did say her administration would use the tax code to punish companies that outsource jobs. Notably, she also did not proclaim the greatness of the   economy and pledge continuity. That was a contrast with two other   candidates who ran to succeed a   president from their party amid a strong economy, Al Gore in 2000 and George H. W. Bush in 1988. This carefully   speech suggests she seeks to run not by boasting of what has gone right in the economy under President Obama, but as a fixer who can more successfully deal with the things that are still broken. The Obama administration has stressed that   job growth has been strong for the last several years and that the unemployment rate is now down to 4. 7 percent. But in her speech, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the   divergence between worker productivity and wages, the tendency of companies to view employee compensation as a cost to be minimized. And she spoke of the struggles of the   unemployed, people who can find only   work, and those who are out of the labor force entirely. In effect, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the underlying economic discontent that has fueled the rise of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, while presenting herself as the person best qualified to address it. “The bottom line is that too many leaders in business and government have lost sight of our shared responsibility to each other and to our nation,” she said. “They let Wall Street take big risks with unregulated financial activities, they skew our tax code toward the wealthy, they failed to enforce our trade rules, they undermined workers’ rights. ” Mrs. Clinton thus emphasized policies that have potential for deal making even in a polarized Congress, or that could be executed through administrative action. In the first category, she mentioned   investment in public infrastructure, funding   investments in the nation’s future with a mix of public and private resources. Business interests and many elected Republicans support ideas in this vein, at least in theory. She also mentioned immigration reform as a tool for economic improvement, another idea that businesspeople and many Republicans support. (Recall that an immigration bill created in part by Marco Rubio, who in a slightly different universe might be Mrs. Clinton’s   opponent, was one vote in the House of Representatives away from becoming law not long ago.) In the category of administrative action, Mrs. Clinton was vague but clear about her intention to use the machinery of government to nudge things in workers’ favor. She said she would “continue to crack down on wage theft” and abuse of overtime rules, suggesting that she would, if anything, seek to expand Obama administration rules to make more workers eligible for     pay and use government authority to fight employers that try to shortchange employees. The policy steps she described had mostly been put forward by her campaign already, so it is hard to describe the speech as a step toward the left, in hopes of corralling Sanders voters, or to the center, in hopes of broadening her appeal to the general electorate. Rather, the speech framed her place in the race as being the candidate who understands the populist discontent but will react to it with practicality. That carries risks, too. After all, President Obama has spent his entire second term following the same basic strategy of looking for lanes for bipartisan cooperation on things like infrastructure spending and immigration overhaul, while using the federal bureaucracy to try to tilt the playing field toward workers within the confines of current law. As the election advances, Mrs. Clinton will be vulnerable to the charge that she is promising to do the same things as Mr. Obama has, but with the hope of getting better results for American workers. Politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Mrs. Clinton’s message on Wednesday was that she will campaign and govern with a   plan, drawn up by   experts, incorporating the full range of potential legislative and administrative tools available to the next president."

The Supreme Court, still missing a ninth justice, handed down two momentous decisions. One was a   deadlock that kept President Obama’s signature immigration plan on ice, a blow to his hopes to shield millions from deportation. The second upheld affirmative action in admissions at the University of Texas at Austin. Here’s a guide explaining both rulings. _____ 3. In Washington, a   Democrat   in the House brought institutional disruption, a hallmark of national politics, to the heart of the legislature. But it failed to persuade the Republican leadership to agree to vote on gun control measures. Speaker Paul Ryan dismissed it as “a publicity stunt. ” Before Congress recessed for a week, the Senate voted to keep a compromise gun control bill alive, but in procedural limbo. _____ 4. The fracas turned into a watershed moment. Protesting Democrats reached out to constituents on social media after Mr. Ryan adjourned the session, cutting off  ’s video feed.   pivoted, picking up the live video the representatives were shooting on Periscope, Facebook Live and the like. “For one day and night,” our TV critic writes, “the hottest drama on cable was on  . ” _____ 5. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both weighed in on the Supreme Court’s immigration ruling. He praised it and she called it “heartbreaking. ” Mr. Trump was in Scotland, taking a campaign break that some strategists called   to attend the reopening of one of his golf courses. The campaign manager he fired this week, Corey Lewandowski, joined CNN as a political commentator. _____ 6. “Stairway to Heaven” is safe  —   or rather the pockets of Jimmy Page and Robert Plant will not be emptied of millions of dollars. A jury in Los Angeles ruled that Led Zeppelin did not steal the opening riff from a 1968 song by a band it crossed paths with early in its career. “I didn’t remember it then, and I don’t remember it now,” Mr. Plant testified. _____ 7. The Justice Department made a major move against mass incarceration, a phenomenon that has deepened tensions in the national debate over racial inequities, law enforcement and justice. A landmark agreement in Mississippi means that, for the first time, a local government must provide services to shrink jailings. Those include diversion programs,   services and barring incarceration for some failures to pay   fines. _____ 8. In Baltimore, protesters chanted “Freddie Gray should be here with us today” after a police officer was acquitted of all charges in Mr. Gray’s death. The officer, Caesar Goodson, above, drove the van in which Mr. Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury. The judge said prosecutors had not proved that Mr. Goodson had given or intended to give Mr. Gray a “rough ride,” making it the third trial in the case to end without a conviction. _____ 9.

20699,‘Brexit’ Revolt Casts a Shadow Over Hillary Clinton’s Cautious Path - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy,M,2016-09-23,2016.0,9.0,,"For Hillary Clinton, Britain’s emotionally charged uprising against the European Union is the sort of populist victory over establishment politics that she fears in the coming presidential election. Mrs. Clinton shares more with the defeated “Remain” campaign than a similar slogan  —   her “Stronger Together” echoing its “Stronger In. ” Her fundamental argument, much akin to Prime Minister David Cameron’s against British withdrawal from the European Union, is that Americans should value stability and incremental change over the risks entailed in radical change and the possibility of chaos if Donald J. Trump wins the presidency. She offers reasonableness instead of resentment, urging voters to see the big picture and promising to manage economic and immigration upheaval, just as Mr. Cameron did. She, too, is a pragmatic internationalist battling against nationalist anger, cautioning that the turmoil after the   Brexit vote underscores a need for “calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House. ” But prudence is cold comfort to people fed up with    . According to their friends and advisers, Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton have worried for months that she was out of sync with the mood of the electorate, and that her politically safe messages  —   like “I’m a progressive who gets results”  —   were far less compelling to frustrated voters than the “political revolution” of Senator Bernie Sanders or Mr. Trump’s   promise to “Make America Great Again. ” Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump won a combined 25 million votes during the primary season, compared with 16 million for Mrs. Clinton. And while many of Mr. Sanders’s supporters are expected to support her in November, she has not recalibrated her message to try to tap into the anger that he and Mr. Trump channeled. Nor does Mrs. Clinton have any plans, advisers say, to take cues from the Brexit campaign and start   her support for globalized markets, or denouncing porous borders, illegal immigrants and the lack of job protections in   agreements. Much distinguishes the presidential contest from the British fight, of course, including a    matchup between   candidates, a sharply different economic context, and a long and proud history of immigration. Yet in addition to worrying that she is out of step, Mrs. Clinton is somewhat hemmed in by her record: She supported her husband’s North American Free Trade Agreement, which caused significant economic pain in the industrial Midwest after it went into effect in 1994. And her nuanced views about free trade are a harder sell to many voters than Mr. Trump’s   vows to trash bad trade deals and use tariffs as economic weapons of national defense. While Mrs. Clinton is counting on Mr. Trump’s history of racist and sexist remarks to doom his candidacy, Thursday’s Brexit referendum was an unnerving reminder that voter anger is deeper and broader than many elite politicians and veteran pollsters realize. In swing states like Ohio, many Democrats and Republicans yearn for an economic comeback and are not confident that Mrs. Clinton understands their frustrations or has the ideas and wherewithal to deliver the sort of change that could satisfy them. “Brexit is clearly a cautionary tale for the Clinton campaign not to get too complacent with a potential victory,” said David B. Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Akron. “Trump, Sanders and those in Great Britain who ran the Leave campaign are tapping into an anger and anxiety that is clearly festering.   folks in the United States are similar to   folks in Europe. And a lot of those   people feel as if the international economic system is not working for them and strangling the middle class. ” Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist, said the British vote was the clearest sign yet that “the intensity against the status quo is far more real than many are still willing to acknowledge. ” “If the Trump victory in the primary wasn’t enough of one, the Brexit vote serves as a major   call indicating just how frustrated average voters are with those in power,” Mr. DuHaime said. Several Democrats cautioned against drawing too many lessons from the Brexit vote, saying mass immigration and economic malaise were bigger problems in Britain and the European Union than in the United States. They also said many British voters were revolting against a bureaucracy in Brussels that they regarded as bloated, overpaid and prone to interfering in the affairs of sovereign countries. Yet the Democrats acknowledged that the worldview held by Mrs. Clinton and many of the party’s elites was not as attractive to many voters as it once was. “Liberal internationalism seems to have been dying for a while,” said Mark S. Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is not involved with the Clinton campaign. “But while that may be the animating philosophy of foreign policy intellectuals the world over, it is not the animating philosophy of America, nor of our domestic politics. ” For Sean Harrington, a husband and father of three who owns the Town Pump Tavern in downtown Detroit, the support for   deals and international markets cannot die fast enough. Taking a break from his bookkeeping duties on Friday, he said President Clinton’s economic policies were still “ruining the economy” by giving benefits to large corporations that move jobs overseas, while in states like Michigan, “the average work force loses. ” “If my fellow Americans were doing better, there would be more money around and traded in and out of my pockets,” said Mr. Harrington, a registered independent who is undecided between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton regularly pledges to “make sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top,” as she put it on Wednesday in Raleigh, N. C. where she also promised to reject “bad trade deals and unfair trade practices. ” She also argued in favor of Britain’s remaining in the European Union. But she was not surprised that the “Leave” campaign won, her advisers said Friday, because she understands the extent of voter anger. Her advisers said they were confident the referendum in Britain did not mirror the presidential election in the United States. “These are two different countries, with very different circumstances and demographics, facing different choices,” said Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton’s communications director. “We believe American voters are looking for concrete solutions to address their economic frustrations and unlikely to find the turmoil, economic uncertainty and roiling of markets caused by the Brexit vote particularly appealing. ” Frank Luntz, a Republican expert on political messaging, said Mr. Cameron and the “Remain” camp had failed to “personalize, individualize or humanize their campaign. ” The “Stronger Together” slogan shared by the “Remain” campaign and Mrs. Clinton feels bloodless and overly intellectual compared with the more emotional,   appeals of Mr. Trump and the “Leave” movement, he said. “The problem with the concept of ‘together’ is that it promotes groupthink rather than individual pursuits,” Mr. Luntz said. “We are in an age of individual action, not collective responsibility. ” Mrs. Clinton’s arguments against Mr. Trump often require a great deal of explanation to voters, which can sometimes turn them off. While Mr. Trump thrills his audiences with big promises  —   without saying much about how he would fulfill them  —   Mrs. Clinton can get caught in the gears of policy. One recent exception was a foreign policy speech in early June, when she hit a rhythm and ripped into Mr. Trump with memorable lines like “He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia. ” But when Mrs. Clinton takes pains to explain why Mr. Trump’s promises and policies do not add up, or are too risky, she runs a risk of her own: that she will sound as though she is instructing or talking down to her audience. Not many voters want a lecturer as president. “A slogan and a message must be aspirational  —   either give people hope things will get better or that the bad stuff will stop  —   both,” said Ruth Sherman, a political communications analyst who is not affiliated with any campaign. Referring to one of Mrs. Clinton’s taglines, she said: “Hillary’s ‘I’m with her’  —   I remember thinking when I first saw it, ‘Really?’ It’s not my job to be with her. She should be with me. ” If Mr. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” is resonant  —   “by far the best slogan of all the candidates,” Ms. Sherman said  —   Mrs. Clinton is counting on voters to appreciate policy ideas that are more strategic than  . She argued in Raleigh, for instance, that markets like the European Union “work best when all the stakeholders share in the benefits. ” While that statement was hardly in the aspirational vein that Ms. Sherman recommends, it set a clear goal and was less divisive than Mr. Trump’s comments on the British referendum. The American electorate has tilted this year toward presidential candidates who make them feel as much as think, but Mrs. Clinton and her allies hope that voters will reflect on the vote in Britain and opt for the steadiness and predictability that she promises. “I don’t think the average American who has a retirement account right now is thrilled about Donald Trump’s support of Brexit,” said Thomas R. Nides, who was a deputy secretary of state under Mrs. Clinton. “Hillary Clinton understands we always need to change  —   but change that doesn’t cause unintended consequences for the average American. ”"
20733,Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren Take Aim at Donald Trump - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-06-28,2016.0,6.0,,"CINCINNATI  —   They stormed the stage together wearing similarly colored clothes  —   hues that almost perfectly matched the bold blue of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign logo. With a “Stronger Together” sign hanging in the background and a Katy Perry pop song blaring from the speakers, they cheered each other on like old pals, cracking jokes about Donald J. Trump and pointing with enthusiasm at a young supporter who waved a placard that read “Girl Power. ” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a towering political figure among today’s liberal Democrats, brought her energy, folksy appeal and populist roar to a candidate not known for energizing crowds. For Ms. Warren, the joint event with Mrs. Clinton here on Monday, the first time the two Democrats campaigned onstage together, was a moment for her to elevate her profile as the liberal voice of the party and a favorite to be vice president. For Mrs. Clinton, it was a chance to woo the party’s liberal wing and convince economically   voters that she, too, is a populist champion running for president to improve their lives. “I got into this race because I wanted to even the odds for people who have the odds stacked against them,” Mrs. Clinton told the crowd. “To build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, we have got to go big and we have got to go bold. ” Mrs. Clinton stood onstage grinning and nodding, her hands clasped calmly at her waist, as Ms. Warren eviscerated Mr. Trump in remarks that lasted roughly half as long as Mrs. Clinton’s   address. Ms. Warren told an electrified crowd of roughly 2, 600 gathered in the grand corridor of the Cincinnati Museum Center, under murals of factory and farmworkers, that the presumptive Republican nominee would “crush you into the dirt to get whatever he wants. ” And when Ms. Warren, a onetime critic of Mrs. Clinton, turned from the lectern to face the presumptive Democratic nominee, declaring that she “has never backed down” from fighting for the middle class, Mrs. Clinton flashed a wide, satisfied smile, appearing to let out a sigh of relief that she had the liberal senator from Massachusetts in her corner. She mouthed two simple words to her supercharged surrogate: “Thank you. ” The event was the culmination of warming relations between Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Warren, who has criticized the financial policies of the Bill Clinton era. Before she was a senator, Ms. Warren turned her ire on Mrs. Clinton, then a New York senator, for shifting her position to support bankruptcy legislation that would have made it more difficult for families to get debt relief. Those differences seemed a distant memory on Monday as Mrs. Clinton struck an almost identical tone and praised Ms. Warren’s   in the Senate. “Some of the best TV since Elizabeth came to the Senate is on ” Mrs. Clinton said. “Whenever you see her pressing a bank executive or a regulator for answers,” she continued. “Remember: She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up. ” Both women framed their remarks on Monday by portraying Mr. Trump as a selfish corporate titan whose business record has not benefited American workers. Mrs. Clinton reeled off a list of   Trump enterprises. “Trump suits were made in Mexico,” she said. “Trump furniture is made in Turkey, instead of Cleveland. Trump barware is made in Slovenia, instead of Toledo. ” Living up to her newfound reputation as Trump    Ms. Warren roused the crowd with stinging criticism of the Manhattan businessman. But she also appeared cautious not to overshadow her party’s presumptive nominee, looking back at Mrs. Clinton occasionally as she spoke, as if in deference to an elder. “Donald Trump says he’ll make America great again,” Ms. Warren said, calling his slogan “goofy,” a take on Mr. Trump’s favorite insult for the Massachusetts senator. “I ask, for who exactly? For families that don’t fly to Scotland to play golf?” In response, Mr. Trump’s campaign called Ms. Warren a “sellout” for supporting Mrs. Clinton, pointing to the presumptive Democratic nominee’s Wall Street donors. In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Trump called Ms. Warren a “racist” and “a total fraud. ” Many in the crowd viewed the joint event as a practice run for what could transpire should Mrs. Clinton select Ms. Warren as her running mate. While an   ticket is unlikely, James Hamilton, the Washington lawyer leading Mrs. Clinton’s   search, has begun vetting Ms. Warren and other candidates. Ever since she endorsed Mrs. Clinton this month, Ms. Warren has been a powerful surrogate, attacking Mr. Trump in spades and visiting the Clinton campaign’s headquarters in Brooklyn to encourage young staff members with a simple message: “Don’t screw this up!” If Ms. Warren’s liberal policy positions could make it difficult for her to get a place on a ticket, on Monday she and Mrs. Clinton seemed to have little daylight between them as they each vowed to restructure the American economy to help the middle class. In an address that spoke to the “frustration, the fear, the anxiety and, yes, the anger” over an economy in which the wealthiest Americans have thrived as   wages have remained virtually stagnant, Mrs. Clinton hit the same themes that elevated Ms. Warren in the Senate and fueled the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the   Democratic nominating contest. In a season defined by anger over globalization and economic inequality, Mrs. Clinton firmly declared that “this is not a time for half measures” as she laid out her   plan to lift wages and create jobs. In Ohio, a battleground state, Mrs. Clinton delivered a promise to strengthen labor unions, close loopholes that give tax breaks to corporations for moving jobs overseas, raise the minimum wage and make college affordable. “Why do the richest Americans and biggest corporations get away with manipulating the tax code so they pay lower rates than you do?” Mrs. Clinton asked to boos from the crowd. With Mr. Sanders not yet ready to campaign for his primary opponent (while acknowledging he would vote for her to defeat Mr. Trump) Mrs. Clinton’s rally with Ms. Warren could help her continue to win over the liberal voters who had flocked to Mr. Sanders’s message. Some 45 percent of Mr. Sanders’s supporters now have a positive view of Mrs. Clinton, according to an NBC   Street Journal poll. Both Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Warren seemed to relish criticizing Mr. Trump’s response to Britain’s momentous decision on Thursday to leave the European Union, which has jolted global financial markets and caused the British pound to tumble to its lowest level since 1985. On a trip to visit his Turnberry golf course in Scotland last week, Mr. Trump declared Thursday’s vote “a great thing” and drew parallels between the rise of populist anger in Britain and voters’ sentiments in the United States. “Basically, they took their country back,” Mr. Trump said, adding that a cheaper British pound would help his golf course business. “Donald Trump cheered on Britain’s current crisis, which has sucked millions of dollars out of your retirement accounts, because, he said, it might bring more rich people to his new golf course,” Ms. Warren said."
20817,Shadow of Plea Deal for David Petraeus Loomed Over Hillary Clinton Email Case - The New York Times,New York Times,Eric Lichtblau,M,2016-07-06,2016.0,7.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   As F. B. I. lawyers weighed whether to recommend criminal charges over Hillary Clinton’s private email server, one recent controversy loomed large over their decision: the plea deal reached last year by David H. Petraeus, the retired   general and C. I. A. director, for giving highly classified information to a woman with whom he had an affair. James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, said Tuesday that in assessing the Clinton case and looking at past cases on the handling of classified information, “we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. ” He did not mention Mr. Petraeus by name, but Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials were known to be deeply upset by the Justice Department’s willingness to let Mr. Petraeus plead to a misdemeanor charge in the case. That decision complicated the Clinton investigation enormously for the F. B. I. because the case against Mrs. Clinton appeared much weaker to them than the case against Mr. Petraeus. In the Petraeus case, the retired general acknowledged in a taped interview that he knew that some of the “black book” journals he gave to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, for a book she was writing were “highly classified,” according to court documents. He then lied to F. B. I. investigators, denying that he gave her any classified information. In contrast, Mr. Comey said in the Clinton case that “we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information. ” Mr. Comey and the F. B. I. had pushed for felony charges against Mr. Petraeus for mishandling classified information and then lying about it. But Eric H. Holder Jr. then the attorney general, overruled Mr. Comey and reduced the charge to a misdemeanor, sparing Mr. Petraeus any jail time. While one case does not serve as binding precedent for the next, prosecutors and F. B. I. agents said that Mr. Petraeus’s sentence made it harder to argue that Ms. Clinton should face charges, barring some new revelation."
20819,"Hillary Clinton, Wimbledon, NASA: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",New York Times,Andrea Kannapell and Sandra Stevenson,F,2016-07-06,2016.0,7.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The F. B. I. director, James Comey, said the bureau would not recommend criminal charges over Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. That lifted a legal cloud hanging over her campaign. But, in keeping with a long career of diving into thorny political conflicts, he rebuked Mrs. Clinton for being “extremely careless” and the State Department for lax security. He noted that hostile governments might have gained access to her personal account. Some of Mrs. Clinton’s aides could still be punished, potentially costing them security clearances in a Clinton administration. _____ 2. President Obama made his first campaign appearance alongside Mrs. Clinton in North Carolina, just hours after Mr. Comey spoke. “I can tell you this, Hillary Clinton has been tested,” the president said. “There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office. ” _____ 3. Britain’s pound hit a   low against the dollar as concerns over the country’s exit from the European Union mount. Theresa May, Britain’s home secretary, has emerged as the   for prime minister, to replace David Cameron. One lawmaker has called her “a bloody difficult woman. ” Even the art world is trying to grapple with the seismic shift, although one writer said the news itself was “playing out as a fascinating, twisting narrative. ” _____ 4. NASA’s Juno spacecraft completed a   voyage and has begun 20 months of orbits around Jupiter to collect data and images. The planet, most likely the first formed after the sun, could hold the keys to understanding the origins of the solar system. “Now the fun begins,” the lead scientist on the project said. _____ 5. PBS fended off fireworks from viewers after admitting that its broadcast of the Independence Day Show from the National Mall in Washington tried to compensate for   visibility problems by intercutting footage of pyrotechnics from previous years. The channel tweeted that its choice was “the patriotic thing to do,” but a Washington Post reporter tweeted back, “the Milli Vanilli of fireworks #shame. ” _____ 6. Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer is not as random as many people believe. Our health columnist, a doctor, reviewed cancer studies and concluded that attention to diet and exercise, and avoiding smoking, can significantly lower our vulnerability. One study showed that less than 30 percent of the lifetime risk of getting cancer was because of intrinsic risk factors, or “bad luck. ” _____ 7. A French parliamentary panel found widespread intelligence failures connected to the terrorist attacks in Paris last year. Taking a page from the U. S. after the   attacks, the panel urged that the nation’s intelligence agencies be merged. “Today we don’t measure up to those who are attacking us,” a lawmaker said. _____ 8. This Palestinian doctor, pictured with his family, has become a cause célèbre in Israel after helping save the lives of Jewish settlers in the West Bank. He happened upon an overturned car and helped treat the injured. A Palestinian medic had to warn him to flee to avoid being set upon by other settlers who might have mistaken him for the gunman who fired on the car. _____ 9. Venus Williams advanced at Wimbledon, reaching a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2010 United States Open. “I don’t have any regrets about anything that’s taken place in between,” she said, referring to troubles, including a diagnosis of an   disease and a back injury. “It’s been a journey, but it’s made me stronger. ” Her sister, Serena, is also in the semifinals. _____ 10. Finally, one of our   pieces today taps into the confusion over what we should be eating. Nutritionists and ordinary Americans tend to agree that soda and bacon aren’t so good for you, and that kale and fresh fruit are. But the experts rate sushi and tofu high, while the public elevates granola bars and orange juice. Both sides have mixed feelings about popcorn, pork chops and whole milk.

20828,"On Hillary Clinton’s Rough Day, Republicans Rue Missed Chance - The New York Times",New York Times,Jonathan Martin,M,2016-07-07,2016.0,7.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   As the Republican strategist Brian Walsh watched the nonstop cable news coverage Tuesday from his K Street office, he thought he was seeing the stuff of his party’s dreams. A week after former President Bill Clinton lit a political firestorm by strolling onto Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch’s plane for a private conversation, the director of the F. B. I. announced that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges over Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information. And then, just three hours later, President Obama and Mrs. Clinton emerged arm in arm from Air Force One in North Carolina for their first joint campaign rally. But this politically pregnant convergence of events was not met with a battalion of   Republican law enforcement and national security officials flooding the television airwaves to raise questions about the inquiry and hammer Mrs. Clinton. Nor was there any     video contrasting what the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, called Mrs. Clinton’s “extremely careless” handling of 110 classified emails with the former secretary of state’s shifting explanations over the last year about her use of a private email server. There were not even any talking points sent to leading Republican members of Congress offering guidance on the best lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton in the aftermath of what was a remarkably harsh assessment of her conduct. “Instead we’re relying on somebody who’s tweeting with exclamation points,” said Mr. Walsh, referring to Donald J. Trump’s initial response to Mr. Comey’s news conference. Mr. Trump’s improvisational response to the conclusion of an F. B. I. investigation against his opponent that had been months in the making illustrated the lingering deficiencies of his skeletal campaign and the lack of   Republicans with foreign policy experience who are willing to speak on his behalf. For many in the party it also was a painful reminder of what could have been  —   how a different   could have capitalized on one of the most difficult days Mrs. Clinton has faced as a candidate. For the Republican establishment, the months since Mr. Trump began closing in on the presidential nomination have been a season of dismay and frustration: Handed a historically weak Democratic opponent to run against, the party’s voters responded by nominating a candidate even more unpopular and toxic than Mrs. Clinton. But there have been few days during this cycle of disbelief in which the sense of regret has been as palpable for Republican strategists and policy makers as when Mr. Comey jolted the political world back to life after a long holiday weekend. “Imagine Jeb Bush looking disappointed and talking about the importance of following the rules and a society ruled by law with a government that is held accountable,” said Kori Schake, a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution and a national security aide in George W. Bush’s administration who is now backing Mrs. Clinton. “This should be a really great moment for a Republican nominee. But there’s no way in the world Donald Trump could pull that off. ” Mr. Trump’s campaign did, in fact, issue a longer statement regarding Mrs. Clinton’s email use beyond his initial assessment of “very very unfair!” and he used his own rally Tuesday night in North Carolina to assail his Democratic rival. “We are talking about the safety of our people,” he told a crowd in Raleigh. “The laws are very explicit. Stupidity is not a reason that you’re going to be innocent. ” Yet for many in his own party, there was deep angst over the possibility that they could lose to a Democratic candidate who was just deemed by one of the country’s most highly respected law enforcement officials to have presided over a State Department whose lackadaisical security culture invited foreign hackers. “He’s making somebody who should be sitting in a jail cell look like the sane choice for president,” said John Noonan, a former Air Force officer who served as a national security aide to Mitt Romney in 2012 and in Mr. Bush’s campaign this year. “This should have been a   putt. But Republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. And that’s what we’ve done. ” What was especially exasperating to so many in the party was that the turn of events over the last week was only the latest opportunity in a month for Mr. Trump to go on the offensive. The Islamic   rampage in Orlando, Fla. and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union offered him prime political moments, but he unnecessarily inserted himself into each story and saw no improvement in his standing in the polls. “Trump overtakes news cycles at every turn,” complained Mr. Walsh. “My God, he was on his golf course saying what a good thing the pound’s collapse would be for his bottom line. ” (Some Republicans feared Mr. Trump was again frittering away an opportunity when, rather than focusing entirely on the F. B. I. probe, he used his speech on Tuesday night to offer praise for Saddam Hussein.) However, in a campaign year animated by a voter revolt against Washington and the perceived   of an    political class there may be no more of a gift than what Mr. Comey delivered to an outsider candidate like Mr. Trump, whose jeremiads against what he calls a “rigged” system have been central to his improbable rise. “This is an example of what voters are totally fed up with,” said Liesl Hickey, the former executive director of the House Republican campaign arm, alluding to the F. B. I. ’s decision to not recommend charges. But Ms. Hickey, pointing out that Mr. Trump refuses to release his income tax returns, noted that the candidate also bore his own baggage on the very argument he is making against Mrs. Clinton. “Americans also think the system is rigged for the top 1 percent, so they think the system could be rigged for him, too,” she said. Whether it is with his taxes, his pronouncements or his willingness to raise money and create a sophisticated organization, Mr. Trump has gleefully flouted convention. “He doesn’t think traditional campaigns matter as much anymore, that he can do this on social media,” said Jim Merrill, a New   Republican strategist. “But the truth is, running a campaign still matters a great deal. And if we had nominated anyone else we’d be up on Hillary. But we’re down because we’ve got an incompetent candidate who has alienated large swaths of the electorate. ” For his part, Mr. Walsh was just flabbergasted that his party had a nominee whose war room often seems to begin and end with the candidate’s Twitter feed. “Why would he rush out a tweet as his primary response?” wondered Mr. Walsh. “He’s just demonstrating he is unable or unwilling to appear presidential at moments like this, when it’s required. ”"
20829,Hillary Clinton Embraces Ideas From Bernie Sanders’s College Tuition Plan - The New York Times,New York Times,Stephanie Saul and Matt Flegenheimer,B,2016-07-07,2016.0,7.0,,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign announced a proposal on Wednesday to eliminate tuition at   public colleges and universities for families with annual incomes up to $125, 000  —   largely embracing a core position of Senator Bernie Sanders, who had pledged to make tuition at public institutions free for all students. While stopping short of Mr. Sanders’s vision, the proposal is likely to hearten many of the senator’s young supporters who had flocked to his insurgent campaign. Mrs. Clinton and her aides are working to unite the party behind her before the Democratic National Convention begins on July 25 in Philadelphia. She and Mr. Sanders have already discussed the importance of featuring the issue of the affordability of higher education prominently in the general election. Mr. Sanders, who has yet to end his candidacy and endorse Mrs. Clinton, praised her education proposal as a “very bold initiative” in a brief news conference in Washington on Wednesday, calling it a significant step for party unity. “The final product is the work of both campaigns,” he said  —   a clear sign of thawing relations between the two after a bitterly fought nominating contest. The policy proposals come as Mrs. Clinton has been engaged in intensely personal sparring with Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and could be an effort to turn the page in her campaign a day after the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, was sharply critical of her “extremely careless” use of a private email address and server. Under Mrs. Clinton’s education proposal, the federal government would provide tuition grants to states that agree to put up some matching money. In some respects, the proposal was similar to one Mrs. Clinton made last year. At that time, however, she said she would expect families to make a “realistic contribution” to tuition payments. Also, borrowing a key aspect of Mr. Sanders’s plan, the new proposal appears to make tougher demands on states than her previous one. Education policy experts generally praised the new proposal, calling the requirements for state financial participation essential to reversing the drastic state cuts in higher education support. But some experts said details of the initiative  —   including exactly how it would work and be paid for  —   were sketchy, and raised concerns that some states would decline to contribute money. They also raised questions about the impact on private colleges and universities with small endowments that compete with state institutions. “To the extent that it borrows from the Sanders system of   matching, that’s a very significant step forward in our judgment,” said Barmak Nassirian, the director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, whose membership includes many regional public universities. “The reason prices have gone up is that states have been withdrawing their support. ” F. King Alexander, the chancellor of Louisiana State University, who has advocated a state matching requirement in federal education funding, said the Clinton campaign had been in contact with him about the proposal. “The most important part of the plan is that the federal government plays a role in getting states to reinvest and keep higher education affordable at public colleges and universities,” Mr. Alexander said. “You can only play in the free college game if your state maintains its commitment. ” Mrs. Clinton had previously raised questions about that aspect of Mr. Sanders’s plan, saying it gave states the ability to opt out, just as some had done with Medicaid expansion. As recently as this spring, Mrs. Clinton scoffed at the idea that Republican governors like Scott Walker of Wisconsin  —   who has slashed state spending on the University of Wisconsin  —   would ever go along with Mr. Sanders and support state matching funds to qualify for his proposed federal tuition grants. She was almost surely right  —   and on Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr. Walker said the governor would not go along with her plan, either, seeing it as costly and ineffective. The Clinton campaign was struggling with the question of what would happen if some states refused to participate, said an education expert who was consulted on the plan. In addition to possible opposition from states that would not want to pay or that resent federal intrusion, the plan might face resistance from private colleges and universities that compete with public institutions receiving the federal money, even though it pledges $25 billion over 10 years to help historically black colleges and other private colleges with modest endowments. “Our biggest concern with it is how it limits student choice,” said Sarah A. Flanagan, the vice president of government relations for the   National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. “It would put a lot of subsidies  —   well over $100 billion in new money  —   towards major economic incentives for people to go to their   public colleges, not even    public colleges. It certainly limits student choice. ” Mrs. Clinton had previously said she would raise the money for her education plan, estimated last year to cost $350 billion over 10 years, by limiting deductions for   taxpayers. The additional cost of the proposals announced Wednesday would be covered by closing tax loopholes, particularly those used by hedge funds and private equity firms, the campaign said. Mr. Sanders had said his plan to make college tuition free would have cost $70 billion a year, with   of that paid for by states. As part of her package of proposals, Mrs. Clinton, who speaks often on the campaign trail of her plans for   college education, is also calling for a   moratorium on the repayment of federal student loans. The move, which the campaign said would be carried out through executive action if Mrs. Clinton becomes president, would allow borrowers to refinance loans or restructure   debt. Mrs. Clinton is also pledging to restore   Pell Grant funding, her campaign said, in the hopes of aiding students seeking summer courses, and will also require that students work 10 hours a week to help pay the cost of their college attendance. If adopted, her initiative would take shape over several years, the campaign said, initially covering students whose families make $85, 000 a year or less. The threshold would increase by $10, 000 a year until it reached $125, 000 in 2021. The announcement arrives as Mr. Sanders and his allies seek to exert maximum influence over the official Democratic platform, hoping to push Mrs. Clinton to the left on a number of fronts. Adam Green, one of the founders of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an advocacy group, said the announcement on Wednesday “should be welcome news for Bernie Sanders supporters. ” “This represents a doubling down by Hillary Clinton on the idea that if you’re a student in America, you should be able to attend your state’s public colleges or universities and graduate with zero debt,” Mr. Green said in a statement. “It would be smart general election messaging if the popular idea of   college with a   component gets enshrined in the Democratic platform. ” At his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders said: “I want to take this opportunity this afternoon to applaud Secretary Clinton for the very bold initiative she has brought forth for the financing of higher education. This proposal combines some of the strongest ideas which she fought for during the campaign with some of the principles that I fought for. ”"

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Minnesota’s governor called for a federal investigation into the police shooting of a black man, Philando Castile, during a traffic stop. Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, above, streamed the aftermath live on Facebook, immersing viewers in the grisly scene, below. It has been replayed more than four million times. With a composure periodically fractured by wailing, she described an officer shooting at least four times after Mr. Castile began complying with a request to produce his registration  —   and alerted the officer that he had a licensed gun. An emotional President Obama said “all Americans should be troubled” by the shootings caught on video this week in Minnesota and Louisiana. _____ 2. A House panel questioned the F. B. I. director, James Comey, for nearly four hours about the bureau’s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. Under strong Republican pressure, Mr. Comey reiterated that while Mrs. Clinton’s use of a personal email network as secretary of state showed “great carelessness,” it did not meet the bar for criminality. But he also said a series of her statements were untrue. Those included her assertions that none of the emails were marked classified and that she had turned over all   emails. _____ 3. Donald Trump held a series of meetings with congressional Republicans that turned rocky. A spokesman for Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the meeting had not persuaded him to endorse Mr. Trump, calling the election “a Dumpster fire. ” Mr. Trump also raised a new wave of anxiety about his motives and temperament, hedging when asked about speculation that he might win the presidency but decline to serve. “I’ll let you know how I feel about it after it happens,” he told our reporter. _____ 4. Democrats are seeking to leverage Mr. Trump’s unpopularity among broad sectors of voters in other November elections. They plan to spend $1 million on ads painting the Republican Party as one with Mr. Trump. And several Democrats said Bernie Sanders would endorse Mrs. Clinton next week. _____ 5. Good news for the   : Researchers found that riding an electric bike  —   one that supplements rather than replaces the rider’s effort  —   can still provide a workout comparable to brisk walking or an easy jog. And the 20 subjects reported that their rides were “a blast,” the study’s lead author said. _____ 6. Germany took a significant step on women’s rights. German lawmakers unanimously passed a law that makes it easier to prosecute violence against women. It defines rape as a violation of a woman’s will, affirming that “no means no. ” The measure includes a provision for abuses in crowds, which was added after reports of widespread sexual assault in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. Above, a protest over those assaults in January. _____ 7. One of our   stories today is an essay by a former hedge fund trader on the damage done by pervasive, sexist “bro talk” in the financial world.   comments about women’s bodies and sexual appeal, he writes, produce “a force field of disrespect and exclusion that makes it incredibly difficult for women to ascend the Wall Street ladder. ” _____ 8. Opening this weekend: “The Secret Life of Pets,” an animated,   frolic voiced by the likes of Louis C. K. Hannibal Buress, Jenny Slate, Kevin Hart and Ellie Kemper. Our reviewer writes, “While this movie never achieves  —   and does not really aim for  —   the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of ‘Zootopia,’ it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit. ” _____ 9. “The lake was our mother and our father.

20898,G.O.P. Seeks Criminal Inquiry of Hillary Clinton’s Testimony to Congress - The New York Times,New York Times,Eric Lichtblau and Michael S. Schmidt,M,2016-07-26,2016.0,7.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Republican leaders asked the Justice Department on Monday to open a criminal investigation into whether Hillary Clinton lied to Congress in testimony last fall about her private email server, opening a new front in their   attacks on the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The Republican request, five days after the department closed a yearlong investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information in the emails, threatens to shadow her through the campaign and perhaps even into the White House if she is elected. In a letter Monday evening, House Republicans asked the Justice Department to determine whether Mrs. Clinton had “committed perjury and made false statements” during her appearance in October before a special House panel on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The letter was signed by Representatives Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who leads the Oversight Committee, and Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who leads the Judiciary Committee. The Justice Department declined to comment on the request. In a Twitter post, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, called the Republican request “another futile, partisan attempt to keep this issue alive now that the Justice Dept has declared it resolved. ” Mrs. Clinton has said she regrets the decision to use a private email server for official communications as secretary of state, but she has defended the truthfulness of her public remarks. Legal analysts said that while it appeared unlikely the F. B. I. would ultimately find enough evidence to prosecute Mrs. Clinton on charges of lying to Congress, there might be enough to warrant opening an investigation. That alone could prove damaging to her campaign. Republicans have seized on a number of contradictions between what Mrs. Clinton told Congress about her private email server and what the F. B. I. found in its investigation. Mrs. Clinton told the House Select Committee on Benghazi, for instance, that she had turned over all her “ ” emails to the State Department and that “nothing” in the more than 60, 000 emails routed through her private server “was marked classified at the time I sent or received it. ” The F. B. I. investigation found that, in fact, there were “thousands” of   emails that her lawyers did not turn over, and that a handful of emails were marked classified at the time  —   although the State Department now says they should not have been. Still, it would be difficult for prosecutors to show that she intended to mislead Congress  —   a high legal bar  —   and that she should be criminally prosecuted for it. In eight hours of testimony during a marathon   session of the Benghazi committee, Mrs. Clinton was careful to hedge a number of answers about her email system by saying that she was basing her statements on information from her lawyers. “There’s not a snowball’s chance in hell that she’d be convicted of anything,” Rusty Hardin, a prominent Texas lawyer, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Hardin won an acquittal of the baseball pitcher Roger Clemens in 2012 when the Justice Department  —   acting on a similar referral from Congress  —   accused him of lying to Congress about his use of steroids. Mr. Hardin said that “somewhere in that 11 hours, there might be something that turned out wasn’t accurate, but she’d have to be certifiably insane to intentionally mislead them when there’s a criminal investigation going on. ” Michael Bopp, a Washington lawyer who has examined similar referrals from Congress, said that criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton appeared doubtful because of the difficulty in establishing whether she intended to lie to Congress, rather than simply making statements that later proved untrue. “I do think they’re going to feel obligated to open an investigation,” he said, “but it will be difficult to bring a case. ” Republicans sent a separate letter on Monday to James B. Comey Jr. the F. B. I. director, criticizing his decision not to seek criminal charges in the case and asking him to explain his thinking. For Democrats, the threat of another   investigation was more evidence of what they see as a partisan witch hunt meant to derail Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. “The F. B. I. said there was no case, but the Republicans just try and keep it alive,” Henry Waxman, a former Democratic congressman from California, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Waxman, who sought a Justice Department investigation in the Clemens case, predicted that prosecutors would decline to move forward against Mrs. Clinton and that Republicans would then “complain that the Justice Department is acting on political reasons. ” Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the   Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said that Republicans “are now completely unloading on Secretary Clinton with everything they’ve got  —   right before the presidential conventions. ” It is fairly unusual for members of Congress to refer cases to the Justice Department for criminal investigation. One of the last major referrals came in 2014, when the   House Ways and Means Committee voted to seek a criminal investigation against Lois Lerner, who was a central player in accusations that the Internal Revenue Service improperly targeted conservative nonprofit groups. After an investigation, the Justice Department declined last year to bring charges against her or anyone else. At a hearing last week before the House Oversight Committee, Mr. Comey was asked by Republicans whether Mrs. Clinton’s public statements  —   both to Congress and elsewhere  —   appeared to contradict what the F. B. I. had found. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, said to Mr. Comey that based on those contradictions, “isn’t it a logical assumption she may have misled Congress, and we need to look at that further?” “I can understand why people would ask that question,” Mr. Comey said. He drew guffaws from some Republicans when he said that while he believed Mrs. Clinton had testified truthfully to the F. B. I. in a closed interview this month, his investigators had not examined the separate question of whether she lied under oath to Congress in her testimony. Mr. Comey told Mr. Chaffetz that such an inquiry would require a formal referral from Congress. “You’ll have one,” Mr. Chaffetz told him. “You’ll have one in the next few hours. ” Like many things in Congress, the referral did not move quite as quickly as predicted. It took the Republicans two business days to put in their demand  —   which, for Congress, was still pretty fast."
20905,"James Stavridis, Retired Admiral, Is Being Vetted as Hillary Clinton’s Running Mate - The New York Times",New York Times,Ashley Parker and Maggie Haberman,F,2016-07-13,2016.0,7.0,,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is vetting James G. Stavridis, a retired   Navy admiral who served as the 16th supreme allied commander at NATO, as a possible running mate, according to a person with knowledge of the vetting process. Some close to Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, say she was always likely to have someone with military experience on her   shortlist, and Mr. Stavridis, currently the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, fits the description. During his four years as NATO’s supreme allied commander, he oversaw operations in the Middle East  —   Afghanistan, Libya and Syria  —   as well as in the Balkans and piracy off the coast of Africa. The Clinton campaign declined requests for comment, and Mr. Stavridis declined to comment other than referring calls to the campaign. The person with knowledge of the vetting spoke anonymously because of the sensitive nature of the process. In 2012, Mr. Stavridis was investigated for having improperly used a military aircraft to fly with his wife to an exclusive party in Burgundy, France with winemakers. He was later cleared of misconduct after a long Pentagon investigation into his travel and expenses, including trips he took with his wife, daughter and mother. The Pentagon inspector general’s report ultimately concluded that he had failed to exercise sufficient oversight over staff members, and had made several bookkeeping mistakes. Donald J. Trump has also said he sees certain appeal to selecting someone with military experience as a running mate, and is considering retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. In an interview with ABC News over the weekend, Mr. Flynn, a lifelong Democrat, seemed to stumble, offering his support for abortion rights  —   a view out of lock step with Republican base orthodoxy. But in a phone interview with The New York Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Flynn “a patriot. ” Mr. Trump will continue his public audition process for possible running mates on Tuesday night, when he is set to appear at a campaign rally in Indiana with Mike Pence, the state’s governor."

21051,Hillary Clinton: Her Notable Moments - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-07-29,2016.0,7.0,,"The name Hillary Rodham first appeared in the pages of The New York Times 47 years ago, in a 1969 article about her commencement address at Wellesley, the women’s college in Massachusetts. It was five years before her husband, Bill Clinton, would be mentioned in The Times. Since then, The Times has covered her rise, beginning with her role as a lawyer and governor’s wife who first gained the national spotlight in Arkansas. She then became an influential first lady, United States senator, secretary of state and presidential candidate (twice). Here are some highlights from over the years. The country wasn’t sure what to make of Mrs. Clinton when she first burst on the national stage during the 1992 presidential campaign. A product of the feminist movement who had followed her husband to Arkansas, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be breaking the mold of candidate’s wife. And yet, talk of her hairstyle still permeated many conversations   …     and has ever since. Mrs. Clinton’s 1993 interview with The New York Times Magazine, in which she expounded on the “politics of meaning” and her Methodism and New Age beliefs, was met with widespread ridicule. It has often been cited as a reason for Mrs. Clinton’s reluctance to discuss her spiritual side. She even resisted wearing white for years after the magazine’s cover portrayed her as a saintly figure. Soon after her husband’s inauguration, Mrs. Clinton was appointed by the president as head of a task force on health care reform. It was her first time working to develop policy on a national stage, and it “ran into a political buzzsaw,” as The Times found in a 1994   on what critics nicknamed Hillarycare. Instead of cowering after a White House scandal broadcast Bill Clinton’s infidelities around the world, Mrs. Clinton did the opposite: She ran for the Senate in New York, subjecting herself to the harsh local tabloids. Her victory was the first time a first lady was elected to public office. (Never mind that she hadn’t been living in New York.) As the first woman with a real shot at the presidential nomination, Mrs. Clinton wasn’t sure how to approach gender. In her 2008 campaign, she emphasized strength and experience, often at the expense of warmth. The Times’s Mark Leibovich highlighted the few times she showed a softer side, as when she spoke at her friend Diane Blair’s funeral in 2000. After Mrs. Clinton lost to Barack Obama, she surprised the nation again by accepting the position of secretary of state and diving into diplomatic work. Although her tenure is now marked by controversy over her email, in the period she served as the country’s top diplomat, Mrs. Clinton enjoyed some of her highest approval ratings. Gallup consistently named her the country’s most admired woman. The image was of Mrs. Clinton’s facial features superimposed on a moon with the names of old Clinton friends, aides and   orbiting around her. It symbolized the challenges she would face as she considered another run for the presidency and how to organize the circle of people who hoped to tag along. As issues of race and criminal justice dominated the 2016 contest,   parts of Mrs. Clinton’s biography began to form a central part of her campaign’s story. Mrs. Clinton declined to be interviewed about the time in 1972 when she went undercover to investigate “segregation academies” in the South. But after an article about it ran, she and Bill Clinton talked openly about this chapter in her life, including at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia."
21103,Why Hillary Clinton’s Polling Bounce Has a Better Chance to Persist - The New York Times,New York Times,Nate Cohn,M,2016-08-02,2016.0,8.0,,"What a month. At the end of a series of tumultuous events and two political conventions, the presidential race is more or less where it was before it all began: Hillary Clinton has a clear lead. All seven national surveys conducted since the Democratic convention show her ahead, by an average of nearly seven percentage points. It’s a   boost over where those same surveys showed the race after the Republican convention  —   enough to erase Donald Trump’s bounce and more. She is about three points ahead of where she was before the two conventions. Convention bounces often prove to be   as the name implies and as Mr. Trump’s experience proves. Often,   bounces don’t even reflect real changes in support  —   just changes in how likely people are to respond to a poll or to indicate their support for a candidate. With that history in mind, Mrs. Clinton’s lead would be expected to fade a bit over the next few weeks. But her comfortable advantage in the   polls suggests that her support can fade and that she can still maintain a clear lead. There are also reasons to think that Mrs. Clinton’s bounce is likelier to stick than most. In general, convention bounces are most durable when they help unify the parties  —   something that’s largely inevitable and hard to undo. The latest CNN poll, which showed Mrs. Clinton ahead by nine points, suggests that she made her biggest gains among friendly groups, like young voters, supporters of Bernie Sanders and nonwhite voters. These gains could prove relatively durable. Notably, these gains have been enough to push Mrs. Clinton to 50 percent in three of the   surveys. Mrs. Clinton made gains among Republicans and white voters without a college degree, according to the CNN poll. But she’s still faring worse among those voters than the CNN poll has shown in the past, and even worse among white   voters than President Obama fared in   polls from 2012. The CNN poll showed that   supporters of Mrs. Clinton were likelier to say that they were supporting her as a vote against Mr. Trump, not because they supported her. Between those figures and Mrs. Clinton’s weak overall number with the group, she does not appear to have built her lead with voters who might be especially likely to return to Mr. Trump. The polls now put Mrs. Clinton a bit ahead of the level she held before James Comey, the F. B. I. director, excoriated her for her use of a private email server. She held a similar lead in April  —   before Mr. Trump won the nomination in May and narrowed her lead for the month or so that followed. This has been the race’s natural resting place when there hasn’t been something else suppressing Mrs. Clinton’s support  —   another reason to think she might be able to retain most of her bounce. For Mr. Trump, the danger is that he has few opportunities to prevent Mrs. Clinton from further consolidating her support over the coming weeks. There are few reasons to think he has helped himself since the convention by firing back at the parents of Humayun Khan and drawing condemnation from some Republican leaders. August is typically a fairly quiet month in presidential politics. The Olympics soak up national media coverage, which could make it harder for Mr. Trump to break through. Mrs. Clinton’s extensive paid advertising will continue unabated. Perhaps the most famous August shift in recent memory came from the “Swift Boat” ads that eroded John Kerry’s standing after his convention in 2004. If Mrs. Clinton retains most of her gains over the coming weeks, Mr. Trump’s chances in the race will start to look fairly bleak. Surveys conducted a few weeks after the conventions are far more predictive of the result than those taken ahead of or during the conventions. No modern presidential candidate who trailed in the polls a few weeks after the conventions has gone on to win the popular vote."
21210,Donald Trump Suggests ‘Second Amendment People’ Could Act Against Hillary Clinton - The New York Times,New York Times,Nick Corasaniti and Maggie Haberman,B,2016-08-11,2016.0,8.0,,"WILMINGTON, N. C.  —   Donald J. Trump on Tuesday appeared to raise the possibility that gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges who favor stricter gun control measures. Repeating his contention that Mrs. Clinton wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. Trump warned at a rally here that it would be “a horrible day” if Mrs. Clinton were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice. “If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: “Although the Second Amendment people  —   maybe there is, I don’t know. ” Oblique as it was, Mr. Trump’s remark quickly elicited a wave of condemnation from Democrats, gun control advocates and others, who accused him of suggesting violence against Mrs. Clinton or liberal jurists. Bernice A. King, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called Mr. Trump’s words “distasteful, disturbing, dangerous. ” Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, expressed disbelief. “Nobody who is seeking a leadership position, especially the presidency, the leadership of the country, should do anything to countenance violence, and that’s what he was saying,” Mr. Kaine said in Austin, Tex. He called Mr. Trump’s remark “a window into the soul of a person who is just temperamentally not suited to the task. ” And Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Trump’s statement was “repulsive  —   literally using the Second Amendment as cover to encourage people to kill someone with whom they disagree. ” “For Trump, violence has become a standard talking point, a common punch line, and even a campaign strategy,” Mr. Gross said. Paul D. Ryan, the Republican House speaker who has had a tense relationship with Mr. Trump, told reporters on Tuesday night that the remarks sounded “like a joke gone bad. ” He added: “You should never joke about that. I hope he clears it up quickly. ” Mr. Trump and his campaign did not treat his remark as a joke instead, they insisted he was merely urging gun rights supporters to vote as a bloc against Mrs. Clinton. “The Second Amendment people have tremendous power because they are so united,” he told a CBS affiliate in North Carolina late Tuesday. In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump grew adamant. “There can be no other interpretation,” he said, adding, “I mean, give me a break. ” But at his rally earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had actually been discussing what could happen once Mrs. Clinton was president, not before the election. And even many in the audience seemed caught by surprise. Video showed a man just over Mr. Trump’s shoulder go   and turn to his companion, apparently in disbelief, when Mr. Trump made the remark. The uproar over Mr. Trump’s    remark came as his campaign has been faced with a series of public opinion surveys showing him quickly losing ground to Mrs. Clinton, and just a day after his campaign called his delivery of a prepared economic speech in Detroit, evidence of a newfound political discipline. Mr. Trump’s fellow opponents of gun control stood by him, focusing on his depiction of Mrs. Clinton as a threat to the Second Amendment. “Donald Trump is absolutely correct,” said Jennifer Baker, a strategist for the National Rifle Association. “If Hillary Clinton is elected, there is nothing we can do to stop her from nominating an   Supreme Court justice who will vote to overturn the individual right of   citizens to own a gun in their home for protection. ” The association also began running a new commercial characterizing Mrs. Clinton as “one of the wealthiest women in politics” and calling her a hypocrite for favoring gun restrictions while having been “protected by armed guards for 30 years. ” Her gun policies, the ad says, would leave ordinary people “defenseless. ” Veiled references to gun violence have tripped up candidates before. In 2010, Sharron Angle, a Nevada Republican challenging the Senate majority leader at the time, Harry Reid, severely damaged her unsuccessful candidacy while discussing the importance of the Second Amendment. “When you read that Constitution and the founding fathers, they intended this to stop tyranny,” she said, adding: “It’s to defend ourselves. And you know, I’m hoping that we’re not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems. ” Mrs. Clinton herself learned the hard way: In June 2008, shortly before she conceded defeat in her Democratic primary contest with Barack Obama, she defended her perseverance in a way that critics said alluded to the possibility that Mr. Obama could be gunned down. “We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California,” Mrs. Clinton said. She apologized hours later. Mr. Trump did not repeat his violent insinuation at a later event in Fayetteville, N. C. But Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who has championed gun control since the Sandy Hook mass shooting in his state, called Mr. Trump’s remarks “disgusting and embarrassing and sad. ” “This isn’t play,” Mr. Murphy wrote. “Unstable people with powerful guns and an unhinged hatred for Hillary are listening to you, @realDonaldTrump. ” The condemnation from Mr. Trump’s critics across the political spectrum was deep. On Twitter, the conservative writer John Podhoretz, in a series of posts, wrote that Mr. Trump had implied that all Second Amendment supporters were “potential assassins. ” He added that a president’s words “CANNOT MEAN NOTHING. They are the most important words spoken in the world. ” And Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, wrote on Twitter that the Secret Service should investigate Mr. Trump for making a death threat against Mrs. Clinton: “Donald Trump suggested someone kill Sec. Clinton. We must take people at their word. ” A Secret Service spokesman, who refused to identify himself, said that the agency was “aware of the comments” but did not elaborate. Others seized on Mr. Trump’s remark as an occasion for mockery. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump “makes death threats because he’s a pathetic coward who can’t handle the fact that he’s losing to a girl. ” Mr. Trump’s campaign events have grown increasingly vitriolic, with angry chants and jeers directed at Mrs. Clinton. People at his rallies have, with greater frequency, loudly called for violence against Mrs. Clinton  —   catcalls that Mr. Trump has generally let pass. And on Saturday, Mr. Trump praised his New Hampshire state   State Representative Al Baldasaro, who said recently that Mrs. Clinton deserved to face a firing squad over the F. B. I. ’s investigation of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. In Wilmington on Tuesday, chants of “lock her up,” which first gained traction during the Republican National Convention, were loud and frequent before Mr. Trump took the stage. But one speaker, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, tried to tamp those down. “No, no, we’re here to beat her, and keep her out of Washington,” Mr. Giuliani said. He was interrupted by the same chant minutes later."
21211,Stress Over Family Finances Propelled Hillary Clinton Into Corporate World - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-08-11,2016.0,8.0,,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark.  —   Losing the governor’s race here in 1980 so shattered a young Bill Clinton that he could not face his supporters, so he sent his wife around to thank campaign workers instead. He later gathered with close friends for dinner but quietly sulked, playing the country song “I Don’t Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling” on the jukebox. But his wife had a more pressing concern: money. The ousted governor needed a job, the family needed a place to live, and moving out of the governor’s mansion meant losing the help they had as they raised their    daughter, Chelsea. The morning after the election, Hillary Clinton worked the phones from the mansion, calling wealthy friends and asking for help. “The world changed. There was a tectonic shift,” said Thomas F. McLarty III, a friend of Mr. Clinton’s who served as his White House chief of staff. Mr. Clinton was of little use as he fixated on voters’ rejection. And for the first time, friends said, Mrs. Clinton glimpsed fragility in the future she had moved to Arkansas to pursue. She worried about saving for Chelsea’s college, caring for her aging parents, and even possibly supporting herself should the marriage or their political dreams dissolve. “It was up to her to just keep holding things up,” said Nancy Pietrafesa, a college friend of Mrs. Clinton’s who moved to Arkansas to work for Mr. Clinton in the 1970s. Hillary Clinton’s relationship with money has long puzzled even some of her closest supporters: Despite choosing a life in government, she has appeared eager to make money, driven to provide for her family and helping amass a fortune of more than $50 million with her husband. But Mrs. Clinton can seem blind to how her financial decisions are viewed, and has suffered repeated political damage and accusations of conflicts of interest as a result  —   from serving on the corporate board of Walmart while her husband was governor to initially accepting a $1. 35 million mortgage personally secured by a top   for the family’s home in Chappaqua, N. Y. Her collection of more than $21 million in speaking fees from a range of groups, including Wall Street firms and other interests, led to one of the most potent attacks against her in this election cycle, given voters’ anger about economic inequality. Half of all voters said it bothered them “a lot’’ that Mrs. Clinton gave numerous speeches to Wall Street banks, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted in June. Donald J. Trump has called Mrs. Clinton “totally owned by Wall Street. ” Mr. Trump, whose own finances have drawn extensive scrutiny, may be an imperfect messenger, but “Republicans can say, ‘This undercuts everything she is saying about what she wants to do to regulate Wall Street and her economic populist stance,’” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. Even some of Mrs. Clinton’s allies privately say they are mystified by her choice to make the Wall Street speeches, given the likelihood that they would become an issue in a presidential campaign. And to some of them, her financial moves clash with the selfless Methodist credo to do good for others that she so often says guided her toward a life of public service. But her longtime friends say the contradiction is rooted in Mrs. Clinton’s practicality and the    cycles that have characterized her life with Bill Clinton. At no time did those stresses fall more squarely on Mrs. Clinton’s shoulders than in the difficult   period in Arkansas when she and her husband found themselves cast out of office, financially strained and deeply uncertain about the future. And the memory of that time shaped her desire to be free from financial burden. “Hillary had a couple years of the taste of what it means to be a working mother, without any help, to have to take care of a small baby and care for your job,” said James B. Blair, a close Clinton friend and lawyer who offered Mrs. Clinton investment advice in the 1970s. The Clintons’ unexpected ouster from their comfortable life occurred at a time when Arkansas was swirling with new money and    schemes as companies like Tyson and Walmart minted millionaires and new savings and loan institutions were spreading throughout the South. A generation of Ivy   young people like Mr. Clinton had returned to their home state to make their mark. Money seemed to be all around the Clintons, but they did not have much of their own. And unlike Mrs. Clinton, a worrier by nature, Mr. Clinton, consumed with his dreams of a political career, seemed indifferent to securing a financial future. “He was never interested in money, ever,” Mr. Blair said. “She is the one who had to be sure Chelsea was going to be able to afford college. ” People close to Mrs. Clinton don’t begrudge her desire to provide generously for her family, and certainly many presidential candidates and public servants acquire vast personal wealth. Asked in an interview whether earlier financial stresses had prompted her to pursue the lucrative speechmaking, Mrs. Clinton said, “I really think it’s much simpler than that,” adding that it is typical for secretaries of state to share their views in speeches after leaving office. It was one of the smallest houses on the block in Little Rock’s Hillcrest section, and Mrs. Clinton largely bought it with her own money, the month after that devastating 1980 election loss. She filled the rooms with mismatched furniture bought at thrift stores and borrowed from her flamboyant   . She converted the windowed attic into a bedroom for Chelsea, parked her Oldsmobile Cutlass in the weedy driveway and chased after the family’s cocker spaniel, Zeke, who liked to chew through the fence. The Clintons had stretched their finances to afford the $112, 000 home, which was down the hill from the city’s   mansions. The sprawling estate of Winthrop Rockefeller, the celebrated former governor, was so close that it practically cast a shadow on the Clintons’ grassy backyard. Friends described the décor as unsightly, a jarring departure from the governor’s mansion. “That couch just jumped out at me,” said Bobby Roberts, a former aide to Mr. Clinton, describing a   Victorian chaise that Mr. Clinton’s mother, Virginia Kelly, had lent them. “It was in some bright, violent color. ” And with no parents or   in Little Rock, Mrs. Clinton turned to friends and neighbors for help. She persuaded Carolyn Huber, who had helped run the governor’s mansion while Mr. Clinton was in office, to continue to help care for Chelsea, who had grown fond of her. A neighbor, Manuel J. Lozano, recalled: Hillary “was running around, and my wife took care of Chelsea here and there whenever she needed help. ” Mr. Clinton had turned down    job offers in academia and Democratic politics, and instead took the only offer he had in Arkansas, to serve “of counsel” for $55, 000 a year at the Wright, Lindsey  Jennings law firm, where Mr. Clinton’s longtime adviser Bruce R. Lindsey was a partner. But he spent most of his time on the road, often accompanied by Mr. Lindsey, trying to win back the hearts of voters. “He had to go all over that state, touch base and apologize, and listen to why he lost,” Mrs. Pietrafesa recalled, “and every one of those visits was a     or   ordeal. ” Mrs. Clinton had become a partner at the Rose Law Firm in 1979, and during these lean years, she balanced her work there with caring for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk in the Hillcrest house, on Midland Street. She often felt on her own as Mr. Clinton crisscrossed the state, friends said. She increased her hours to bring in work for the firm, with business not as easy to come by now that she was no longer the governor’s wife. “The whole time period was a point of learning, after the defeat,” Jerry C. Jones, Mrs. Clinton’s colleague at the firm, remembered. Friends said she would have focused on public service and charitable work and not gone to work at the firm  —   a practice known for representing the business and political elite  —   had she not been concerned about her family’s finances. Ann Henry, an Arkansas friend, described Mrs. Clinton as an “oddity” there, where other women, mostly secretaries and paralegals, gawked at her curls and   clothes. (Mrs. Clinton worked at the Rose Law Firm for roughly 15 years, the longest she has worked at any job, though it is not on her official campaign biography.) “I’m not sure she ever planned to be a corporate lawyer,” said Lissa Muscatine, a friend and former chief speechwriter to Mrs. Clinton. But she did the work because “she had the earning capacity that he didn’t have as governor. ” Growing up in the    suburb of Park Ridge, Ill. Hillary Rodham  —   whose mother had been raised in poverty and whose   father preached frugality  —   babysat and held summer jobs beginning when she was 13. Her father, Hugh Rodham, taught his only daughter fiscal responsibility and how to read stock tables in the newspaper. But he was not one to shower his children with material things. “Her mother came from nothing and her father was   so there’s always been an awareness of working hard to earn a living,” said Lisa Caputo, a friend and former White House aide. There was anxiety, too. The family was never comfortably affluent, and even as Mr. Rodham bought himself a Cadillac, he insisted that his wife and children live modestly. Hillary and her brothers helped at his drapery business, which eventually closed after sales slowed. By the time she was a student at Wellesley College, Mrs. Clinton and many in her generation were expressing skepticism about the pursuit of money. In her 1969 commencement speech, she denounced materialism and corporate greed. “We’re searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living,” she declared. When she moved to Fayetteville, Ark. and later married Mr. Clinton in 1975, the Yale   couple lived happily earning about $18, 000 a year each in their positions as professors. But several years later, as Mr. Clinton planned his run for the governor’s office and the couple worried about starting a family, Mrs. Clinton grew increasingly uneasy about their incomes and started to think more seriously about how to build a nest egg. “She had been the chief breadwinner and financial decision maker,” her best friend, Diane D. Blair, wrote in notes she kept about the era. Arkansas was a small state with overlapping circles of the politically and economically powerful  —   and many of the Clintons’ contemporaries were getting rich. “The smart guys who were politically active would make that interesting investment that would push them from the ranks of the upper middle class into the wealthy and powerful,” said William K. Black, a former financial regulator and professor at the University of   City. Mrs. Clinton began seeking out investment opportunities, and in 1978 she made one of the most lucrative, if seemingly risky, financial decisions of her life. Mr. Blair, the Clintons’ close friend, had made several million dollars in the commodities market, and urged Mrs. Clinton to begin trading, too. With an initial investment of just $1, 000, she made nearly $100, 000 trading cattle futures in a   period, which helped pay for the down payment on the Midland Street home. But the move later haunted her when the investment became the subject of scrutiny in the early years of the Clinton presidency. It still trails her occasionally: Mr. Trump raised it at a rally last month in North Carolina, as he attacked her for being “crooked. ” “Look at her cattle futures! ’’ he called out to the crowd. Also in 1978, another friend, James B. McDougal, persuaded Mrs. Clinton to invest in another venture: the Whitewater real estate development on a plot of land in the Ozarks. The Clintons ultimately lost money on the deal, but the development led to an investigation when Mr. Clinton was in the White House. The deals were certainly tempting, given the couple’s income at the time. In 1978, Mr. Clinton became one of the youngest, and lowest paid, governors, in the country, earning $33, 519. 14 his first year in office. Mrs. Clinton’s income from the Rose Law Firm brought their combined wages in 1978 to $51, 173. Even though she reaped big rewards on the commodities market, the experience was unnerving. Shortly after Chelsea was born, Mrs. Clinton told her broker she wanted out. “I couldn’t take the stress,” she said at a campaign stop in June. She would, however, continue to shoulder her family’s financial worries. Not long after Mr. Clinton won   in 1982, the Clintons sold the yellow house on Midland Street and moved back into the governor’s mansion, where they once again had free housing and the assistance of a small staff. Two years later, the state increased the governor’s term to four years, and the Clintons’ finances appeared more stable. Mrs. Clinton went on to join the board of Walmart, and she continued to work at the Rose Law Firm. By the time Mr. Clinton was running for president, they reported $297, 177 in total income on their 1992 tax returns, a sum that would put most Americans in the upper income tier but seemed meager compared with the wealth of his opponents, George Bush and Ross Perot. “When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman,” Mr. Clinton has said. The White House years offered a respite from financial worry. As first lady, Mrs. Clinton wrote a book, “It Takes a Village,’’ for which she did not accept an advance and donated the proceeds to charity. “HRC insists she will have time, wants it to have impact (of course, also wants it to make huge bucks),” Mrs. Blair wrote at the time. Still, the couple’s earlier financial decisions resurfaced in damaging ways. What started as an investigation into the Whitewater investment spun into revelations of Mr. Clinton’s relationship with a White House intern, which led to the president’s impeachment by the House of Representatives. When the Clintons left the White House after the 2000 election  —   the first time they were without the safety net of public office in 18 years  —   they owed $5 million in legal fees and once again felt financial uncertainty. In 2014, Mrs. Clinton described her family’s situation at the time in words that have bedeviled her candidacy: “Dead broke. ” Once again, the Clintons needed a house, and once again they turned to the help of a wealthy friend. This time it was Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton campaign   who offered to guarantee the mortgage on the home they would move into after leaving the White House. But this time, the home  —   a $1. 7 million,   Dutch Colonial in Chappaqua, a rich suburb  —   was not one of the smallest houses on the block. Mrs. Clinton did not have to call the   every time the old pipes clogged or run to a neighbor’s house to borrow milk and eggs, as she had done in the house on Midland Street. And now it was Mrs. Clinton, eyeing a Senate seat from New York, who left her husband at home as she hit the road, crisscrossing the state for her campaign."
21224,The Millions of Americans Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Barely Mention: The Poor - The New York Times,New York Times,Binyamin Appelbaum,M,2016-08-12,2016.0,8.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   The United States, the wealthiest nation on Earth, also abides the deepest poverty of any developed nation, but you would not know it by listening to Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump, the major parties’ presidential nominees. Mrs. Clinton, speaking about her economic plans on Thursday near Detroit, underscored her credentials as an advocate for   families whose fortunes have flagged. She said much less about helping the 47 millions Americans who yearn to reach the middle class. Her Republican rival, Mr. Trump, spoke in Detroit on his economic proposals four days ago, and while their platforms are markedly different in details and emphasis, the candidates have this in common: Both promise to help Americans find jobs neither has said much about helping people while they are not working. “We don’t have a   condemnation of the level or extent of poverty in America today,” said Matthew Desmond, a Harvard professor of sociology. “We aren’t having in our presidential debate right now a serious conversation about the fact that we are the richest democracy in the world, with the most poverty. It should be at the very top of the agenda. ” It is not as if Washington policy makers have completely forgotten the poor. President Obama and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin have advocated expanding the   tax credit for childless men and tackling a criminal justice system that has saddled minor offenders with lives of economic struggle. And Mrs. Clinton’s policies, although rhetorically geared toward the middle class, would probably have a broader effect. On Thursday, in Warren, Mich. she again promised an economy that works for “everyone, not just those at the top. ” She has called for raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour from $7. 25 an hour, which would directly benefit many   workers. And her proposals to help the middle class would benefit some   families, too. She has proposed expanding federal subsidies for health care, child care and education, and mandating improved benefits for workers. “You want more?” Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, asked of those who argue that Mrs. Clinton should embrace an explicit   agenda. “That’s great. That is such an audacious statement. They want everything, and I am with them. But it is also worth noting that Hillary Clinton is running on the most progressive platform any party has put together. ” Ms. Boushey is an adviser to the Clinton campaign but said she was not speaking for it. The campaign itself did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump said Monday that he would spur economic growth by reducing taxes and regulation, and by renegotiating trade agreements to bring manufacturing back to the United States. He also outlined a plan to help some families offset the expense of child care. Mr. Trump said in July that he favored a $   federal minimum wage, but he has made contradictory remarks in other public appearances, the proposal does not appear in campaign materials, and he did not mention it in Detroit. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have said that they are focused on creating more and better jobs. “My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States,” Mrs. Clinton said in accepting the Democratic nomination in Philadelphia last month. But Mr. Desmond, the Harvard sociologist, said that was not enough because the poor faced a wide range of other obstacles to economic stability. His own work has focused on a growing shortage of affordable rental housing. In his recent book, “Evicted,” he showed that evictions were a regular feature of life in   neighborhoods, and that they were not just the result of poverty, but that instability causes poverty. Increasing affordable housing was until recently a standard campaign pledge for presidential candidates of both parties. President Bill Clinton created a “National Home Ownership Strategy. ” President George W. Bush announced early in his first term a target of creating 5. 5 million new minority homeowners by 2010, alongside measures to encourage the construction of rental housing. But Mrs. Clinton made only one glancing reference to affordable housing on Thursday, spending far more time on promoting entrepreneurship and small businesses, bolstering broadband access and reviving manufacturing. Her campaign website highlights 37 issues, but housing is not among them, although the campaign issued some proposals in February. Mr. Trump, during a speech in Miami to the National Association of Homebuilders on Thursday, lamented the decline of homeownership since the housing and financial crisis of 2008. But he stopped short of outlining a housing policy. “It was pretty shocking not to hear that word, housing, uttered on the main stage” at either party’s convention last month, Mr. Desmond said. The silence is particularly striking because the problem is growing. There is not a single state where a   worker earning the minimum wage can rent a     apartment for 30 percent or less of their income, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. And more than 11 million households spend more than half of their income on rent. Kathryn Edin, a professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University, said it was particularly important to focus on the plight of families without regular income. Federal benefits for workers, notably the   tax credit, have steadily expanded in recent decades, improving the lives of those who have jobs. Mr. Ryan presented an   plan in June that suggested another expansion of the tax credit, an idea that is also popular among many Democrats. But Ms. Edin said the 1996 deal  between the Clinton administration and congressional Republicans to curtail cash benefits for needy families had left those without jobs behind. “When you can’t pay the utility bill, you can’t pay the rent and you can’t buy socks and underwear for your kids, how much does the fact that you have a Medicaid card really do for you?” asked Ms. Edin, who wrote about the plight of such families in her 2015 book, “$2. 00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America. ” She said that she had hoped the 20th anniversary of the “end of welfare” might spark renewed discussions about what should be done instead, but that she had been disappointed. Ms. Edin and other advocates also express frustration that both candidates tend to focus on manufacturing, a sector that employs less than 10 percent of the work force. Mrs. Clinton chose to speak on Thursday at Futuramic Tool  Engineering, a company in Warren, Mich. just north of Detroit, which makes parts for cars and airplanes including the   fighter jet. Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to create new jobs for miners and steelworkers. The candidates have spent less time talking about the service jobs performed by the vast majority of   workers. There were 64, 000 steelworkers last year  —   and 820, 000 home health aides. “Much of what I hear is an argument over who is going to help the working class that’s been hurt by globalization, more than the retail or restaurant worker who is stuck at a low wage,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a   research group. “We have to be mindful of where those displaced manufacturing workers have ended up, which is in the   service sector. ” Mr. Trump’s policies, while ostensibly aimed at the middle class, would in fact benefit the rich. His call this week to eliminate the estate tax would affect only couples who were able to leave their heirs nearly $11 million at death. Estates worth less than that are exempt from taxation. Even his call for a greatly expanded tax deduction for child care costs would benefit only households that itemize their taxes, most of them with incomes over $75, 000. Mr. Bernstein did add that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals could benefit those workers, even if that was not her focus on the campaign trail. “It’s not at all unusual for people running for president not to talk about poverty because the poor are not necessarily the swing voters you’re trying to pick off,” he said. “But I actually think a lot of her proposals would help  —   she just doesn’t always connect the dots to poverty and   workers. ”"
21238,"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine Show New Tax Returns, Pressuring Donald Trump - The New York Times",New York Times,Steve Eder and Kitty Bennett,B,2016-08-16,2016.0,8.0,,"Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, released a new batch of their own income tax returns on Friday, ratcheting up the pressure on her opponent, Donald J. Trump, to begin making public his own forms. The newest tax return of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, showed an adjusted gross income of $10. 6 million for 2015, a large drop from previous years but still enough to place them in the top 0. 1 percent of American households. They paid about $3. 6 million in federal taxes for an effective tax rate of about 35 percent. More than half their income came from speeches Mrs. Clinton also earned $3 million from “Hard Choices,” her memoir of her years as secretary of state. Mr. Kaine, the Virginia senator, and his wife, Anne Holton, who was Virginia’s secretary of education until she stepped down last month, reported income of $313, 441 for 2015. But aside from their earnings, the release was intended to put a spotlight on Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his own returns. Mike Pence, the Indiana governor and Mr. Trump’s running mate, also has not made public his tax data during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton’s spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement the release sets a “stark contrast” with Mr. Trump, whom she accused of “hiding behind fake excuses. ” “He has failed to provide the public with the most basic financial information disclosed by every major candidate in the last 40 years,” she said. “What is he trying to hide?” The Trump campaign would not discuss his tax returns, but in a statement on Friday, a spokesman, Jason Miller, called Mrs. Clinton’s disclosure an effort to shield her from questions about her emails when she was secretary of state and about what favors were sought by donors to her family’s foundation. “This document release is nothing more than an attempt at distraction and misdirection by an individual who created and then purged an illegal private email server,” he said. If Mr. Trump does not make public the details of his taxes, he would be the first major party presidential nominee to decline to do so since Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Trump is not required as a candidate to reveal his taxes, but he has submitted his personal financial disclosure form outlining his business interests, which he is obligated to file. While Mr. Trump has cited an I. R. S. audit as his reason for not releasing his taxes, the agency said in a statement this year, “Nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information. ” The lack of a disclosure of his taxes has opened Mr. Trump to attacks, first during the Republican primary campaign and now in the months leading to the Nov. 8 general election. Critics have questioned whether Mr. Trump has not released his taxes because his reported earnings could be underwhelming in comparison to his own statements about his net worth. Others have suggested that the tax documents would reveal business interests that could be problematic if he were elected. There have also been questions about how much Mr. Trump has paid in taxes over the years, whether he in fact paid any federal taxes some years, and whether he has followed through on his charitable pledges. Given the expansive web of tax breaks available to real estate developers, tax experts say it would not be surprising if Mr. Trump paid little or no income taxes some years, even as he amassed billions of dollars in wealth. The Clintons’ income has also brought scrutiny, and their returns hint at how much they have relied on their star power and government connections to catapult them into the ranks of the super rich. Though they were once seen as relatable to average Americans, polls suggest that many voters now see them as out of touch. Their 2015 income, while less than half what they earned the previous year, put them well above the $2 million threshold for the top 0. 1 percent of taxpayers, according to an analysis of federal income tax data by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. They were within $1 million of reaching the 0. 01 percent threshold  —   or the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent. In recent years they have collected tens of millions of dollars in fees for speeches, including some delivered abroad and others sponsored by financial institutions. Mrs. Clinton has faced calls to release the transcripts of her speeches, particularly from the three she gave for Goldman Sachs for a total of $675, 000. Her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Mr. Trump have used those speeches to portray Mrs. Clinton as being chummy with Wall Street. In 2015, before she officially began her campaign and stopped giving speeches, she earned $1. 5 million in speaking fees. Her husband earned $5. 25 million from speeches last year. According to Mrs. Clinton’s personal financial disclosure filed in May, she and her husband made more than two dozen speeches in 2015 for $150, 000 and up. Mr. Clinton earned $225, 000 for a February speech sponsored by UBS Wealth Management, for example, and Mrs. Clinton gave a speech for eBay in March for $315, 000. Mr. Clinton also earned $1. 7 million from his consulting business, WJC L. L. C. after it brought in more than $6 million the year before, according to the tax returns. The financial disclosure from earlier this year said that two sources of consulting income were Varkey GEMS Foundation, an international charity founded by Sunny Varkey, an education entrepreneur, and Laureate Education, a network of   schools. These financial ties  —   including the past speeches, business endeavors and well as donor relationships with the Clinton Foundation  —   have already attracted critics who say they include inherent conflicts of interest and could be problematic under a Clinton administration. From 2007 to 2015, according to returns released Friday and previously, the Clintons made a total adjusted gross income of $150 million and paid $48 million in federal taxes. In the same period they gave $16 million to charity, including $1 million last year that went mostly to their family foundation. The Clintons’ other income last year included $24, 932 in interest, $84, 358 in mutual fund dividends and $226, 297 in pension payments from the federal and Arkansas governments. Their deductions included $1. 4 million in state income taxes and $98, 244 in property taxes on their homes in Chappaqua, N. Y. and Washington. They also wrote off $41, 040 in mortgage interest."
21309,Hillary Clinton Twists the Knife in Donald Trump’s Tax Proposals - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-08-22,2016.0,8.0,,"Hillary Clinton leaned into her plans to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans on Wednesday, denouncing Donald J. Trump’s tax proposals as a boondoggle for billionaires. “We’re going to tax the wealthy who have made all of the income gains in the last 15 years,” Mrs. Clinton told a crowd in Cleveland. “The superwealthy, corporations, Wall Street,” she declared emphatically, “they’re going to have to invest in education, in skills training, in infrastructure. ” For months, Mrs. Clinton has attacked Mr. Trump’s economic agenda in broad terms, portraying him as a follower of the “trickle down” orthodoxy of previous Republican administrations. But Mr. Trump’s release of his tax plans last week in Detroit allowed her to begin to criticize them more specifically. Just as President Obama attacked his 2012 rival, Mitt Romney, for paying a lower effective tax rate than the vast majority of Americans, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump’s plan would benefit people in his own income bracket, declaring that he “would pay a lower rate than   families” if it were put into effect. Mr. Trump has recommended cutting the top marginal income tax rate to 33 percent from the current 39. 6 percent, and broadening deductions for things like child care. Mr. Trump, conversely, has portrayed Mrs. Clinton as a    Democrat who supports policies that have caused 15 years of virtually stagnant wages. “For an economy desperate for a jump start, Clinton’s plan will only act as a straitjacket,” his campaign said on Wednesday. Mrs. Clinton’s spending plans, including a $250 billion investment in infrastructure and a $350 billion plan to make college more affordable, rely largely on changes to the tax code that would raise rates on the affluent and corporations. She supports the “Buffett rule,” which would require millionaires to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes, and wants to close the carried interest loophole that lets hedge fund managers pay a lesser tax rate on much of their income. She has also proposed an “exit tax” on corporations that move jobs overseas, and wants to limit tax deductions, impose a 4 percent tax surcharge for income over $5 million, and close corporate tax loopholes to help pay for her costly domestic agenda. After touring a job training program at John Marshall High School in Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton described how her plan would affect voters in Ohio, a critical swing state where she holds a   edge over Mr. Trump, according to an NBC   Street   poll. Referring to a report by Moody’s Analytics, she said her plan would create 376, 000 jobs in Ohio, while Mr. Trump’s plans would cost the state more than 123, 000 jobs. “I know that too many families right here in Ohio are feeling too much financial stress, worrying about how they’re going to make ends meet,” she said. Mrs. Clinton, who is sometimes mocked for the attention she pays to granular policy details, has taken particular aim at Mr. Trump’s proposal to cut taxes on what are known as   entities: businesses that do not pay corporate income taxes, but whose owners are taxed on individual profits. Calling this provision “the Trump loophole,” Mrs. Clinton asserted on Wednesday that it would allow Mr. Trump and business owners like him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from their own companies. Even some Republicans who support Mr. Trump’s promise to slash the tax rate on corporate profits to 15 percent, from the current 35 percent, have criticized the   provision. “While reducing corporate income rates is generally good, the   exemption is a bad policy,” said Kyle E. Pomerleau, the director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank. He explained that the provision would “create a lot of behavioral incentives” for people to restructure how they earn income “in order to get a more favorable rate. ” Polling suggests that Mrs. Clinton’s focus on tax issues could resonate with voters, because most Americans agree with the thrust of her ideas. Almost   64 percent, of Americans said they were bothered a lot by the feeling that some corporations are not paying what is fair in federal taxes, and 61 percent said the same about some wealthy people, according to a 2015 poll from the Pew Research Center. While the weeds of tax policy can be a difficult sell to voters, the broader issue of income inequality has motivated voters this election year. “The tax system is the poster child for all of that,” said Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, an advocacy organization. “It’s through this lens that people really see the system as corrupt and benefiting rich people. ” To that end, Mrs. Clinton tried to sprinkle personal stories around her policy details. “I am proud to be the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a   man and standing here before you,” she said, while portraying her rival as part of the top 1 percent in terms of wealth. She said Mr. Trump’s plan to eliminate the estate tax would save his family an estimated $4 billion, which, by Mrs. Clinton’s calculations, would pay for publicly funded prekindergarten classes for 890, 000    and provide a year’s worth of health care for 360, 000 veterans. “Donald Trump doesn’t need a tax cut,” she said. She waited for the crowd to quiet down, and then Mrs. Clinton, whose tax returns show that she and former President Bill Clinton earned an adjusted gross income of $10. 6 million in 2015, added, “I don’t need a tax cut. ”"
21346,Judge Orders Written Testimony From Hillary Clinton on Emails - The New York Times,New York Times,Steven Lee Myers,M,2016-08-24,2016.0,8.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   A federal judge on Friday ordered Hillary Clinton to provide written testimony under oath about why she set up a private computer server to send and receive emails while secretary of state, ensuring that the issue will continue to dog her presidential campaign until the eve of the election. In a brief ruling issued on Friday afternoon, the judge, Emmet G. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Washington, approved a motion by the conservative advocacy organization Judicial Watch to pursue its vigorous campaign to expose Mrs. Clinton’s use of the private server. In addition to requiring her testimony in writing, the judge allowed the group to depose a senior State Department aide who had warned two subordinates not to question her email practices. Only six weeks ago, the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey Jr. declined to recommend prosecuting Mrs. Clinton, saying that while her actions had been careless, they did not amount to a crime. Yet the controversy refuses to dissipate. This week, the bureau turned over to Congress the documents it compiled in the case, including a     hour interview with Mrs. Clinton, even as Republicans in Congress pressed their public case for her to be charged with perjury. Judge Sullivan’s ruling opened another front in a fight Mrs. Clinton’s campaign certainly hoped to put behind her. Although he declined to order her to answer questions in person, his ruling underscored the legal complications that Mrs. Clinton faces even as she enters the homestretch of her campaign. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, Brian Fallon, sharply criticized Judicial Watch’s legal campaign, saying it was “a   organization that has been attacking the Clintons since the 1990s. ” “This is just another lawsuit intended to try to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” he said. Judge Sullivan gave Judicial Watch until Oct. 14 to submit questions to Mrs. Clinton  —   three and a half weeks before Election Day on Nov. 8. Significantly, perhaps, he ordered Mrs. Clinton to submit her answers within 30 days of that deadline, meaning she could delay her answers until after the election. The deposition of the senior aide, however, will take place by Oct. 31. The aide, John Bentel, a career foreign service officer who has since retired, was one of the officials in the State Department who seemed to be aware of Mrs. Clinton’s use of the server. At the time, he headed the part of her executive staff in charge of information management, including the preservation of emails and other records. According to the department’s inspector general, he rebuffed concerns raised in 2010 by two officials in the   division about whether her emails were being preserved for the record, instructing them “never to speak of the secretary’s personal email system again. ” Mr. Bentel has declined several requests through his lawyer to comment, but he will now be compelled to testify in person and under oath. Judicial Watch, which dogged Bill Clinton during his presidency, has brought several lawsuits seeking records from the State Department under the Freedom of Information of Act about various aspects of Mrs. Clinton’s tenure, including the employment status of her close aide Huma Abedin. Judge Sullivan, who has at times appeared sympathetic to the group’s demands for information, has compelled testimony from a number of department officials, including Ms. Abedin and Mrs. Clinton’s former chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills. The group’s president, Tom Fitton, expressed pleasure at the latest successful challenge, although the order fell short of the personal interview he may have wanted. “The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law,” he said in a statement."

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A decision made by General Motors years ago to save a few dollars per airbag may have led to the widespread use of the faulty Takata technology that has been blamed in the deaths of 14 people and become the subject of the auto industry’s largest recall. A Times investigation revealed that the automaker switched its supplier to Takata despite signs that ammonium nitrate, a compound used in its devices, was unsafe. Takata continues to manufacture airbags with the compound  —   and automakers continue to buy them. ______ 2. Hillary Clinton’s speech on Thursday found an unusual audience cheering it on: the “ ” crowd that she denounced in her remarks. Though Donald J. Trump has publicly kept his distance from the   her attack on him for fanning the flames of racism embraced by the community was celebrated by its leaders, who did their best to capitalize on the moment. And in Youngstown, Ohio, above,  —   a   Midwestern stronghold  —   residents are wrestling with whether a Manhattan billionaire can revitalize a struggling Rust Belt town. ______ 3. One of our most read stories examines the ultraconservative strain of Islam known as Wahhabism that is taught in Saudi Arabia, and its effect on Muslim communities around the world. The wealthy nation has spent lavishly on religious outreach for half a century, spreading a view of Islam that many believe has helped to fuel global extremism. Yet Saudi leaders seek good relations with the West and see jihadist violence as a menace. “I’d be careful about blaming the Saudis,” said a former U. S. ambassador to Syria and Algeria. ______ 4. France’s highest administrative court has overturned a town’s ban on   burkinis, the   swimwear used by some Muslim women. The ruling applies only to   above, a seaside resort of about 14, 000, but means that bans enacted by other municipalities  —   there are at least 30 of them  —   could be similarly struck down if challenged in court. ______ 5. The U. S. Open begins Monday in New York, and much attention will be focused on whether the era of the Big Four in the men’s game is over. Roger Federer won’t be playing, Rafael Nadal is often coping with injuries and Novak Djokovic lost at Wimbledon. That leaves Andy Murray as the last of the establishment vanguard.

America’s new pharmaceutical villain is defending herself and her company from scrutiny over a sharp price increase on the lifesaving EpiPen. “I am running a business. I am a   business. I am not hiding from that,” said Heather Bresch, whose total compensation at Mylan has gone from about $2. 5 million to nearly $19 million during the same time the EpiPen’s price has risen fourfold. But Ms. Bresch moved quickly to reduce the    cost to patients after a public furor over the price increase, though the list price remains at about $600. ______ 8. Frank Ocean’s album release last weekend is delighting fans but also highlighting the tension between artists, record companies and streaming services. Mr. Ocean, above, apparently was able to cut his record company out of the profits for one of the year’s   albums by releasing “Blonde” a day after fulfilling his contractual agreement to the company with a separate “visual album. ” And Kanye West also made waves in the music world with the opening night of his “Saint Pablo” tour, performing the entire show on Thursday from floating platforms instead of a formal stage. ______ 9.

21471,Hillary Clinton Piles Up Research in Bid to Needle Donald Trump at First Debate - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy and Matt Flegenheimer,M,2016-08-31,2016.0,8.0,,"Hillary Clinton’s advisers are talking to Donald J. Trump’s ghostwriter of “The Art of the Deal,” seeking insights about Mr. Trump’s deepest insecurities as they devise strategies to needle and undermine him in four weeks at the first presidential debate, the most anticipated in a generation. Her team is also getting advice from psychology experts to help create a personality profile of Mr. Trump to gauge how he may respond to attacks and deal with a woman as his sole adversary on the debate stage. They are undertaking a   analysis of Mr. Trump’s performances in the Republican primary debates, cataloging strengths and weaknesses as well as trigger points that caused him to lash out in    ways. As Mrs. Clinton pores over this voluminous research with her debate team, most recently for several hours on Friday, and her aides continue searching for someone who can rattle her as a Trump   during mock debates, Mr. Trump is taking the opposite tack. Though he spent hours with his debate team the last two Sundays, the sessions were more freewheeling than focused, and he can barely conceal his disdain for laborious and theatrical practice sessions. “I believe you can prep too much for those things,” Mr. Trump said in an interview last week. “It can be dangerous. You can sound scripted or phony  —   like you’re trying to be someone you’re not. ” Rarely are debate preparations as illuminating about the candidates as a debate itself, but Mrs. Clinton’s and Mr. Trump’s strikingly different approaches to the Sept. 26   are more revealing about their egos and battlefield instincts than most other moments in the campaign. Mrs. Clinton, a deeply competitive debater, wants to crush Mr. Trump on live television, but not with an avalanche of policy details she is searching for ways to bait him into making blunders. Mr. Trump, a supremely confident communicator, wants viewers to see him as a   political outsider and trusts that he can box in Mrs. Clinton on her ethics and honesty. He has been especially resistant to his advisers’ suggestions that he take part in mock debates with a Clinton  . At their first session devoted to the debate, on Aug. 21 at Mr. Trump’s club in Bedminster, N. J. the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham was on hand to offer counsel and, if Mr. Trump was game, to play Mrs. Clinton, said Trump advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the debate preparations were supposed to be kept private. He declined. Instead, Mr. Trump asked a battery of questions about debate topics, Mrs. Clinton’s skills and possible moderators, but people close to him said relatively little had been accomplished. At that gathering, and another in Bedminster on Sunday without Ms. Ingraham, Mr. Trump was joined by Roger Ailes, who was ousted as Fox News chairman last month over accusations of sexual harassment. Mr. Trump, in the interview, said he saw little use in standing at lecterns and pretending to debate his opponent. “I know who I am, and it got me here,” Mr. Trump said, boasting of success in his 11 primary debate appearances and in capturing the Republican nomination over veteran politicians and polished debaters. “I don’t want to present a false front. I mean, it’s possible we’ll do a mock debate, but I don’t see a real need. ” Mr. Trump’s certitude  —   “I know how to handle Hillary,” he said  —   reflects his belief that the debates will be won or lost not on policy points and mastery of details, which are Mrs. Clinton’s strengths, but on the authenticity, boldness and leadership that the nominees demonstrate onstage. Mr. Trump is certain that he holds advantages here, saying Mrs. Clinton is likely to come across as a typical politician spouting rehearsed lines. For Mrs. Clinton, who can appear most at peace with a briefing book in her hand, there is no such thing as too much preparation. She met on Friday with key members of her debate team  —   the longtime Democratic operative Ron Klain, the Washington lawyer Karen Dunn and her senior strategist, Joel Benenson  —   and delved into the campaign’s extensive data on Mr. Trump and the likely questions and themes at the debate, according to two campaign advisers who requested anonymity to reveal internal campaign dynamics. In compiling research to help Mrs. Clinton prepare, her advisers have cast a wide net. They contacted Tony Schwartz, the “Art of the Deal”   to give them advice about Mr. Trump this summer  —   even though Mr. Schwartz’s   immersion in Mr. Trump’s life and homes ended in the  . But Clinton advisers said Mr. Schwartz and other writers who had observed Mr. Trump up close, as well as unnamed psychology experts they had spoken to, were critical to understanding how to get under Mr. Trump’s skin. These Clinton advisers agree with Mr. Trump’s belief that the debate will not be remembered as pitting a policy expert against a Washington outsider. Instead, her campaign is preparing ways for her to unnerve Mr. Trump and provoke him to rant and rave. The Clinton camp believes that Mr. Trump is most insecure about his intelligence, his net worth and his image as a successful businessman, and those are the areas they are working with Mrs. Clinton to target. Mr. Schwartz, in an interview, declined to comment about any conversations with the Clinton campaign, but he said Mr. Trump would be vulnerable if Mrs. Clinton proved to be calm, deliberate and relentless in attacking Mr. Trump’s character, volatility and readiness to be commander in chief. “Trump has severe attention problems and simply cannot take in complex information  —   he will be unable to practice for these debates,” said Mr. Schwartz, who was the subject of a New Yorker profile last month that portrayed Mr. Trump as a charlatan. “Trump will bring nothing but his bluster to the debates. He’ll use   language, he will repeat himself many times, he won’t complete sentences, and he won’t say anything of substance. ” “Even so,” Mr. Schwartz said, “Clinton has to be careful  —   she could get everything right and still potentially lose the debates if she comes off as too condescending, too much of a   . ” Mrs. Clinton’s advisers plan to have one person prepare extensively to play Mr. Trump in a series of mock   in the days before the first debate, which will be held at Hofstra University on Long Island. Mrs. Clinton’s team is also taking a hard look at her vulnerabilities. Even supporters have often questioned the clarity and wisdom of the campaign’s responses to uproars over Mrs. Clinton’s private email server and donations to the Clinton Foundation. There is hope that the debate stage will allow her a chance to at last address such questions with more brevity and less equivocation. The least comfortable task, though, will most likely be girding for personal attacks from Mr. Trump, who has shown an eagerness to resuscitate Clinton scandals  —   real and imagined  —   at virtually every opportunity. Allies have insisted that Mrs. Clinton will not shy away from preparing for the most painful insults, including a possible focus on her husband’s infidelities. “She knows that it’s coming,” said Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor and a member of Mrs. Clinton’s transition planning team. Mr. Trump said in the interview that he would “rather not” attack Mrs. Clinton on personal grounds, including Bill Clinton’s extramarital affairs. “If she hits me, though  —   you have to see what happens,” Mr. Trump said. It was this unpredictability that often made Mr. Trump an elusive target for fellow Republicans in the primary debates, and some close to Mrs. Clinton expressed concern that any false charges from Mr. Trump could rankle her. “This is a special challenge for Hillary, who is deeply rooted in the   world,” said Paul Begala, who helped prepare Mr. Clinton for debates in 1992 and 1996. “She is more wonk than pol, so she might be especially frustrated by a steady stream of invective, conspiracy theories and lies. ” Around the Clinton campaign, the question of whom to cast as Mr. Trump has become something of a running parlor game. Mrs. Clinton’s allies have floated several options: Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, who is from Queens, where Mr. Trump grew up James Carville, Mr. Clinton’s chief strategist in 1992, who has a gift for lacerating banter or Mark Cuban, another billionaire businessman. All three are viewed as unafraid to say some humiliating things to Mrs. Clinton’s face, as Mr. Trump may. At least a few old Clinton hands have suggested enlisting professional entertainers, like Jon Stewart or Alec Baldwin. Mr. Trump’s search so far seems to be less exhaustive: He said his daughter Ivanka could end up playing Mrs. Clinton. “Wouldn’t she be great at that?” Mr. Trump asked. “Maybe. ”"
21533,F.B.I. Papers Offer Closer Look at Hillary Clinton Email Inquiry - The New York Times,New York Times,Eric Lichtblau and Adam Goldman,M,2016-09-07,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   F. B. I. officials questioned Hillary Clinton extensively about her judgment in using her private email system to discuss classified drone strikes and in allowing aides to destroy large numbers of emails, before ultimately deciding she should not face criminal charges, according to investigative documents released Friday. The documents provided a number of new details about Mrs. Clinton’s private server, including what appeared to be a frantic effort by a computer specialist to delete an archive of her emails even after a congressional committee had requested they be preserved. In a   interview with the Justice Department’s top counterintelligence officials on July 2, Mrs. Clinton defended her handling of the private email system by repeatedly saying she had deferred to the judgment of her aides, an F. B. I. summary of the interview showed. Mrs. Clinton’s use of the private server has shadowed her presidential campaign for a year and a half. And the newly disclosed records, while largely reinforcing what had already been known about the F. B. I. investigation, provided Republicans more ammunition to attack the Democratic nominee’s judgment and honesty as she heads into the final,   Day phase of the campaign. Among the other key findings in the F. B. I. documents: ■ Mrs. Clinton regarded emails containing classified discussions about planned drone strikes as “routine. ” ■ She said she was either unaware of or misunderstood some classification procedures. ■ Colin L. Powell, a former secretary of state, had advised her to “be very careful” in how she used email. The F. B. I. documents show that an unnamed computer specialist deleted the archive of Mrs. Clinton’s emails weeks after the existence of the private server became public in March 2015. Days after The New York Times first reported that Mrs. Clinton had used a private email system exclusively as secretary of state, the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, asked that her emails be preserved and subpoenaed those that were related to the attacks. About three weeks later, however, the unnamed specialist “had an ‘oh shit’ moment” and realized that he had not destroyed an archive of emails that was supposed to have been deleted a year earlier, according to the F. B. I. report. The specialist then used a program known as BleachBit to delete an unknown number of emails, according to the report. Mrs. Clinton told investigators that she was unaware that the aide had deleted the emails. Dozens of times during her interview, Mrs. Clinton said she did not remember details about the server or guidance she had received on how to handle classified information. In its summary of the investigation, the F. B. I. said that Mrs. Clinton had emailed Colin Powell, a former secretary of state, a day after she was sworn in to office about Mr. Powell’s use of a personal email account when he was the country’s top diplomat. Mr. Powell warned Mrs. Clinton that if she used her BlackBerry for official business, those emails could become “official record[s] and subject to the law. ” Mr. Powell, apparently implying that he was cautious in his use of a personal email account, added: “Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data. ” According to the summary of her interview, Mrs. Clinton said that she did not know exactly what Mr. Powell was saying in that email and that his message “did not factor into her decision to use a personal email account. ” F. B. I. officials appear to have questioned Mrs. Clinton most aggressively about her judgment in using her private, unsecured system to get emails about how or where the Obama administration was planning to launch drone strikes against terrorism suspects, the documents indicated. The F. B. I. showed her one email after another containing information about possible drone strikes that was considered classified. But Mrs. Clinton appeared almost blasé in explaining her use of her private system to gather information on drone strikes. After being shown one email that was redacted from the public release of her emails, Mrs. Clinton “stated deliberation over a future drone strike did not give her cause for concern regarding classification,” according to the F. B. I. summary of the interview. “Clinton understood this type of conversation as part of the routine deliberation process,” the summary said. “Moreover, she recalled many conversations about future strikes that never occurred. ” Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, declined to comment. In a statement, her campaign said it was pleased that the F. B. I. had made the documents public. “While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case,” the campaign said. But Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said that the deletion of the emails violated an order his committee issued to Mrs. Clinton in 2012 and a subpoena issued by the Benghazi committee in 2015. He said he planned to seek answers from Mrs. Clinton about the deletions. “These were not Hillary Clinton’s emails  —   they were government records, and this was potentially one of the largest security breaches at the State Department because they had all these years of security records that just went out the door,” Mr. Chaffetz said. “It’s a very    order. There’s no wiggle room. ” Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, called the F. B. I. documents “a devastating indictment of her judgment, honesty and basic competency. ” The F. B. I. released only small portions of its thick files on the Clinton investigation, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the F. B. I. of withholding key documents  —   including many unclassified ones  —   from public view. The selective release, he said, produced “an incomplete and possibly misleading picture of the facts without the other unclassified information that is still locked away from the public and even most congressional staff. ” Mrs. Clinton told F. B. I. investigators that she had used a personal email server “out of convenience” and did not remember anyone raising legal concerns about the practice. She also said that she “did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,” the F. B. I. documents say. “She relied on State officials to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address,” they say. The document summarizing Mrs. Clinton’s interview, known in the F. B. I. as a 302 report, runs only a dozen pages. The memorandum on the investigation is lengthier, and goes into greater detail about aspects of the case. The materials were presumably provided to James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, who later decided to not recommend charges in the case. A senior law enforcement official said the interview at F. B. I. headquarters had been intended “to fill the gaps” of what the F. B. I. did not know about why Mrs. Clinton used a private email server. Both documents were partly redacted, which slowed their release as the bureau sought to protect some information while satisfying the public’s right to know. The documents offer the most detailed account of Mrs. Clinton’s role from the bureau’s yearlong investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by using a private system  —   clintonemail. com  —   to send tens of thousands of emails about government business, including classified matters."

21567,"On Labor Day, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Begin a Final Sprint - The New York Times",New York Times,Ashley Parker,F,2016-09-06,2016.0,9.0,,"CLEVELAND  —   Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump ran virtually parallel campaigns on Monday as they geared up for the final stretch of the presidential race. She made nice with the news media by opening up her campaign plane and chatting with reporters. He followed suit, inviting a smaller group of reporters onto his plane and answering questions during the   flight. She took along her running mate, and so did he, as both focused on Ohio and nearly crossed paths in Cleveland. Their motorcades all but passed each other, and all four candidates’ planes ended up on the tarmac at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport at the same time. Mrs. Clinton moved on several fronts on Monday to confront nagging doubts about her candidacy, despite her comfortable lead in many   polls. Courting labor supporters, she met with union leaders in Cleveland while her husband, Bill Clinton, appeared at a Labor Day parade in Detroit. Seeking the backing of progressive voters, she enlisted her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who made his first solo appearance on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf at a rally in New Hampshire. And her outreach to reporters included her most extensive    session with them in months. She expressed alarm “about the credible reports about Russian government interference in our elections” through hacking, saying, “We’ve never had a foreign adversarial power be already involved in our electoral process. ” Not to be outdone, Mr. Trump used his airborne meeting with reporters to clarify his views on immigration, saying he opposed any path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. But he did not explicitly rule out a   path to legal status if the nation’s immigration system is overhauled. “We’re going to make that decision into the future,” Mr. Trump said. But, he added, “to become a citizen, you are going to have to go out and come back in through the process. You’re going to have to go out and get in line. This isn’t touchback. You have to get in line. ” On the plane, Mr. Trump also told reporters that, “as of this moment,” he planned to attend all three debates, and that only a “natural disaster” could make him change his mind. He added that, while he was preparing, he was not holding mock debate sessions. Labor Day is traditionally the beginning of a   sprint to Election Day, in which candidates try to seize voters’ attention as summer fades and debates loom. Monday was no exception. The visits to Ohio by Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton  —   along with their respective running mates, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia  —   highlighted the importance of a state that Republicans believe Mr. Trump must win to have any shot of reaching the White House. “Labor Day comes, and it’s kind of like a recalibration,” said Beth Myers, who managed Mitt Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign and served as his senior adviser in 2012. “You see the finish line, you see that there’s not too many   events left, and most campaigns take a measure of where you are on Labor Day. ” This cycle, however, both candidates have eschewed traditional campaigning, albeit in divergent ways. Normally, they would already have been circling each other in swing states. But Mrs. Clinton has spent most of the summer away from the campaign trail, focusing on   in places like the Hamptons and Beverly Hills with celebrities like Jimmy Buffett and Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Trump has also kept a languid pace, favoring large rallies, often in the evening, over several daily stops. Mr. Trump, a political novice, and Mrs. Clinton, a veteran politician, are confronting historically low approval ratings among voters for whom they are   commodities. “Labor Day used to be this big, important marker in the campaign season,” said Amy Walter, the national editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “A kickoff, if you will. Today, it feels like the start of the third quarter instead of the kickoff. ” “The candidates are   the ads have been running for months and TVs have been saturated with talking heads,” she added. Mr. Trump tried to burnish his image as a statesman last week with a hastily arranged trip to Mexico City. He has also tried to increase his outreach to minorities, from a promised “softening” on immigration that concluded with a fiery, nativist speech in Phoenix, to a stop at a black church in Detroit. That approach was also on display on Monday. At a diner in Cleveland, Mr. Trump met Maria Hernandez, a   who said she was supporting him. “  supports Trump,” he said. “It’s so nice. ” Then he turned to the nearby reporters to emphasize his focus group of one: “Make a note of it, guys,” he said. Earlier, speaking to a dozen white men and a lone white woman at an American Legion post here, Mr. Trump criticized China’s treatment of President Obama: When the president landed in Hangzhou for the Group of 20 summit meeting, the host country forced him to disembark from the plane’s belly. Mr. Trump said he would not have gotten off the plane, but instead would have urged his crew to “get out of here. ” Mrs. Clinton’s appearance in Cleveland was meant as a show of labor support during a campaign in which many    union members were drawn to Mr. Sanders’s promise to take on income inequality. At a Labor Day festival here, she and Mr. Kaine were joined by the A. F. L. . I. O. ’s president, Richard L. Trumka Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the first unions to endorse Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton’s surrogates were also out in force. In Pittsburgh, Mr. Kaine and the man he hopes to succeed, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke at a rally before the city’s Labor Day parade. Mr. Kaine assailed Mr. Trump for refusing to release his tax returns, then turned the stage over to Mr. Biden. “My name is Joe Biden, and I work for Hillary Clinton and whatever the hell this guy’s name is,” he said. Mr. Sanders, at a rally in Lebanon, N. H. praised Mrs. Clinton for supporting a host of progressive positions. “I would hope and ask you all, very much, that we have got to do everything we can to make sure that Hillary Clinton is elected president,” he said. “But two days after the election, we have got to continue the pressure. ” Addressing an issue that has dogged the campaign, Mr. Clinton defended the Clinton Foundation. And he criticized Mr. Trump over his own foundation, referring to a Washington Post report that found that his charitable organization paid the Internal Revenue Service a $2, 500 penalty this year after improperly giving a political contribution to a campaign group with ties to the attorney general of Florida, Pam Bondi. Mr. Trump discussed the issue in his talk with reporters aboard his plane. He denied any impropriety on either his part or Ms. Bondi’s concerning the $25, 000 donation. At the time of the donation in 2013, Ms. Bondi was considering whether to investigate Trump University for fraud. In the end, she did not do so. “I never spoke to her, first of all, she’s a fine person beyond reproach,” he said when asked about the controversy. “I never even spoke to her about it at all. She’s a fine person. Never spoken to her about it. Never. ” Many attorneys general besides Ms. Bondi, he said, decided against pursuing any action regarding Trump University. “I’ll win that case in court,” he said. “Many turned that down. ” “I never spoke to her,” he added, again referring to Ms. Bondi. When asked what he expected to get out of the donation, he would only say: “I’ve just known Pam Bondi for years. I have a lot of respect for her. Never spoke to her about that at all. I just have a lot of respect for her, and she’s very popular. ”"
21569,"Young Blacks Voice Skepticism on Hillary Clinton, Worrying Democrats - The New York Times",New York Times,Jonathan Martin,M,2016-09-06,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   When a handful of liberal advocacy organizations convened a series of focus groups with young black voters last month, the assessments of Donald J. Trump were predictably unsparing. But when the participants were asked about Hillary Clinton, their appraisals were just as blunt and nearly as biting. “What am I supposed to do if I don’t like him and I don’t trust her?” a millennial black woman in Ohio asked. “Choose between being stabbed and being shot? No way!” “She was part of the whole problem that started sending blacks to jail,” a young black man, also from Ohio, observed about Mrs. Clinton. “He’s a racist, and she is a liar, so really what’s the difference in choosing both or choosing neither?” another young black woman from Ohio said. Young   like all voters their age, are typically far harder to drive to the polls than   and older Americans. Yet with just over two months until Election Day, many Democrats are expressing alarm at the lack of enthusiasm, and in some cases outright resistance, some black millennials feel toward Mrs. Clinton. Their skepticism is rooted in a deep discomfort with the political establishment that they believe the    former first lady and secretary of state represents. They share a lingering mistrust of Mrs. Clinton and her husband over criminal justice issues. They are demanding more from politicians as part of a new, confrontational wave of black activism that has arisen in response to police killings of unarmed  . “We’re in the midst of a movement with a real sense of urgency,” explained Brittany Packnett, 31, a St.   leader in the push for police accountability. Mrs. Clinton is not yet connecting, she said, “because the conversation that younger black voters are having is no longer one about settling on a candidate who is better than the alternative. ” The question of just how many young   will show up to vote carries profound implications for this election. Mrs. Clinton is sure to dominate Mr. Trump among black voters, but her overwhelming margin could ultimately matter less than the total number of blacks who show up to vote. To replicate President Obama’s success in crucial states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, she cannot afford to let the percentage of the electorate that is black slip far below what it was in 2012. And while a modest   of black votes may not imperil Mrs. Clinton’s prospects, given Mr. Trump’s unpopularity among upscale white voters, it could undermine Democrats’ effort to capture control of the Senate and win other   elections. Mrs. Clinton’s difficulties with young   were laid bare in four focus groups conducted in Cleveland and Jacksonville, Fla. for a handful of progressive organizations spending millions on the election: the service employees union, a joint “super PAC” between organized labor and the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, and a progressive group called Project New America. The results were outlined in a   presentation by Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster, and shared with The New York Times by another party strategist who wanted to draw attention to Mrs. Clinton’s difficulties in hopes that the campaign would move more aggressively to address the matter. Word of the report has spread in the constellation of liberal operatives and advocacy groups in recent weeks, concerning officials who saw diminished black turnout hurt Democratic candidates in the last two midterm elections. Adding to the worries is a separate poll of   that Mr. Belcher conducted earlier in the summer indicating that Mrs. Clinton is lagging well behind Mr. Obama’s performance among young blacks in a handful of crucial states. In Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, 70 percent of   under 35 said they were backing Mrs. Clinton, 8 percent indicated support for Mr. Trump and 18 percent said they were backing another candidate or did not know whom they would support. In 2012, Mr. Obama won 92 percent of black voters under 45 nationally, according to exit polling. Over 25 percent of   are between 18 and 34, and 44 percent are older than 35, according to 2013 census data. “There is no Democratic majority without these voters,” Mr. Belcher said. “The danger is that if you don’t get these voters out, you’ve got the 2004 John Kerry electorate again. ” In Ohio, for example, blacks were 10 percent of the electorate in the 2004 presidential race. But when Mr. Obama ran for   in 2012, that number jumped to 15 percent. What frustrates many blacks under 40 is Mrs. Clinton’s overriding focus on Mr. Trump. “We already know what the deal is with Trump,” said Nathan Baskerville, a    North Carolina state representative. “Tell us what your plan is to make our life better. ” Such talk can be frustrating to Mrs. Clinton’s aides, who point out that her first speech of the campaign was on criminal justice and that she has laid out a series of proposals on the topic. “It is on us to make sure that that’s known,” said Addisu Demissie, Mrs. Clinton’s voter outreach and mobilization director, adding of young black activists, “We share their goals, we share their values and we want to make sure that’s reflected through our campaign. ” The focus groups and interviews with young black activists suggest many of them are not aware of Mrs. Clinton’s plans regarding police conduct, mass incarceration and structural racism broadly. Christopher Prudhome, 31, recounted a recurring conversation he has with other   as he travels around the country as the head of a nonpartisan group dedicated to registering young voters: They do not like either candidate. “Young people feel discouraged and apprehensive about the political process as is, and then they look at the two options in front of us,” said Mr. Prudhome, adding of Mrs. Clinton: “Nobody has seen an agenda for   millennials. I don’t think they believe she cares about them. ” Part of Mrs. Clinton’s problem, said Symone Sanders, a former top aide to Senator Bernie Sanders’s campaign, is that the candidate is overly cautious and is conducting an outdated style of black outreach. Ms. Sanders has begun taking matters into her own hands. She said she was working with other young activists to recruit black celebrities for a millennial mobilization tour through Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. “Black churches and an H. B. C. U. tour is just not going to cut it in 2016,” said Ms. Sanders, referring to historically black colleges and universities. “The Clinton campaign has to be willing to get out of what’s comfortable and get on the streets. ” Mr. Demissie said the Clinton campaign’s efforts were more expansive, pointing to voter registration efforts already underway in barbershops and salons as well as sneaker and video game stores. Mrs. Clinton has met with mothers of those who lost children at the hands of the police and has used the signature refrain that “black lives matter” in public remarks. But she and her husband also come from an earlier political tradition rooted in the Deep South, where black voters are primarily reached through the church and the threat of white conservative backlash is never far from mind. Today’s young   voters are less likely to be found in black churches and more likely to be found in schools, loosely organized activist groups and online, said Ms. Packnett, the St. Louis activist. And the leaders are more diverse. “It’s not just heterosexual men,” she noted. Not only are younger black activists reached in different ways, they also have far higher expectations on leaders, dismissing boilerplate pleas for racial equality and justice as insufficient. “Gone is the day of patience,” said Tony J. Payton Jr. 35, a former Pennsylvania state representative. “No longer should we accept systemic racism. ” Doubts about how aggressively Mrs. Clinton will move to combat racism are at the heart of black suspicion toward her. Some   said her 1996 reference to some young criminals as “” and the legislation that President Bill Clinton signed imposing stiff sentences on nonviolent offenders, have made today’s activists skeptical about her true intentions. “That stuff comes up unprompted,” Mr. Belcher said. Mr. Trump has turned to remarkably blunt language about blacks in recent weeks  —   portraying their communities as dystopian hellscapes and asking them, in courting their support, “What do you have to lose?” Some   allies of Mrs. Clinton believe he is serving as her most effective     lever. “He is literally saying something every day that is disrespectful to the black community,” said Michael Blake, a New York State assemblyman from the Bronx who worked on Mr. Obama’s campaigns and is close to many Clinton aides. Yet when   voters in the focus groups were shown campaign fliers and asked to rate them, there was no mistaking what was most effective. A pamphlet with a picture of Mr. Trump that read, “We have to beat the racists,” fell flat with young black audiences. Scoring much higher were a stark black and white handout showing the names of those killed at the hands of the police and another with images of mothers of the victims that said, “Their Children Can’t Vote, Will You?”"
21595,Hillary Clinton’s Lead Has Shrunk: How to Assess the Polls - The New York Times,New York Times,Nate Cohn,M,2016-09-08,2016.0,9.0,,"The presidential race has become a lot less clear over the last few weeks. Back in   Hillary Clinton held a large lead over Donald J. Trump. Since then, her lead has slipped  —   but how far isn’t so obvious. The various forecasting models and polling averages have split about as much as they have all year. What’s going on? In   Mrs. Clinton led by around eight percentage points in national polling. Since then, there hasn’t been much evidence to confirm that large margin. Yes, there have been a few polls showing her leading by a big amount. Monmouth, Quinnipiac and USA   polls all showed her up by at least seven points nationwide. But note that over the last two weeks there really hasn’t been any indication that Mrs. Clinton was up by, say, double digits. If she were still up by eight points, we would expect at least some data showing her posting huge margins. In contrast, plenty of recent polls show a much tighter race. Many are less reputable, including online and automated polls of dubious methodological quality or with limited or no track records. But there have been   polls with a smaller lead for Mrs. Clinton, and even the   poll this week that showed her down by two points among likely voters. A few weeks ago, there weren’t many polls of any kind showing her in that weak a position. Gallup’s daily tracking poll  —   another   measure  —   also showed Mrs. Clinton’s favorability ratings slipping over the second half of August, which has tended to track with changes in her overall standing in national polls. The battleground state polling  —   even the   polls  —   also shows a tighter race. Recent Marquette, Monmouth and Suffolk polls in Wisconsin and Michigan showed Mrs. Clinton with a modest lead, not the   edge she had a month ago. All considered, the balance of evidence plainly indicates that Mrs. Clinton has lost ground since  . Whether she’s up by two or five points is another question. But it’s definitely not seven or eight anymore. Exactly where you peg her lead  —   two points or six points or somewhere else  —   is a lot hazier than usual. The differences are reflected in the big splits between the various polling averages and models, like at The Huffington Post or FiveThirtyEight. Part of the issue is that there haven’t been many   polls recently, and most (though not all) of the   surveys have shown Mrs. Clinton with a comfortable lead, as FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten pointed out last week. On the other hand, the online and automated polls have shown a much more significant tightening of the race. The always noisy Reuters poll has shown a big decline in Mrs. Clinton’s support, and many of its new state polls have shown the same thing. So has Morning Consult, a new online pollster. A wave of polls from Emerson College, which does not contact cellphones, showed Mrs. Clinton with only a nominal edge in the battleground states. The Los Angeles  . S. C. panel, which differs in a number of respects from other surveys, gives Mr. Trump a lead. Whether a polling average or model includes all of this data or some of it, or has the means to correct for including polls that systematically favor one candidate or another, might be a bigger issue now than it was a month ago. Another issue is that the   polls have given readers the opportunity to choose their own adventure, depending on what type of question they look at. A recent Fox poll, for instance, showed Mrs. Clinton ahead by just two points. But it showed her ahead by six points in the    matchup, without Jill Stein or Gary Johnson listed as candidates. The   poll showed Mrs. Clinton trailing among likely voters but ahead among registered voters. These big gaps between registered and likely voters, and the   and   ballots, haven’t been the norm so far this year. There’s no “right” answer about which is more reliable. I happen to prefer to look at samples of registered voters  —   a larger sample, and I can mentally apply a slight and consistent   penalty to the Democrats  —   but I know that generally the   numbers are more accurate. I’m agnostic about whether the   or   polls are better in this particular election, since Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein blur the line between candidates who deserve inclusion and those who do not. Most of the forecasting models and polling averages use the   race and   polls. Right now, those may offer a particularly pessimistic picture for Mrs. Clinton. Late August is not a great time of year for polling, and Labor Day weekend is probably the worst of all. The news can slow down in August, and so can public interest in the race. People go on vacation. News media organizations that spent tens of thousands of dollars polling around the period of the conventions take some time off and wait to   the fray in September. Over the next few weeks, a lot of these questions are going to sort themselves out. There will be a new wave of   polls. Many will add   screens for the first time. And not only will we have more new polls, but we’ll also be even closer to the election  —   and entering a period when the polls tend to be quite predictive of the eventual outcome."

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump continued to battle it out, making sequential   appearances at a forum on national security. Ahead of the event, Mr. Trump proposed ending caps on military spending. Both candidates lay claim to major backing from the military. If you feel whipsawed by polls that seem uncertain about how much Mr. Trump has gained on Mrs. Clinton, one of our   experts explains the fluctuations and reassures us that   polls over the next few weeks are likely to be highly predictive. _____ 2. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter lashed out at Russia, which the F. B. I. believes hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s computer systems. In a speech at Oxford University, he accused Vladimir Putin’s government of demonstrating a “clear ambition to erode” international order and warned that the U. S. “will not ignore attempts to interfere with our democratic processes. ” Above, the secretary last month. _____ 3. Win or lose in November, Donald Trump is coming to Pennsylvania Avenue. The Trump International Hotel, Washington D. C. will bring   service and stratospheric prices to the historic Old Post Office, six blocks from the White House. But it’s also as polarizing as many other aspects of Mr. Trump. The preservationist architect on the project, who resigned last year over differences, said, “He does not deserve this building. ” _____ 4. Apple announced a range of updates and improvements across its full line at its annual product showcase, but the big focus was the new iPhone 7. Its lack of a headphone jack means the device can be   (oh be joyful) the company can sell wireless earbuds (ouch, $160) and the future looks a lot less like a tangle of wires. Our tech columnist sees a telling lack of dazzle. _____ 5. The Paralympic Games opened in Rio. Some 4, 300 athletes representing 161 nations and a team representing the world’s refugees will compete over the next 10 days. Shortfalls in ticket sales and sponsorships forced cuts in the number of workers, transportation options and sports venues, but not the number of events (live streaming on TeamUSA. org). _____ 6. At the U. S. Open, it’s the last of the quarterfinals. Kei Nishikori beat Andy Murray, so he’ll face the winner of tonight’s match between Stan Wawrinka and Juan Martin del Potro.

New details emerged of Edward Snowden’s path after he fled the U. S. in 2013 with details of how the National Security Agency’s vast program of surveillance had swept in millions of Americans. Four men and women, all asylum seekers and clients of one of Mr. Snowden’s Hong Kong lawyers, spoke of harboring him in cramped apartments in poor districts. One said she didn’t know who he was until she bought him a paper. “Oh my God, unbelievable,” she recalled saying to herself. “The most wanted man in the world is in my house. ” _____ 10. Finally, a veteran of a World War   unit of female pilots was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Elaine Harmon, who died last year at the age of 95, served with the Women Airforce Service Pilots, who performed many flying tasks, some in great danger, to free male pilots for combat. The role is now congressionally recognized as warranting the honor of burial at Arlington.

21627,Did Hillary Clinton Have to Be First? - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael Barbaro,M,2016-09-10,2016.0,9.0,,"Did Hillary Clinton, or somebody very much like her, have to be the first woman to get this close to winning the presidency? We explore that question in the latest episode of The   with Claire McCaskill, the senior United States Senator from Missouri, and Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist who has written several books on women’s history. What   combination of factors is required for a country to embrace a woman as its leader for the first time? Longtime public exposure? Proximity to power? Moderate politics? And how powerful, perhaps even necessary, is it that this first woman be the spouse of a former president? History offers a guide: The first female president of any country was Isabel Martínez de Perón of Argentina, the wife of its former president. The first woman elected to the United States Senate, Hattie Wyatt Caraway, was the widow of a senator. And now the United States has the first woman candidate in the general election. “Given our history it’s not surprising it’s the wife of somebody who had the job first,” Ms. Collins said. “Some day we’ll have some really charismatic woman who gets people all excited, and it doesn’t matter that she’s only been in the senate for two years and that we don’t know much about her except her story,” Ms. Collins said. Mrs. Clinton’s presidential runs will have paved the way for that woman to have a shot. “No matter what happens in this election, one of the great contributions Hillary Clinton has made to American history is that she made it seem sort of normal to have a woman running for president in 2008,” Ms. Collins said. “Before then it had never been a normal thing. ” America is behind many other countries on that front, as Senator McCaskill pointed out. “Many of us are painfully aware of how many countries around the world have elected and admired women executives in their government, and it is embarrassing to many of us that America has not taken that step,” she said. “The irony is that everyone always would pat women on the head and say ‘well you know as soon as a woman is qualified there will be a woman president,’ ” Senator McCaskill said. “Now we have a stark differential in qualifications, and now it seems to be all about her integrity and how likable she is. ” In the episode, we discuss the challenges of running against a woman with former Representative Rick Lazio of Long Island, a man who discovered those pitfalls in a very public fashion. In 2000, he was Mrs. Clinton’s opponent in the race for the United States Senate seat in New York. In a   debate moment, Mr. Lazio approached Mrs. Clinton’s podium to ask her to sign a pledge, a tactic many saw as an overly aggressive male gesture toward a female rival. Mr. Lazio told us it was a mistake that he still regrets  —   and one whose visual impact he underestimated in the moment. “Our folks all thought we had won the debate hands down,” he told us. But the next day, he saw that clip played over and over again and realized that the moment was going to stick. “The mistake that I made  —   and it was a mistake  —   was to create an optic where it looked like I was somebody other than who I was it looked like I was invading her space and was not chivalrous,” he told us. “It was spun in the media and shown over and over again, and it looked like it was an overbearing male approaching a female. ” Please let us know what you think of The  .

21664,Donald Trump Seizes Hillary Clinton’s Absence to Press His Case - The New York Times,New York Times,Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman,B,2016-09-13,2016.0,9.0,,"Donald J. Trump hurled himself into a new effort to reshape the presidential race on Monday, scrambling to allay voters’ concerns about his temperament and put Hillary Clinton on the defensive over her critical comments about many of Mr. Trump’s supporters. Though Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has largely withheld comment about Mrs. Clinton’s health, showing uncharacteristic restraint after her campaign announced she had pneumonia, he took Mrs. Clinton’s unexpected absence from public view as an opportunity to press his case with ferocity. Among Mr. Trump’s advisers, there is a sense of urgency. With eight weeks left in the race  —   and just two before his first debate with Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee  —   Mr. Trump may never again have such a window to make his argument to voters more or less uninterrupted. Without a forceful message and iron discipline heading into the debates, Mr. Trump could struggle mightily to overcome the deeply rooted opposition to his candidacy. An ABC   Post poll published over the weekend showed Mrs. Clinton with a    edge over Mr. Trump nationally, with six in 10 voters describing Mr. Trump as unqualified and biased against women and minorities. Mr. Trump seized the chance on Monday to turn the charge of intolerance against Mrs. Clinton: Denouncing the allegation that his supporters were bigoted, Mr. Trump argued in a speech in Baltimore that Mrs. Clinton had shown “contempt” for voters by deriding many of his supporters as racist and sexist, calling them a “basket of deplorables” at a   on Friday. At a rally on Monday night in North Carolina, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was running a “  and negative campaign. ” The Trump campaign also announced the support of R. James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, to reassure voters of Mr. Trump’s readiness for the presidency. Mr. Trump made no mention of Mrs. Clinton’s health in his campaign speeches. During two television interviews on Monday morning, he said he wished Mrs. Clinton well. He also did not revive his frequent accusation that Mrs. Clinton lacks the physical strength to be president, though he suggested vaguely that “something is going on. ” Instead, he used a speech to the National Guard Association of the United States to defend his supporters at length, arguing that they were right to be concerned about border security and crime, and that those concerns did not indicate a hateful view of racial and religious minorities. “If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don’t see how she can credibly campaign any further,” Mr. Trump said, demanding an apology. He claimed that his campaign was doing “amazingly well with   and Hispanic workers. ” But Mr. Trump, who records little support in the polls among racial minorities and educated whites, did not address any of the past remarks that have contributed to his low standing with those groups. He has continued to call for a crackdown on immigrants who are in the country illegally, and has declined to retract his false assertions in the past that President Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Trump has also not expressed regret for clashing with the family of a slain Muslim Army captain or renounced his proposal to bar Muslims from entering the country. Mrs. Clinton has rebuked Mr. Trump over the last month for what she has called his promotion of racially insensitive messages and policies and his alignment with leaders of the movement known as the “” which is widely seen as holding fringe and racist views. Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster, said that Mr. Trump appeared to be recovering his footing in the race, but that it might be too late for him to change many voters’ longstanding assessment of his character and capabilities. “Hillary Clinton clearly won the summer, and there’s little doubt Donald Trump dug himself a very deep hole in the aftermath of the nominating conventions,” Mr. Blizzard said. “While Trump is starting to climb out of that hole now, his ability to take advantage of a few bad weeks for Clinton is going to be limited due to enduring views about his judgment, his temperament and his rhetoric toward other ethnicities and women. ” And Democrats are skeptical that Mr. Trump will be able to reinvent himself by using Mrs. Clinton’s biting comments as a shield. Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who advises a   “super PAC,” described an exercise he uses in focus groups, asking voters to write down three words to describe Mr. Trump before the discussion begins. “People use the word ‘racist’ consistently to describe him,” Mr. Garin said. “But they also talk about him as a dangerous egomaniac. ” Still, on a conference call with top supporters Monday, advisers to Mr. Trump spoke of Mrs. Clinton’s turbulent stretch as a source of relief: For the first time in a while, they said, they were starting the week on offense, according to people who participated in the call who spoke on condition of anonymity about a private discussion. Campaign surrogates were told to hammer Mrs. Clinton for her description of Trump voters, and to say as little as possible about her pneumonia diagnosis. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army officer who advises Mr. Trump, said there was optimism in the campaign that the momentum of the race had “totally shifted in Mr. Trump’s favor. ” He predicted that voters would see a distinction between “a guy who made all kinds of comments as he was fighting to win the primaries” and the Donald Trump of the general election. Mr. Trump has taken other steps in recent days to steady his candidacy, moving to shore up his campaign in crucial swing states. With Mrs. Clinton holding a daunting advantage on the Electoral College map, Mr. Trump aimed a new television campaign at the four most critical states for his candidacy: Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. He has given his aides greater leeway in directing his television advertising, allowing the campaign to focus on that smaller cluster of states, a change from as recently as two weeks ago, when Mr. Trump was personally choosing where to run television ads, according to two people briefed on the Trump operation. Mr. Trump also removed the head of his Florida operation last week, replacing her with Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican operative close to Gov. Rick Scott. And Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, who is still a trusted adviser, has visited New Hampshire in recent weeks, meeting with senior Republicans there and making suggestions on spending and strategy decisions in the state, two people familiar with his activities said. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump and his allies can maintain this level of determined focus. Numerous times, Mr. Trump has briefly adopted a more disciplined pose on the campaign trail, only to give in quickly to the temptation to taunt and brawl. Even on Monday morning, as he refrained from taunting Mrs. Clinton in a television interview, Mr. Trump made an offhand reference to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as “Pocahontas. ” Ms. Warren, a Democrat, has described herself as having Native American heritage. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers have suggested in the past that Mrs. Clinton’s health should be fair game. Blaise Ingoglia, the chairman of the Florida Republican Party, said he considered Mrs. Clinton’s handling of her health a legitimate campaign issue because she did not immediately disclose that she had pneumonia. “The disturbing part of that whole thing is that the campaign is willing to conceal that instead of being up front and honest,” he said. “You really start to question: What else is being concealed?”"
21665,Scrutiny of Hillary Clinton’s Health Puts New Focus on Tim Kaine - The New York Times,New York Times,Thomas Kaplan,M,2016-09-13,2016.0,9.0,,"DAYTON, Ohio  —   When Hillary Clinton was searching for a running mate, she made clear her top criterion: Her selection needed to be ready to become president “if something were to happen,” as she put it. When she announced Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her choice, Mrs. Clinton affirmed that he had passed that test. Now, after Mrs. Clinton had to be helped into a van while departing a Sept. 11 anniversary ceremony on Sunday and the later disclosure that she had been given a pneumonia diagnosis on Friday, Mr. Kaine is coming under a more intense spotlight. When he took questions from reporters on Monday, cable news channels carried the exchange live, a rare level of attention for his candidacy. While everyone  —   politicians included  —   gets sick from time to time, the intense focus on Mrs. Clinton’s health brings with it a constitutional reminder: Mr. Kaine is not only a   booster, but also a possible president himself. The scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton’s health “means that Tim Kaine has to step up his game,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “He’s such an unknown quantity to the American people that he now has to kind of assume the mantle of what it would be like to have him as commander in chief, not just vice president,” Mr. Brinkley said. Nine vice presidents have assumed the presidency during a president’s term, eight because of a death and one because of a resignation. In four of those eight instances, the president was assassinated. In four other cases, the president died of natural causes, most recently in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage and Harry S. Truman became president. A lawyer by training, Mr. Kaine, who served as mayor of Richmond, Va. and as Virginia’s lieutenant governor and governor before winning election to the Senate in 2012, was seen as an appealing pick for Mrs. Clinton in large part because of his résumé and his policy chops. But he is not a   figure nationally, even after more than seven weeks as Mrs. Clinton’s running mate. In a   poll conducted this month, 19 percent of voters said they had never heard of Mr. Kaine, and an additional 21 percent said they had no opinion of him. “So far this has been a presidential race that has been heavily focused on the presidential candidates, to an unusual extent,” said Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University who is an expert on the vice presidency. Recalling his own bout with pneumonia, Mr. Goldstein cautioned that “the fact that somebody has pneumonia doesn’t mean there’s about to be a succession. ” But he said the episode on Sunday would bring more attention to Mr. Kaine’s suitability to the presidency. “It should remind people of the importance of the two   candidates, and whether they are appropriate presidential successors based on their experience, skill, character and substantive views,” he said. As he hopscotches from state to state, Mr. Kaine comes across more as a genial traveling salesman for the   ticket than as a president in waiting. In his speeches, he tends to focus on making a case against Donald J. Trump while talking up Mrs. Clinton. At times, he still expresses shock that he is even on the Democratic ticket, as if he had been plucked from anonymity to embark upon a great adventure. “I felt like I was Pinocchio turning into a real boy,” he told a crowd in Virginia on Friday, recalling when Mrs. Clinton asked him to be her running mate. “I mean, like, ‘Wow, what? You want me? Are you kidding? ’” The biggest test of Mr. Kaine’s readiness will come on Oct. 4, when he faces Mr. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, in the   debate. “You don’t want a Sarah Palin situation where voters really have doubts about the second person on the ticket,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. “It’s especially true if there are any kinds of concerns about age or health. ” Mr. Kaine, 58, differs from the man he is hoping to succeed, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in that he is a relatively new member of the Senate, not an elder statesman. But Mr. Kaine has made a point of focusing on foreign policy during his time in the Senate, where he serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees. Speaking to reporters after an event here on Monday, Mr. Kaine said he did not think the new episode involving Mrs. Clinton’s health put any more pressure on him to convince voters he is ready to be president. Even before the latest incident, Mr. Kaine had tried to defend Mrs. Clinton against questions about her health, while also calling on Mr. Trump, who had accused Mrs. Clinton of lacking stamina, to be more forthcoming about his own health. Two weeks ago, Mr. Kaine mocked the letter from a doctor for Mr. Trump that asserted the candidate would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” while he also declared Mrs. Clinton to be “one tough and one healthy person. ” And as he campaigned here on Monday, he offered fresh testimony about Mrs. Clinton’s physical  . “I’ve just been on the campaign since July 22,” Mr. Kaine told the crowd. “Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months. Her energy staggers me. I have a hard time keeping up with her. ”"
21709,"Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Edward Snowden: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",New York Times,Andrea Kannapell and Sandra Stevenson,F,2016-09-16,2016.0,9.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A New York   News poll shows a tightened presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, two of the most unpopular candidates on record. Mrs. Clinton claims the support of 46 percent of likely voters nationwide, to Mr. Trump’s 44 percent. But differences at the state level suggest Mrs. Clinton still has a strong advantage. The Libertarian and Green Party candidates, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, remain in the single digits but could have an outsize effect on the outcome. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton resumed campaigning after a   break to recuperate from pneumonia. “People like me, we’re lucky,” she told an audience at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro. “When I’m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can’t. ” Mr. Trump unveiled a jobs plan that was short on details, though it did include the pledge to make allies pay the full cost of U. S. military resources used for their defense. Donald Trump Jr. came under fire for invoking Holocaust imagery in complaining about media double standards. If the Republicans did what Democrats were doing, he said, “they’d be warming up the gas chamber. ” _____ 3.  The   National Museum of African American History and Culture opens next week, filling the last museum site on the National Mall. The history begins with slavery in Africa and moves to the Americas, with a welter of piercing objects, like a   lockable neck ring. The collection, which ranges from Harriet Tubman’s missal to Chuck Berry’s red Cadillac, “is a   engrossing,   ” our critic writes. _____ 4. One of our most popular stories today is actually a short video narrated by Shawn Carter, better known as Jay Z. It’s a compelling, speedy recap of the U. S. fight against drugs going back to the Nixon administration, pointing out how   have been disproportionately targeted and penalized. “The war on drugs is an epic fail,” he concludes. _____ 5. The Philippines is struggling through its own devastating war on drugs. Its Senate heard explosive testimony from a   hit man who said that the country’s new president, Rodrigo Duterte, had presided over the extrajudicial killings of about 1, 000 criminals and political opponents over the years he served as mayor of Davao City. The Senate’s televised hearings have already heard that nearly 1, 800 people were killed by police officers and vigilantes in the war on drugs in Mr. Duterte’s first seven weeks as president. _____ 6.  Oliver Stone’s “Snowden” opens nationwide on Friday. Our reviewer calls it “a quiet, crisply drawn portrait of the world’s most celebrated ” and, “by Mr. Stone’s standards, a strikingly sober film”  —   with little in the way of wild conspiracy theories or bravura visuals. Human rights groups are taking advantage of the film’s splash to press President Obama to pardon Mr. Snowden, but lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee urged Mr. Obama not do so. _____ 7. China’s new class of   is bringing another novelty to the country: the stratospheric divorce settlement. In what appears to be the latest, the Chinese tycoon who holds a controlling stake in Grindr, the gay dating app, has been ordered to transfer some $1. 14 billion in shares of his own company, Beijing Kunlun World Wide Technology, to his wife. _____ 8. Our reporter on the hajj has had to cover her hair and robe herself, despite the heat. Even so, other women on the pilgrimage to Mecca have chastised her for not wearing socks. She relates her struggle with the limits that are Islam’s price of community, including a lesser place for women. “It can feel patronizing, and diminishing of our full humanity,” she writes. “It is why I started to lose faith after a childhood in an observant family and what I still struggle with, at 38, living a life that is secular but guided by Islamic values. ” _____ 9. An N. F. L. official said two Denver Broncos defenders were fined for hitting the Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton on the head in their season opener last week. Newton was hit on the head four times in the game, only one of which drew a penalty against the Broncos. But there were shining moments in the opening week of professional football, like the   34 completions the Kansas City Chiefs’ quarterback, Alex Smith, made against the San Diego Chargers. Tonight, the New York Jets play the Buffalo Bills. (8:25 p. m. Eastern, CBS) _____ 10.  Finally, good news: After years of planning and digitizing, much of the Museum of Modern Art’s sumptuous archives are now available on the museum’s website. “This is like a dream come true for me,” said the archives’ chief, Michelle Elligott, “because I’ve been playing around with this material for 20 years and I know the depth of what’s here. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

21710,"Hillary Clinton Returns to the Campaign Trail, Vowing New Approach - The New York Times",New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-09-23,2016.0,9.0,,"GREENSBORO, N. C.  —   A rested Hillary Clinton returned to the campaign trail here on Thursday after three days of recovering at home from pneumonia, and vowed a different approach on the final stretch of the campaign, one more focused on her own positive vision for the country, rather than eviscerating her rival. “I want to close my campaign focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families,” Mrs. Clinton said after her first rally of her renewed campaign. “I want to give Americans something to vote for, not just against. ” The shift in tone felt striking after Mrs. Clinton had spent months tearing down her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump. But with less than eight weeks until Election Day and tightening polls showing a majority of voters dislike and distrust her, aides said it was imperative that Mrs. Clinton deliver a more uplifting message. “From now until Nov. 8, everywhere I go I’m going to talk about my ideas for our country,” Mrs. Clinton said. Next week, Mrs. Clinton plans speeches to discuss how she would help young people and improve the economy, weaving in her own background as an advocate for children and as a first lady focused on women and families. That focus was central in her address here at the University of North Carolina, where she took the stage to James Brown’s “I Got You (I Feel Good),” seeming rested and revived, eager to tell the audience that her rare couple of days of downtime allowed her to “reconnect with what this whole campaign is about. ” “I’m running for all mothers and fathers trying to stay healthy so they can be there for their kids, but perhaps most of all, I’m running for those kids,” she said. “Standing up for children has been the work of my life, as a lawyer for the Children’s Defense Fund, as first lady of Arkansas, in the White House. ” With just 54 days until the election, “sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be,” she said. But she called the time off “a gift. ” Her return to the campaign trail comes as a series of polls suggest a closer race. Mrs. Clinton has faced a more disciplined Mr. Trump and scrutiny over her failure to initially disclose her pneumonia to all but a few close aides. A New York   News poll released on Thursday found her virtually tied with Mr. Trump among likely voters. Asked about the narrowing gap with Mr. Trump on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said, “I’ve always said this is going to be a tight race. ” On her campaign plane earlier Thursday, a   Mrs. Clinton said she felt fully recovered. “I am doing great,” she said before takeoff in White Plains, N. Y. as she made her way down the aisle. Mrs. Clinton flashed a wide smile at journalists studying her for signs of fatigue or illness and said she was looking forward to getting back into action. And at her rally later, she reflected on her time recuperating. “I talked with some old friends,” she said. “I spent time with our very sweet dogs. The campaign trail doesn’t really encourage reflection, and it’s important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. ” “People like me, we’re lucky,” she added. “When I’m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can’t. ” Mrs. Clinton offered a rare public glimpse at her   humor, poking fun at herself for her plans that span “38 different policy areas. ” She said, “Like a lot of women, I have a tendency to overprepare. ” Mrs. Clinton did not entirely avoid criticizing Mr. Trump, telling reporters after the event, “We don’t need someone who rushes out a   plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. ” It was a reference to the child care proposals that Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka unveiled this week. The Clinton campaign’s efforts to put forth a kinder, gentler candidate began last week with a speech that Mrs. Clinton delivered in Kansas City, Mo. on her Methodist faith. But the change in tactics hit an unexpected snag on Sunday when Mrs. Clinton abruptly left a ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Amid intense scrutiny over Mrs. Clinton’s lack of transparency over her initial diagnosis, her physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, later disclosed that Mrs. Clinton had been told she had pneumonia last Friday and that she had been overheated and dehydrated on Sunday. Rather than making her case to the American people, Mrs. Clinton found herself recovering at home as her campaign confronted a series of distractions and dueling doctors’ notes from her and Mr. Trump. And she had to apologize on Saturday after a backlash over remarks she made at a Friday night   in Manhattan in which she said that half of Mr. Trump’s supporters fell into a “basket of deplorables”  —   bigots, essentially, of one sort or the other. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton, when pressed about her handling of her diagnosis, appeared eager to put the rough patch behind her. “I didn’t want to stop,” she told reporters. “I didn’t want to quit campaigning. I certainly didn’t want to miss the   memorial. ” “It didn’t work out,” she continued. “So I got the antibiotics up and going, got the rest I needed and we’re going on from there. ”"
21723,"Hillary Clinton’s Backers Thought She Couldn’t Lose. Now, ‘I Can’t Go There.’ - The New York Times",New York Times,Matt Flegenheimer,M,2016-09-21,2016.0,9.0,,"Beside the olive display at Zabar’s, that iconic hub of lox and neurosis on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Linda Donohue was trying to talk herself down. Surely the polls she tracked anxiously were not to be trusted, she said. Surely Donald J. Trump, the man with the garish golden tower across town, would not be allowed to reach the White House. “We have to have more faith in the American public,” said Ms. Donohue, 61, a longtime New Yorker now living in Seattle. A man behind her could not suppress a loud snort. Then Cathi Anderson, who was shopping with Ms. Donohue, mentioned yet another distressing poll, this one from Ohio, which showed Mr. Trump ahead. Ms. Donohue nodded grimly. Just in case her faith in the American electorate was misplaced, Ms. Donohue said, she had retained her Irish citizenship. For both parties, every election can feel like the most vital of a lifetime, the one day standing between a   nation and its imminent demise. Among liberals, there is an especially rich tradition of “” as even some practitioners call it, at the faintest sign of shakiness from their candidate. But as Hillary Clinton lurches toward Election Day, her supporters at times seem overwhelmed by a tsunami of unease, exacerbated by Mrs. Clinton’s bout of pneumonia and a   acknowledgment of the illness. They are confronting a question they had assumed, just a few weeks ago, they would not need to consider in a race against the most unpopular presidential nominee in modern times: Could Mrs. Clinton actually blow this? “It’s like someone dropped ice water on the head of America,” Julie Gaines, the owner of Fishs Eddy, a home goods store in Manhattan, said of Mr. Trump’s increased odds. “Everyone sobered up. This could happen. ” The creeping dread has accelerated in recent days, reaching critical levels even by Democratic standards. Mrs. Clinton became sick. Several polls tightened to the margin of panic, with Mr. Trump overtaking her in surveys in Ohio and Florida. And even as Democrats hoped on Friday that Mr. Trump’s latest gambit  —   seeking to distance himself from his long history of “birtherism”  —   would backfire, there is a fear that no scandal can sink him. A cartoon in The New Yorker captured it best: A woman sits in her psychiatrist’s office, perspiring in distress. The doctor scribbles on a pad. “I’m giving you something for Hillary’s pneumonia,” the caption reads. Supporters of Mrs. Clinton have greeted the moment with varying degrees of alarm, according to interviews with dozens of them across the country. They read warily about the health of her lungs and her   field operations. They reassure one another by reminding themselves of President Obama’s two winning campaigns, which encountered similar fits of concern after Labor Day. But even some zealous Clinton defenders have grown frustrated with their candidate, marveling at the prospect of her snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, for which some say they would never forgive her. The campaign’s decision last week not to acknowledge Mrs. Clinton’s pneumonia until two days after a diagnosis, once video surfaced of her stumbling out of a Sept. 11 memorial service on Sunday, has especially rankled. “They kept it from us,” said Sonia Ascher, 74, a former campaign volunteer, sitting with her husband and son at a coffee shop in Portsmouth, N. H. “It was just another thing again, another mistake, which she really can’t afford right now. ” The gloom seems to be spreading. Maurice Doucet, 55, a software engineer from Portland, Ore. wondered aloud on Wednesday how the race had gotten this close, lamenting Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. “The rational side of my brain goes, ‘There’s no way people are actually going to switch sides,’” he said of voters’ movement toward Mr. Trump. “But the emotional side,” he added, his voice trailing off moments later. In Washington Square Park in Manhattan, among smitten college students and acoustic guitars, Guillermo Vidal, 75, grimaced at the thought of a Trump presidency. His friend’s bichon   mix, Dipsy, sat on the bench beside him, looking fretful. Mr. Vidal was asked what was troubling Dipsy. “She’s a Democrat,” Mr. Vidal said dryly. Then there are those who traffic in angst professionally, who are straining to consider even the chance of a Trump election. “The possibility of that is too horrifying to broach,” Larry David, the “Seinfeld”   and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star, wrote in an email. “It’s like contemplating your own death. ” Surely Mr. David had done that, too? “I can’t go there,” he said. In liberal enclaves, some modest contingency planning has begun. Threats of relocation are a bipartisan ritual every four years, expanding the audience for Canadian home listings. But this time, voters seem to be taking their research a bit more seriously. Ramona Gant, 28, a graduate student in Chicago, said she had just renewed her passport with the election in mind. Ms. Donohue’s friend at Zabar’s, Ms. Anderson, also of Seattle, mused that Vancouver was not too far up the road. Mike Brennan, 67, from Ventura County, Calif. is keeping an eye on the stock market. “If it looks like it’s going to be close,” said Mr. Brennan, a Republican supporting Mrs. Clinton, “I’ll pull my money out. ” For many Americans, Mr. Trump’s momentum has registered as a more visceral threat, heightening concerns that had festered since his candidacy began. Ahtziry Barrera, 18, a college freshman from Orlando, Fla. arrived in the United States more than a decade ago from Mexico. Under an Obama administration policy known as DACA, which Mrs. Clinton has vowed to protect, Ms. Barrera has been allowed to stay in the country because she entered as a child. “A lot of people were not taking him seriously. ‘Oh, he’s not going to win.’ But it happened,” she said of Mr. Trump’s success in the Republican primary race. “It is a big stress on me, knowing that Nov. 8 is the day I’ll know whether my future is going to be secure or not. ” Some optimists have preached calm, reminding one another of Mrs. Clinton’s organizational advantages and holding out hope that she can best Mr. Trump decisively on a debate stage. While allowing that Mrs. Clinton has not run a perfect race, many of her admirers have cast blame elsewhere, singling out the news media, the Republicans who nominated Mr. Trump and, of course, the man himself. Gloria Steinem, the feminist leader and a Clinton supporter, said in an email that she had sensed a growing worry in recent weeks, fearing that Mr. Trump’s candidacy was becoming “legitimized by ‘media evenhandedness’” that had made his assorted scandals seem more banal. “There are things any campaign could do better, but in this case, I fear it’s like blaming the victim instead of the bully  —   dissociating in the hope that we won’t be bullied, too,” she wrote. “It’s like saying, ‘If only she hadn’t been walking in that neighborhood.   …    ’” Others hold tight to an abiding belief, perhaps against their better judgment, that everything will work out. “I still believe in humanity,” said Nadia Johnson, 22, a Brooklyn resident lunching at a Whole Foods this week. She quickly added a request: Ask her again in November."
21734,Donald Trump Says Hillary Clinton’s Bodyguards Should Disarm to ‘See What Happens to Her’ - The New York Times,New York Times,"Nick Corasaniti, Nicholas Confessore and Michael Barbaro",M,2016-09-27,2016.0,9.0,,"MIAMI  —   Donald J. Trump once again raised the specter of violence against Hillary Clinton, suggesting Friday that the Secret Service agents who guard her voluntarily disarm to “see what happens to her” without their protection. “I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Miami, to loud applause. “I think they should disarm. Immediately. ” He went on: “Let’s see what happens to her. Take their guns away, O. K. It’ll be very dangerous. ” In justifying his remarks, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that Mrs. Clinton wants to “destroy your Second Amendment,” apparently a reference to her gun control policies. Presidential nominees are protected at all times by heavily armed teams of Secret Service agents, some uniformed and some undercover, who are devoted to the candidates’ physical safety. Mr. Trump’s comments were a provocative echo of widely condemned remarks he made in early August at a campaign rally in Wilmington, N. C. There, he airily suggested that gun rights supporters should rise up against Mrs. Clinton if she were elected to stop her from appointing judges who might favor stricter gun regulation. “If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added, “Although the Second Amendment people  —   maybe there is, I don’t know. ” Those remarks were widely interpreted as an invitation for   supporters to take matters into their own hands should Mrs. Clinton prevail in November’s election. Mr. Trump never apologized or disavowed the comments, despite angry denunciations from Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and groups like the Brady Campaign and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. On Friday night, Robby Mook, her campaign manager, said after Mr. Trump’s rally in Miami that he had shown “a pattern of inciting people to violence. ” “Whether this is done to provoke protesters at a rally or casually or even as a joke, it is an unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of commander in chief,” Mr. Mook said in a statement. “This kind of talk should be out of bounds for a presidential candidate. ” Matt Bennett, a vice president at Third Way, a think tank that advocates gun control, expressed disbelief at Mr. Trump’s “cavalier disregard for the safety” of Mrs. Clinton. “No serious gun rights person believes that a Secret Service protectee should have their protection taken away,” Mr. Bennett said. It was the culmination of a rocky and unpredictable day for Mr. Trump, and diverted attention, for a moment at least, from his grudging admission of error when he finally conceded that President Obama was born in the United States. On Friday night, breaking from his prepared remarks and turning his gaze from the teleprompters, Mr. Trump looked straight into the crowd as he made the insinuation about Mrs. Clinton’s safety. He gestured emphatically with his hands as he spoke, at one time pointing to a member in the crowd to find agreement. “What do you think?” he asked about his remarks on Mrs. Clinton’s bodyguards, as the arena erupted into cheers. In May, Mr. Trump accused Mrs. Clinton in a Twitter post of hypocrisy for accepting armed Secret Service protection while supporting some limits on access to weapons for civilians. That post also levied a false accusation against Mrs. Clinton, suggesting she supported a ban on all guns. She does not. “Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed,” Mr. Trump wrote. “No more guns to protect Hillary!” he added, although he did not go so far as to say what could happen if such protection were to be removed. Violence and allusions to it have punctuated Mr. Trump’s campaign: Punches have been thrown at his rallies, protesters have been roughed up by Trump supporters, and the candidate himself has repeatedly deployed a lexicon of physical aggression. “I’d like to punch him in the face,” Mr. Trump said in February when a protester was dragged out of his rally in Las Vegas. In the past, Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from his own menacing remarks by later dismissing them as playful or misinterpreted. His Republican supporters, meanwhile, have been pressed after every remark to distance themselves from him. On Friday night, officials of the Republican National Committee, which is working to help his campaign, did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump’s comments were a variation on criticisms made by the National Rifle Association, perhaps Mr. Trump’s closest political ally in the presidential race. The group has publicly criticized Secret Service protection for Mr. Obama’s two daughters, which is required under federal law, as hypocritical. In 2013, the group released an advertisement calling Mr. Obama “an elitist hypocrite” for allowing the service to protect his family  —   which, like other first families, has faced multiple death threats  —   but opposing the widespread use of armed guards in schools."
21811,Liberals See Hillary Clinton’s Focus on Big Donors as Bafflingly Dated - The New York Times,New York Times,Jonathan Martin,M,2016-09-22,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   In 2012, B. Rowe Winecoff, a retired social worker from Newton, Iowa, contributed $120 to President Obama’s   campaign. But he has yet to give any money to Hillary Clinton in this election. “This year just seems dirtier than ever,” said Mr. Winecoff, a Democrat, explaining why he has not contributed to the candidate he intends to vote for. Even as newly released financial disclosures reveal that Mrs. Clinton enjoys a substantial   advantage over Donald J. Trump, she is struggling to replicate the sort of   juggernaut that Mr. Obama enjoyed in his campaigns and Senator Bernie Sanders relied on in this year’s Democratic primaries. In an illustration of the lack of enthusiasm for her among some liberal activists, just 24 percent of the contributors to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign so far have given $200 or less. In 2012, 43 percent of the money to Mr. Obama was from contributors who gave $200 or less, and this year 58 percent of the giving to Mr. Sanders’s   bid came from   donors. Without this online network, Mrs. Clinton is being made to continue with an aggressive calendar of   with rich donors as Election Day grows near  —   events that can limit her time in swing states and reinforce concerns that give    Democrats pause. “Hillary has been at so many   and off the campaign trail,” said Mr. Winecoff, bringing up her schedule without prompting. “And a lot of money is coming from special interests, so we’re concerned about what that’s going to mean. ” Since Labor Day, the traditional start of general election campaigns, Mrs. Clinton has appeared at nine   while attending five public events in swing states. And that does not include the multiple money events she was set to attend in California, but instead sent Bill Clinton to after she came down with pneumonia. Mrs. Clinton has tried to meld her need to raise money for advertisements and   efforts with her retail campaign. But it can be a stretch. After addressing college students at Temple University this week, for example, she attended a   hosted by David L. Cohen, a Comcast executive and Philadelphia Democratic powerhouse, that brought in roughly $3 million. Trying to keep with the day’s theme, college students and young Comcast employees were also invited, to interact with Mrs. Clinton in the kind of rarefied small setting typically reserved for wealthy contributors. “What Bernie did in the primary was truly incredible, but we’re very happy with the state of our   ” said Josh Scherwin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, adding that “September is shaping up to be our best month for online  . ” But the campaign’s traditional approach to raising money is maddening to many Democrats, particularly liberals who have witnessed the evolution of online   and are baffled at why Mrs. Clinton is so committed to an approach they see as nearly as dated as torchlight parades. “It boggles my mind that the Clinton campaign didn’t learn their lessons from 2012 or even earlier this year, and haven’t moved toward a more open and public campaign, one that constantly has her in front of real people instead of rich people,” said Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the blog Daily Kos. He continued: “Sanders certainly proved that if you focus all of your energy on the voting public, that core supporters will reward that love with real money. Instead, Clinton’s campaign still seems stuck on the old model of      . As a result, she looks secluded and out of reach, further reinforcing the notion that she cares more about the wealthy than regular folks. ” This close to the election, though, Mrs. Clinton may not have much of a choice. Given Democratic fears of Mr. Trump and her advantage in the race, there is an intense demand for her in the ranks of major Democratic givers. “Just trying to find a date has been a challenge,” said James Hodges, a former South Carolina governor who has been trying to organize an event for Mrs. Clinton before the election. Further, the very   model she is depending on demands a continued stream of events with contribution levels that begin at five figures and often run higher. It is an approach that she and Mr. Clinton are well acquainted with, dating to the 1990s when raising soft money for the national parties was legal. They have enduring relationships with donors in all 50 states going back to those days. So unlike in the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. Sanders, who began as insurgents, necessity has not demanded that Mrs. Clinton raise money any other way. (Mr. Obama ultimately fashioned a network that relied on both modest givers and the wealthy.) “She’s invested heavily in the infrastructure of human beings: finance directors across the country, photo lines and   membership,” said Scott Goodstein, the founder of Revolution Messaging, an online Democratic   firm. “Now they’ve got to play that out. She, unfortunately, made that commitment to do those five house parties or what have you in New York and now she has to stand on that because her bundler network needs it. ” Mr. Goodstein, whose firm ran Mr. Sanders’s online   effort, added that “the mistake that I think they made was not reaching deeper, building deeper infrastructure and a deeper coalition. ” Instead, she is relying on the sort of     that is a staple of Washington. And she is not the only one making herself available to major contributors who want to influence policy. This month, for example, Michele Flournoy, who is seen as a favorite to be Mrs. Clinton’s defense secretary, headlined a   in    Northern Virginia where the top contribution requested was $5, 000. Mrs. Clinton’s     has picked up in recent months, and over half of the total money she raised last month came through online contributions, according to a campaign aide. And with polls tightening, Democrats expect Mrs. Clinton’s online success to pick up. “Urgency really drives action,” said Mitch Stewart, a veteran of Mr. Obama’s campaigns. It is Mr. Trump who is drawing more from modest givers as a percentage of his total contributions.   percent of his donations through the end of July were in amounts of $200 or less, a figure that is partly explained by the resistance to his candidacy from wealthy Republican contributors. Yet many in Mrs. Clinton’s own party believe she could have done far better had she made Democratic activists feel as invested as the party’s elites. “The campaigns with the most effective networks of   donors are the campaigns where   donors feel their donations matter,” said Ari   a SiriusXM radio host who has worked on online   campaigns for Democrats."
21863,Theories of the Race: How Solid Is Hillary Clinton’s Lead? - The New York Times,New York Times,Nate Cohn,M,2016-09-27,2016.0,9.0,,"Hillary Clinton held a modest and potentially vulnerable lead over Donald J. Trump ahead of the first presidential debate Monday night, with a large number of voters remaining undecided or saying they’ll support a   candidate. It’s not where it seemed the race would stand a month ago, when Mrs. Clinton led national polls by around eight percentage points. Her large advantage has dwindled. Now she is ahead by around two percentage points in   national surveys of likely voters, and in the key states she needs to win the Electoral College. The good news for Mrs. Clinton is that she still holds an advantage. She has trailed in just two   national surveys since the conventions. The state polling has been similar. Since the Democratic convention in late July, Mrs. Clinton has led in all but one   poll in a combination of states worth a total of 272 electoral votes, two over the 270 needed to win. Her favorable states include those that went for the Democrats John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000, minus Maine’s Second Congressional District, plus New Mexico, New Hampshire, Virginia and Colorado. In a sense, this is reminiscent of 2012. President Obama had what was called a Midwestern firewall: a lead in the   states, plus Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio  —   worth a total of 271 electoral votes. Like Mrs. Clinton’s edge, Mr. Obama’s lead in these states was occasionally quite narrow. But there was never a point where Mitt Romney was tied or ahead there, and the same is true for Mr. Trump. But there’s one big difference: the number of voters who say they’re undecided or support a   candidate. Strictly by the numbers, a   lead is not especially robust when 15 or even 20 percent of voters either are undecided or say they support a   candidate. The sizable number of undecided voters is partly responsible for the volatility in the polling this year. Mrs. Clinton’s lead has bobbed between two and eight percentage points since April (though Mr. Trump held a fleeting lead in the few days immediately after the Republican convention). With so many voters on the sidelines, fairly modest shifts in the tone of the race or news media coverage can bring undecided voters onto or off the sidelines, moving the polls even as few voters actually change their minds. The   candidates also make things harder for analysts. In general, strong   candidates with solid name recognition and a real base of committed support  —   think Ross Perot or John Anderson  —   hold that core support in the polls on Election Day. But weaker   candidates  —   those without much name recognition  —   have a much worse track record. Their supporters tend not to vote or to switch to a   candidate. One wonders whether those people were ever actually supporters at all, or whether they were just uncertain or disaffected voters taking an option provided to them by pollsters. For this same reason, it’s a little hard to make sense of the shifts in the race. One theory holds that the race is relatively stable, with the polls shifting only as each side’s marginal voters feel moved to voice support for a candidate they don’t really like. When the news is bad for Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump, the voters at the periphery of their coalitions say they’re undecided, unlikely to vote or supporting a   candidate. When the news gets better, these voters feel more comfortable saying they’ll support either candidate. This dynamic fits with the tendency of the polls to bounce up and down, almost like a stock market trading range. If this theory is right, Mrs. Clinton is likelier to retake a more comfortable lead than to fall behind Mr. Trump. One could even spin Mrs. Clinton’s narrow lead as good news: She’s still ahead despite some episodes that might have hurt her  —   like the “basket of deplorables” comment and her pneumonia (and secrecy about it). The other theory holds that Mrs. Clinton really has lost ground, and that there’s no reason to suppose that she’s likelier to rebound than to keep falling. Why would she have lost ground? Part of the explanation might be that her   bounce hadn’t actually faded by Labor Day. Another possible reason is that Mr. Trump has been fairly well behaved over the last month. He hasn’t gotten himself into too much trouble, relatively speaking, since his feud with the family of Capt. Humayun Khan, allowing other stories  —   including ones about Mrs. Clinton  —   to supplant the steady stream of news coverage about Mr. Trump’s remarks. If this theory is right, Mrs. Clinton would still be the favorite  —   she leads today, after all  —   but she would be in danger. One could argue that she led by a large margin only because Mr. Trump failed to clear even the lowest bars of competence and decorum for a presidential nominee. It would also suggest that the debates are a big opportunity for Mr. Trump: By simply being perceived as acting presidential, he could cement his current gains and even make additional improvement. Which theory is right? Historically, it’s not obvious that either interpretation is the better one. Sometimes, races really do change for good. Other times, shifts in the polls are just noise. One thing that helps Mrs. Clinton is that the current pool of undecided and   voters is quite diverse. It includes disaffected young idealists,   Democrats,     and probably some of the voters who don’t pay much attention to the news and who just can’t make up their mind between two unpopular candidates. In general, a more diverse pool of undecided voters helps the candidate in the lead, since it makes them less likely to break one way. There is mainly upside for Mrs. Clinton among the disaffected young idealists, who are unlikely to break for Mr. Trump but who could be lured back to her from a   candidate or from the ranks of the undecided. Mrs. Clinton’s weakness among young voters is undermining what many assumed would be her biggest strength against Mr. Trump: Hispanic and black voters. Nonwhite voters are disproportionately young, and her weakness among young voters is a major reason Mrs. Clinton is not quite matching Mr. Obama’s margin among nonwhite voters in national surveys despite Mr. Trump’s appeal to racial and ethnic resentment. There’s probably more room for Mrs. Clinton to improve than the other way around. Then there are the undecided, conflicted     and    . According to recent national surveys, Mrs. Clinton is faring far worse among white voters without a degree than Mr. Obama was four years ago. It has put her behind in Ohio, the anchor of Mr. Obama’s Midwestern firewall, as well as in Iowa and Maine’s Second Congressional District. Who are they? They’re the voters who were the focus of   coverage in 2012. They didn’t love Mr. Obama, but they tended to vote for him because they thought he looked out for the middle class. They believed that Mr. Romney was a plutocrat who outsourced jobs and would favor the rich over ordinary Americans. For the Northern white   voters who helped give Mr. Obama his   win, the 2016 election is sort of a strange reversal of 2012. This time, it’s the Republican businessman who has positioned himself as the candidate fighting for ordinary Americans. He has adopted positions with real appeal to     whether on trade, immigration or the social safety net. Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, is the one being caricatured as Mr. Romney was: as corrupt and bought by special interest and corporations. So far, Mr. Trump’s losses among   suburban Republican voters have roughly canceled out Mrs. Clinton’s losses among less educated Democrats. But Mrs. Clinton hasn’t locked down their support, just as Mr. Trump hasn’t locked down white   Democrats. In some ways, it’s not easy for either candidate to sweep both groups. After all, the sort of message that appeals to   Republican voters may not resonate with   Democrats, and vice versa. But there is one thing that might affect both groups: their view of whether Mr. Trump can handle the presidency. Much depends on how they conclude he performed on Monday night."
21879,I Muted Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton During the Debate. I Still Knew the Score. - The New York Times,New York Times,Jonathan Mahler,M,2016-10-03,2016.0,10.0,,"It was a little shimmy of her shoulders  —   cheeky, insouciant  —   accompanied by a big, toothy grin. Her opponent smirked. She looked as if she was having fun. He, not so much. The exchange came as the first presidential debate was building toward its conclusion Monday night. What was it about? I have no idea. Per instructions from my editor, I was watching with the sound off. Alone. No checking my email, no talking to my wife, no social media. It was, for me, a silent debate. The idea was simple: to test the theory that what presidential candidates  —   in this instance, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump  —   say during debates is less important than what they look like while they’re saying it. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this theory, dating from the nation’s first televised presidential debate: Richard M. Nixon versus John F. Kennedy in 1960, which set the handsome and composed Kennedy on a course to victory over the conspicuously underweight and sweaty Nixon. Ever since, presidential debates have routinely been defined more powerfully by images than by words. You can even find academic research on the subject: nonverbal expression, the experts call it. A psychology professor has had some success predicting the outcome of elections based purely on which candidate blinks less frequently during debates, the idea being that   blinking is a sign of stress and anxiety, generally not desirable qualities in a commander in chief. (For what it’s worth, it’s also possible to blink too little, which can make a candidate seem reptilian.) Hence our experiment: Can you learn more about who won the debate by watching it on mute? It began, of course, with the ritual handshake at center stage before the candidates retreated to their lecterns. After the shake, Mr. Trump placed his hand gently on Mrs. Clinton’s back. There were different ways to interpret the gesture. Was he being patronizing  —   trying to assert his   dominance from the    —   or just looking to demonstrate that he felt comfortable, relaxed, unthreatened by the professional politician? Whether involuntary or intentional, the signal was unmistakable: I’m the strong one here. And either way, they were soon off, discussing   …     the most pressing issues facing our nation, I can only assume. It will be no surprise to learn that Mr. Trump is loud even with the sound off. He delivered 90 minutes of increasingly exaggerated pantomime, announcing the presence of someone who is restless, impassioned, emphatic and at times belligerent. (“No idea what he’s talking about, but he’s def going at it hard,” read my notes from the   mark.) Do not call this man  . He has an extensive repertoire of almost manic hand and arm gestures: the   karate chop, the accordion, his patented cobra. The performance is so physical  —   with the pincer fingers, the hyperactive eyebrows, the “C’mon already!” shrugs  —   that there’s not much work left for the words to do. There is no ambiguity about the message: Actions speak louder than words. Also: Bring it on. Even when it was Mrs. Clinton’s turn to speak, Mr. Trump couldn’t stand still. He fidgeted. He smirked. He grimaced. He squinted. He adjusted his microphone. He grabbed hold of the sides of his lectern. He rocked back and forth on his heels. He pursed his lips. He threw his opponent a disbelieving sidelong glance, and then an eye roll. He shook his head. He appeared to interrupt her, repeatedly. (On one occasion, I could make out a word  —   a word!  —   “wrong. ”) He took a sip of water. And then another, licking his lips as he set the glass back down. He’s more expressive while listening than most people are while speaking. In the face of this continual turbulence, Mrs. Clinton had a studied serenity. She has made no secret of her assiduous debate preparation, and I couldn’t help feeling that she had prepared for the very exercise I was engaged in. She seemed determined to make sure that her body language and facial expressions didn’t communicate frustration or irritation  —   see Al Gore in 2000  —   no matter what her opponent said. And she seemed equally determined to appear to be having fun. Whether she was or not  —   could this possibly be fun?  —   she succeeded in looking the part. She appeared unbothered, even amused, by Mr. Trump’s apparent assaults. At times, she looked a little smug  —   surely a lot smug to Mr. Trump’s supporters. There was plenty of smiling  —   another product of the debate prep, no doubt  —   and laughing, too, presumably at Mr. Trump’s expense. The suggestion seemed to be that we were all in on the joke. She had her hand gestures, as well, including her version of the trademark “Clinton thumb,” but she did little in the way of violence to the air around her. Visually, anyway, there was a discernible arc to the event, with Mr. Trump growing more agitated as the night wore on, and Mrs. Clinton becoming almost giddy with what felt increasingly like genuine pleasure. Which brings us back to the shimmy. Absent words, it felt like the most telling moment of the evening, a memorable, instinctive reaction to what I imagined must have been a Trump howler. In that instant, it was clear that the debate had produced a winner, at least to those of us who hadn’t actually heard a word of what the candidates had said: Mrs. Clinton. He had vibrated with anxiety she had radiated cool confidence. He had seemed to be crawling out of his own skin she had looked uncharacteristically comfortable in hers. Minutes later, it was all over. Once again, the candidates came together. Once again, Mr. Trump put his hand on Mrs. Clinton’s back, this time with a little pat, as if to confer his approval on a job well done. Mr. Trump’s family came out to greet him, but they opted not to linger, exiting   while Mrs. Clinton and her husband celebrated the moment with their fans in the audience."
21942,"Hillary Clinton, Seizing on Tax Returns, Says Donald Trump Embodies ‘Rigged System’ - The New York Times",New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-10-04,2016.0,10.0,,"TOLEDO, Ohio  —   Hillary Clinton seized on revelations that Donald J. Trump could have avoided paying income taxes for up to 18 years to unleash a new torrent of criticism of her opponent, saying he pretended to help working Americans even as he personified “the same rigged system he claims he will change. ” “He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country’s,” Mrs. Clinton told a crowd of more than 1, 100 gathered for a rally on Monday at the Downtown Toledo Train Station. “It’s always Trump first, and everyone else last. ” Mrs. Clinton unleashed the attack during a previously planned economic speech in Ohio, where she has struggled to connect with white   voters, who have seen huge job losses amid the   flow of manufacturing plants overseas. But the revelation on Saturday night that Mr. Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns and could have avoided paying federal taxes for years added a new impetus and an extra dose of fire and brimstone to Mrs. Clinton’s economic pitch. She wasted little time in tying Mr. Trump’s tax practices to her broader economic message of reining in corporate excess and alleviating income inequality. “Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another and, yes, pay their taxes,” Mrs. Clinton said at the start of her remarks here. And noting the defense Mr. Trump’s allies have put forth  —   that his handling of his taxes reflects his “genius”  —   Mrs. Clinton said, “What kind of a genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?” She criticized Mr. Trump’s reluctance to release his tax returns  —   as every other major recent presidential candidate has done  —   and mentioned the article in The New York Times revealing his tax records. “While millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard and paying their fair share,” Mrs. Clinton said, “it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. ” Several hours later, at a campaign rally in Pueblo, Colo. Mr. Trump said that he had used the tax code “brilliantly,” and that his mastery of it meant he was best qualified to overhaul a deeply flawed system. “I understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can truly fix them,” he said. Mrs. Clinton wove her attack on Mr. Trump into an address in which she also criticized other corporate actors, including top executives at Wells Fargo after employees opened roughly 1. 5 million bank accounts and applied for 565, 000 credit cards that may not have been authorized by customers, according to regulators. The bank paid $185 million in fines, including a $100 million penalty from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the largest penalty the agency has ever issued. Mrs. Clinton seemed upbeat at the rally, her first since the revelations Saturday about Mr. Trump’s taxes. She boasted of being endorsed by LeBron James, who led the Cleveland Cavaliers to the N. B. A. championship and grew up in Akron, Ohio, which Mrs. Clinton was also visiting Monday. “I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio, LeBron will always be the king,” she said. Mrs. Clinton’s speech fit into a broader economic philosophy, endorsed by her closest economic advisers and often referred to as inclusive capitalism, that calls for corporations to put less emphasis on   profits and invest more in employees, the environment and communities. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton reiterated her proposal to raise the minimum wage, strengthen labor unions and offer tax incentives to companies that share profits with employees. She also unveiled two new policies to protect workers, including curbing the use of “forced arbitration” clauses in contracts that prohibit workers and consumers from bringing legal action against companies that have harmed them. “We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these   ‘gotchas’ to escape accountability,” Mrs. Clinton said. And she took aim at pharmaceutical companies, against the backdrop of outrage against Mylan, which repeatedly raised the price of EpiPens, leading to widespread consumer anger, particularly among parents whose children rely on the lifesaving injections after allergic reactions. “We should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need these drugs,” Mrs. Clinton said. The campaign stops in Toledo and Akron marked the first time Mrs. Clinton had visited Ohio since Labor Day, as polls show the state’s white   voters gravitating toward Mr. Trump. Fifty percent of likely voters in Ohio preferred Mr. Trump, compared with 46 percent for Mrs. Clinton, in a   poll last month. Early voting begins next week in Ohio, and the Clinton campaign has roughly 300 staff members and an army of volunteers working to register voters. On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton plans to embark on a   bus tour through the state largely focused on   economic issues. Recent polls have shown that Mrs. Clinton has gained an advantage on Mr. Trump when voters are asked who will best handle the economy. Ever since the Democratic nominating fight, Mrs. Clinton has called out specific corporate players for criticism, trying to demonstrate to voters how she would approach corporate misbehavior as president. The same day Mrs. Clinton fought to present herself as a champion of   Rust Belt voters, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the Clinton family’s finances. In the years since Mr. Clinton left the White House, the Clintons have amassed in excess of $125 million delivering paid speeches to Wall Street and other special interests. “Hillary Clinton hasn’t made an honest dollar in her entire life,” he said in Pueblo, contrasting his   experience to her profiting off her career of public service by making speeches. “Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke,” he said. “Now she and her husband have made more than $200 million without building a company or creating a single thing of value. ” Although the data has shown steady job growth under President Obama, voters in states like Ohio have not felt that the economy has come back, said Nina Turner, a former state senator from Ohio who supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary race. “They feel like, ‘My quality of life hasn’t gotten much better, and I need somebody to speak to those issues,’” Ms. Turner said. “Instead,” she said of the two   nominees, “we have two wealthy people battling back and forth. ”"
22072,Group’s Tactic on Hillary Clinton: Sue Her Again and Again - The New York Times,New York Times,Jonathan Mahler,M,2016-10-17,2016.0,10.0,,"In between her extensive debate prep and her final, frenzied bid to raise money and win over voters, Hillary Clinton has had to carve out time to answer 25 detailed questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The questions came not from the F. B. I. which has closed its investigation into the issue, or from Congress, or even from a news outlet. They came from a nonprofit organization called Judicial Watch. If the 2016 election has brought forward a new generation of Clinton antagonists  —   WikiLeaks, Breitbart, Russia  —   it has also reintroduced America to an old one. Judicial Watch was one of the Clintons’ original tormentors, a charter member of what Mrs. Clinton famously called a “vast   conspiracy” to destroy her and her husband by seizing on any potential scandal. The organization filed its first lawsuit against the Clintons shortly after its formation in 1994, and it pretty much never stopped. It is currently the plaintiff in more than 20 suits involving Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. “People always used to say to me, ‘What are you going to do when the Clintons leave? ’” Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, said in an interview. “Well, the Clintons never really left. ” Neither has Judicial Watch, the indefatigable Clinton adversary that has probably done more than any other individual or organization to create the narrative that Mrs. Clinton is still battling: that she is untrustworthy. It is a narrative that her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, has tried to exploit at every turn, whether he was labeling her “Crooked Hillary,” saying there was something “very fishy” about the suicide of her former law partner, Vincent W. Foster Jr. or suggesting that she might be concealing serious health problems. Judicial Watch’s strategy is simple:   the federal courts with Freedom of Information Act lawsuits. A vast majority are dismissed. But Judicial Watch caught a break last year, when revelations about Mrs. Clinton’s private email server prompted two judges to reopen two of the group’s cases connected to her tenure as secretary of state. The lawsuits have since led to the release of hundreds of Mrs. Clinton’s emails  —   which have, in turn, spurred dozens of news releases and   letters from Judicial Watch that hype the significance of these documents, while putting them in the least flattering light possible for Mrs. Clinton. The group’s lawyers were given permission to depose several of her senior aides from her time at the State Department. What is more, Mrs. Clinton herself will have to answer 25 detailed questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The questions, some with multiple parts, ask her to explain her rationale for using the private server and her reaction to warnings about the potential for security breaches, among other things. Her answers, to be provided via written testimony to the court, are due by Thursday. Just getting this far has represented a victory for Judicial Watch, which operates out of a nondescript office building in the shadow of the Capitol. Suing the government, repeatedly, is an expensive proposition Judicial Watch has an annual budget of about $35 million that pays for close to 50 employees  —   a mix of lawyers, investigators and  . Mr. Fitton says the group receives donations from nearly 400, 000 individuals and institutions every year. One of its biggest funders, according to public filings, is the Sarah Scaife Foundation, which was created by the banking heir Richard Mellon Scaife, who died in 2014. In the 1990s, Mr. Scaife was one of the leading financiers of the   effort to bring down the Clintons, bankrolling conservative think tanks and publications  —   as well as Judicial Watch. Litigiousness is in the organization’s DNA: Its founder, Larry Klayman, once sued his mother. Mr. Klayman has described himself as a conservative Ralph Nader, but during Bill Clinton’s presidency, he often behaved more like a   Kenneth W. Starr, papering Washington with subpoenas related to every   Clinton scandal. His departure from the organization in 2003 was accompanied, unsurprisingly, by litigation: Mr. Klayman accused the organization, and his successor, Mr. Fitton, of “fraud, disparagement, defamation, false advertising and other egregious acts. ” Mr. Fitton responded that the allegations were “full of lies and distortions. ” The suit is still in the courts. Since he took over in 2003, Mr. Fitton has sought mainstream respectability for the organization. It describes itself as a “nonpartisan educational foundation,” but Mr. Fitton says it is also a media organization. “We’re filling multiple roles here in a Washington where the traditional vehicles for government accountability have broken down,” he said. Last year, he nominated Judicial Watch for three Pulitzer Prizes. He was told that because Judicial Watch was an advocacy group, it did not meet the Pulitzer committee’s eligibility criteria, a ruling he attributed to liberal bias. If Mr. Fitton is seen as less flamboyant than his predecessor, he has been no less dogged in his pursuit of Mrs. Clinton. In 2009, Judicial Watch sued to prevent her from becoming secretary of state, claiming that an obscure clause in the Constitution prevented former members of Congress who voted to increase the salary of a government position from being appointed to that position. For that matter, Judicial Watch is still suing the government to obtain a draft of the indictment against Mrs. Clinton that federal prosecutors prepared in 1998, when they were considering bringing charges against her in the Whitewater investigation. “I think to say that they are not partisan would not be accurate,” said Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. “Look at the way that they have dealt with the Clintons. It seems as if they’ve been out to do them harm. ” According to Mr. Fitton, however, Judicial Watch’s persistence has been rewarded. “The documents we have uncovered in the last year or so are gobsmacking in terms of what they say about what Mrs. Clinton was up to, the depths of her criminality,” he said. There is little doubt that the group has forced the release of government records that would otherwise have been kept from the public. More contentious is the claim that these documents illuminate Mrs. Clinton’s behavior, at least in the absence of the organization’s spin, which has broadly asserted that the Democratic presidential nominee used her position at the State Department to further the interests of her family’s foundation. A Judicial Watch news release from August highlighted a newly disclosed 2009 email from a Clinton Foundation official to two of Mrs. Clinton’s senior aides at the State Department, requesting a meeting between a foundation donor and the United States ambassador to Lebanon. “Clinton’s top aides’ favors for and interactions with the Clinton Foundation seem in violation of the ethics agreements that Hillary Clinton agreed to in order to be appointed and confirmed as Secretary of State,” the organization wrote. But the ambassador, Jeffrey D. Feltman, subsequently denied that the meeting had taken place. Judicial Watch is a polarizing group, even among advocates for greater government transparency. Critics accuse it of weaponizing the Freedom of Information Act for political purposes. They argue that its unending barrage of lawsuits does more harm than good by draining federal resources, tying up the courts and wasting public servants’ time. The Freedom of Information Act “is a legitimate tool for government transparency, but it’s possible to abuse it,” said Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. “There is a question about whether they are enriching or distorting political discourse. ” The group’s defenders argue that its success in bringing to light thousands of buried emails speaks for itself, and that people can ignore the organization’s spin and make their own decisions about what the records mean. “They are obviously not just going on fishing expeditions, because they are producing documents that are resulting in stories and public debates,” said Danielle Brian, the director of the Project on Government Oversight. Mr. Fitton, the Judicial Watch president, said his group fought just as hard for transparency during George W. Bush’s presidency. Notably, it teamed with the Sierra Club in an unsuccessful effort to obtain the records of Vice President Dick Cheney’s energy policy task force. Judicial Watch’s claims of nonpartisanship will be tested if Republicans win the White House next month. For now, anyway, Mr. Trump seems safe from the group’s scrutiny. Mr. Fitton, when asked if he was concerned about the Republican nominee’s unwillingness to release his tax returns, said he was far more troubled by the Internal Revenue Service’s decision to audit Mr. Trump. “I think the I. R. S. is a Sword of Damocles over the First Amendment, and I think it is a menace,” he said. And the pending federal action against Trump University for defrauding students? Mr. Fitton, whose organization has filed about 300 lawsuits against the Obama administration, described it as “ambulance chasing. ” As for Mrs. Clinton, she can expect to remain in the group’s sights whether she wins or loses. “Everyone wants to move on,” Mr. Fitton said. “We don’t move on. ”"
22123,"Hillary Clinton Liked Covert Action if It Stayed Covert, Transcript Shows - The New York Times",New York Times,David E. Sanger,M,2016-10-17,2016.0,10.0,,"Hillary Clinton longs for the days when Americans knew how to execute a covert action abroad and not spill the details to reporters. Addressing a Goldman Sachs event in 2013, in one of the speeches that WikiLeaks published on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton gave a   realpolitik answer to the question of how to handle a problem like Syria. If the best chance of success was to act secretly inside that country, she made clear, she had no problem doing that. She went on to say  —   as her audience already knew because of revelations in the news media  —   that as secretary of state she had advocated secretly arming the Syrian opposition and moving forcefully to counter the Russians, who at that point were supporting President Bashar   but had not yet fully entered the conflict. “My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,” she said in answer to a question from Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, which paid Mrs. Clinton about $225, 000 a speech to give what felt like an insider’s view of the making of American foreign policy, months after she left office. But she quickly acknowledged that “we used to be much better at this than we are now. ” “Now, you know, everybody can’t help themselves,” she added, and officials go out to “tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: ‘Look what we’re doing, and I want credit for it. ’” The three hacked speeches from 2013 that WikiLeaks published, most likely with Russian government assistance, help explain how Mrs. Clinton approaches some of the world’s knottiest problems. They are a reminder of the   way she often assesses her most vexing opponents when the television cameras are not on. By the time she left office that year, she had met and assessed two of the three world leaders who were determined most prominently to challenge the United States: President Xi Jinping of China, whom she clearly admires President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom she clearly detests (and who has returned the sentiment this election) and Kim   of North Korea, whose determination to build a nuclear weapon and missiles that could “reach Hawaii and the West Coast, theoretically” poses a risk “we cannot abide,” she said. At moments in the speeches, Mrs. Clinton was cleareyed about how difficult it would be to execute some of the actions she advocated, including a   zone over parts of Syria. “To have a   zone, you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas,” she said. “So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk  —   you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians. So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians. ” Her assessment of the risk came before she was formally running for president. But two years later, in a television interview in October 2015, she sounded willing to take that risk. “I personally would be advocating now for a   zone and humanitarian corridors to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air, to try to provide some way to take stock of what’s happening, to try to stem the flow of refugees,” she said. Her successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, tried last month to open those humanitarian corridors, but the effort collapsed in a dispute with Russia. A push to get it restarted during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday between Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, also failed. In the talks at Goldman Sachs, Mrs. Clinton was often more analytic than prescriptive, describing her perceptions of individual leaders and the domestic politics and foreign threats they face. In that regard, her approach is quite different from that of Donald J. Trump. In two interviews on foreign policy with The New York Times, one in March and another in July, Mr. Trump moved directly to his plans of action: bombing the Islamic State and taking oil, for example, or withdrawing troops from Europe and Asia if allies do not pay their share. While Mr. Trump often talks in terms of striking deals, Mrs. Clinton talks in the more traditional terms of  . When she became secretary in 2009, she posed a question about China to an Australian leader: “How do you deal toughly with your banker?” In the Goldman transcript, she suggested that she had answered her own question when sparring with the Chinese over its claims in the South China Sea. “I made the point at one point in the argument that, you know, you can call it whatever you want to call it,” she said. “You don’t have a claim to all of it. I said, by that argument, you know, the United States should claim all of the Pacific. We liberated it, we defended it. We have as much claim to all of the Pacific. And we could call it the American Sea, and it could go from the West Coast of California all the way to the Philippines. ” “And, you know, my counterpart sat up very straight and goes, ‘Well, you can’t do that. ’” Mrs. Clinton segued into an evaluation of Mr. Xi, the Chinese leader, who she noted had consolidated power in a way his predecessor never did, but had quickly traveled to places like Russia and Africa to assuage “doubts about Chinese practices. ” “So he’s someone who you at least have the impression is a more worldly, somewhat more experienced politician,” she said. Mr. Xi has since become more aggressive in the South China Sea, and it is unclear how forcefully Mrs. Clinton, if she became president, would confront him over his claims. She acknowledged at one point that the administration had gotten distracted from its “pivot” to Asia. In North Korea, the situation has worsened much more drastically. She summarized the Chinese message to the North Koreans this way: “We don’t care if you occasionally shoot off a missile. That’s good. That upsets the Americans and causes them heartburn, but you can’t keep going down a path that is unpredictable. ” That, of course, is exactly the path they have gone down."
22134,"Showing Confidence, Hillary Clinton Pushes Into Republican Strongholds - The New York Times",New York Times,Matt Flegenheimer and Jonathan Martin,M,2016-10-19,2016.0,10.0,,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is planning its most ambitious push yet into traditionally   states, a new offensive aimed at extending her growing advantage over Donald J. Trump while bolstering   candidates in what party leaders increasingly suggest could be a sweeping victory for Democrats at every level. Signaling extraordinary confidence in Mrs. Clinton’s electoral position and a new determination to deliver a punishing message to Mr. Trump and Republicans about his racially tinged campaign, her aides said Monday that she would aggressively compete in Arizona, a state with a growing Hispanic population that has been ground zero for the country’s heated debate over immigration. Mrs. Clinton is “dramatically expanding” her efforts in Arizona, her campaign manager, Robby Mook, told reporters on Monday. She is pouring more than $2 million into advertising and dispatching perhaps her most potent surrogate, Michelle Obama, for a rally in Phoenix on Thursday. In Indiana and Missouri, Mr. Mook said, the campaign will spend a total of $1 million to drive voter turnout, despite what he acknowledged was an “uphill battle” for Mrs. Clinton in two states that could determine control of the Senate. Mrs. Clinton is also directing more money to a series of presidential battleground states with competitive House races. The maneuvering speaks to the unexpected tension facing Mrs. Clinton as she hurtles toward what aides increasingly believe will be a decisive victory  —   a pleasant problem, for certain, but one that has nonetheless scrambled the campaign’s strategy weeks before Election Day: Should Mrs. Clinton maximize her own margin, aiming to flip as many red states as possible to run up an electoral landslide, or prioritize the party’s congressional fortunes, redirecting funds and energy down the ballot? Thanks to an infusion of contributions in recent weeks, and what aides describe as a war chest they had maintained in case the opportunity arose, Mrs. Clinton is in effect trying to do both. The   assault illustrates her priorities three weeks before Election Day. She hopes to hand Mr. Trump a loss so humiliating that it jars him and Republicans, removing any doubt about the wisdom of running on a   platform. But she also is demonstrating to the congressional Democrats with whom she may soon be working that she is also is dedicated to expanding their ranks. “I think it’s an act of good will, because her numbers look good and some of our races are tighter,” said Representative Dina Titus of Nevada, one of the states receiving cash. “But it’s also an important move, because she’s going to need friends to get her appointments approved, to have our help breaking through the obstruction on the other side to get legislation through. ” After nearly eight years in which Democrats on Capitol Hill grumbled about a lack of such support from President Obama, Mrs. Clinton has taken care to stay in frequent contact with Senator Chuck Schumer, her former New York colleague, about   races. Mr. Schumer, poised to be the incoming Senate Democratic leader, and the current leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, met with Mrs. Clinton’s top campaign aides in Washington last month and pressed them to offer financial support for the Senate races, according to a Democratic official briefed on the meeting. And Mr. Schumer has not been shy since about his hope that if Mrs. Clinton clearly appeared on her way to winning the race, she would redirect some money to congressional races. “This is one of many things that the Clinton campaign is doing to help us win a majority in the Senate,” Mr. Schumer said through a spokesman. While party strategists are glad to have the money that Mrs. Clinton is directing from the Democratic National Committee to   efforts in Indiana and Missouri, they have little appetite for Mrs. Clinton to visit those states, where she is likely to lose, because that would make it easier for Republicans to tie Democratic Senate candidates to her. Mrs. Clinton is also pouring money into two congressional districts, in Nebraska and Maine, that both apportion their own presidential electoral vote and have competitive House races. And she is sending an additional $6 million to seven presidential battleground states with hotly contested Senate and House campaigns. Democrats are also attempting to unseat Senator John McCain of Arizona from the seat he was first elected to in 1986, but Mrs. Clinton’s late decision to swoop into that state is not related to his race, which few Democratic leaders believe they can win. Her incursion there is about her own campaign  —   and the Democrats’ desire to focus attention on the damage Mr. Trump has done to Republicans with Hispanics. In particular, Democrats hope to make an example of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an ardent Trump supporter, by defeating the Phoenix lawman, whose incendiary comments about Hispanics and aggressive tactics with immigrants have garnered attention far beyond his jurisdiction in Maricopa County. “If Democrats were going to win in Arizona in 2016, you’d need a Republican who turns off Republican women, who really energizes Latinos, and you’d need other races on the ground that can really drive engagement  —   and we have all that,” said Andrei Cherny, a former state Democratic chairman. Alexis Tameron, the current state Democratic chairwoman, said Republican stumbles had allowed local Democrats to “jump our own timeline” for when officials expected to make the state competitive on the presidential level. “I give credit where credit is due,” Ms. Tameron said. “And I have been thanking a lot of people, including Donald Trump. ” Mr. Trump’s campaign did not respond to messages seeking comment on Mrs. Clinton’s plans. Mrs. Clinton’s team had weighed for weeks how seriously to look beyond core battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina, another state that Republicans carried in 2012. Eager to torment Mr. Trump, and the Republicans straining to navigate his erratic bid, her team has also planned at least faint,   plays in other states with little history of Democratic success. In Texas, the campaign has prepared an ad highlighting Mrs. Clinton’s endorsement from The Dallas Morning News. And Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, has begun sitting for local media interviews in Utah, where Mr. Trump has struggled to break away from Mrs. Clinton and an independent candidate, Evan McMullin, in recent polls. (On a conference call with reporters on Monday, Mr. Mook mentioned Mr. McMullin by name.) The most brazen push, though, is in Arizona, where the campaign has also scheduled appearances on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf from her daughter, Chelsea, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Mook added that Mrs. Clinton may appear there herself in short order. “We certainly hope to get her there,” he said. Mrs. Clinton’s aides were intrigued by both Arizona and Georgia, and they surveyed voters in each state. Arizona appeared more promising, officials said, because of its combination of Mormons, Hispanics and Native Americans and because the officials found white voters in Georgia to be more resistant to Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton has more conspicuously emphasized congressional and state races during campaign appearances, taking particular care to mention fellow Democrats on the ballot. Some Republicans seem inclined to capitalize on the attention. A   email on Monday from Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican in a competitive   race in Florida, went out under the subject line “Hillary wants me gone. ” “Hillary Clinton’s campaign has SO much money on its hands,” the message read, “that they are now focusing on   races instead of her own campaign. ”"
22160,"Donations to Foundation Vexed Hillary Clinton’s Aides, Emails Show - The New York Times",New York Times,Steve Eder and Amy Chozick,B,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,,"In the years before Hillary Clinton announced she would run again for president, her top aides expressed profound concerns in internal emails about how foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton’s own moneymaking ventures would affect Mrs. Clinton’s political future. The emails, obtained by hackers and being gradually released by WikiLeaks this month, also are revealing how efforts to minimize potential conflicts at the foundation led to power struggles and infighting among aides and Mrs. Clinton’s family. One top aide to Mr. Clinton, Douglas J. Band, noted in an email that the former president had received personal income from some foundation donors and “gets many expensive gifts from them. ” Chelsea Clinton accused her father’s aides of taking “significant sums of money from my parents personally,” of “hustling” during foundation events to win clients for their own business, and of even installing spyware on her chief of staff’s computer. Hillary Clinton, another email showed, had promised to attend a Clinton Foundation gathering in Morocco at the behest of its king, who had pledged $12 million to the charity. Her advisers worried that would look unseemly just as she was beginning her presidential campaign in earnest. “She created this mess and she knows it,” a close aide, Huma Abedin, wrote of Mrs. Clinton in a January 2015 email. For months, the Clintons have defended their foundation, making public proclamations that it went above and beyond what the law required in terms of transparency while Mrs. Clinton was at the State Department. The emails, which came from the account of John D. Podesta, who had a leadership role at the foundation and is now Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, have not contained evidence to support Republican contentions that Mrs. Clinton performed any favors for foundation donors. But they do show pronounced worries among the Clintons’ closest advisers about the millions of dollars coming into the foundation, and to Mr. Clinton personally, and how they could inoculate Mrs. Clinton from criticism over it. “Do they plan to do big events next year?” her campaign manager, Robby Mook, asked about the foundation last year, shortly after Mrs. Clinton kicked off her presidential campaign. “Possible for those to be smaller and lower key in 16?” Founded in 1997, when Mr. Clinton was still president, the foundation has raised roughly $2 billion to fund projects around the world, helping African farmers improve their yields, Haitians recover from a devastating 2010 earthquake and millions of people gain access to cheaper H. I. V.  medication, among other accomplishments. Some of the former president’s staff members followed him from the White House to the foundation, and the emails provide an extraordinary look at the soap opera that unfolded years later as people close to the couple felt their power threatened. “This is the 3rd time this week where she has gone to daddy to change a decision or interject herself,” Mr. Band, the longtime aide to Mr. Clinton, wrote about Chelsea Clinton in 2011. At the time, she was beginning to exert influence at the foundation, expressing concerns that Mr. Band and others were trying to use the charity to make money for themselves, and accusing another aide in her father’s personal office of installing spyware. Emails released on Tuesday contained a memo from Mr. Band essentially defending his work for the foundation, and for Mr. Clinton personally, even as Mr. Band was building up his corporate consulting firm, Teneo. The memo noted that some foundation donors had indeed been clients of Teneo, but also that Mr. Band and Teneo had helped raise tens of millions of dollars for the foundation from individual, foreign and corporate donors, without taking a commission. Mr. Band also noted how some of those donors he had cultivated were paying Mr. Clinton privately to make speeches or to do other work. One such donor, Laureate International Universities, a   education company based in Baltimore, was paying Mr. Clinton $3. 5 million annually “to provide advice” and serve as its honorary chairman, Mr. Band wrote. In another email, Mr. Band wrote that Mr. Clinton had even received gifts from some donors. The tensions came to a head when Chelsea Clinton helped enlist an outside law firm to audit the Clinton Foundation’s practices. Some interviewees told the audit team that the donors “may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gift. ” The audit suggested the foundation “ensure that all donors are properly vetted and that no inappropriate quid pro quos are offered to donors in return for contributions. ” The advice proved prescient as Mrs. Clinton faced intense scrutiny about whether donors to the Clinton Foundation had received special access to her State Department or other rewards. In August, the foundation said it would no longer accept foreign donations should Mrs. Clinton win the White House. Mrs. Clinton has dismissed criticism of the charity as politically motivated. A spokesman for the Clinton campaign, Glen Caplin, declined to verify the authenticity of the emails, but said the hack was part of the Russian government’s efforts to use cyberattacks to influence the election in favor of the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump. Mr. Band’s firm released a statement saying: “Teneo worked to encourage clients, where appropriate, to support the Clinton Foundation because of the good work that it does around the world. It also clearly shows that Teneo never received any financial benefit or benefit of any kind from doing so. ” Behind the scenes, Mrs. Clinton’s aides grappled with how to sever her from the problematic optics of some of the philanthropy’s   practices. In an October 2014 email, Mr. Mook asked whether Mrs. Clinton’s name would be used in connection with the foundation, which is formally known as the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. “It will invite press scrutiny and she’ll be held accountable for what happens there,” he wrote. The next year, when Mrs. Clinton was on the verge of declaring her candidacy, Cheryl D. Mills, a lawyer and top aide, said she discussed with Mrs. Clinton various “steps” to take to adjust her relationship with the foundation, including her resignation from the foundation’s board. By fall 2015, Mrs. Clinton’s aides had   her response to questions about foreign donors. “As President, I won’t permit any conflicts between my work for the American people and the Foundation’s good work,” aides advised Mrs. Clinton to say in a coming debate. The emails give insight into the periodic fires that Mrs. Clinton’s advisers thought they had to put out. Mrs. Clinton ultimately did not attend the foundation event in Morocco that Ms. Abedin had complained about her husband and daughter did go. It is unclear if the king had given the $12 million he was said to have pledged he is not listed among the foundation’s donors. In March 2015, Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian steel magnate who had given more than $10 million to the foundation, was “relentlessly” requesting a meeting with Mr. Clinton, according to an aide, Amitabh Desai. If the former president declined, the relationship would be damaged, Mr. Desai wrote in an email. “No is better. Is that viable?” wrote Mr. Podesta, who by then was the chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. It is unclear if the meeting took place. That same year, during a discussion over a potential meeting between Mr. Clinton and the Saudi king, Mr. Podesta replied, using the former president’s initials, “Not something that would be on our top 10 list of WJC requests. ” Mr. Podesta took a leadership role at the charity when Bruce R. Lindsey, a former White House counsel and longtime friend of Mr. Clinton who had been chief executive of the foundation, had a stroke in 2011. His role at the foundation, coupled with his later capacity as the chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, put Mr. Podesta in the middle of internal workings of both operations and, by default, the delicate battles unfolding between Chelsea Clinton and her father’s top aides. The day Mrs. Clinton’s mother, Dorothy Rodham, died in 2011, Chelsea Clinton emailed Mr. Podesta. “Doug called and yelled and screamed at my Dad about how could he do this,” she said, a reference to the internal scrutiny going on at the foundation. “My mother is exhausted, we are all heartbroken but we need a strategy and my father needs  . ” Mr. Band has said the exchange described in the email never happened. Mr. Band, who helped Mr. Clinton build the foundation, clearly felt irritated by Chelsea Clinton’s stream of implications that he had padded his own pockets from his work for her father. When Chelsea Clinton, using a pseudonym “Diane Reynolds,” that she also sometimes used to check into hotels, sent Mr. Band a complimentary email in January 2012, he forwarded it to Mr. Podesta and Ms. Mills. “As they say, the apple doesn’t fall far,” he wrote. “A kiss on the cheek while she is sticking the knife in the back, and front. ”"
22189,"Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, North Dakota: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York Times",New York Times,Sean Alfano,M,2016-11-01,2016.0,11.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Trump and taxes. The Times obtained documents that show that Donald J. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income in the early 1990s by using a maneuver that his lawyers warned would most likely be deemed improper by an I. R. S. audit. “Whatever loophole existed was not ‘exploited’ here, but stretched beyond any recognition,” said one of the tax experts who reviewed the documents. Here’s how Mr. Trump structured his companies to gain personal tax advantages. • Clinton and emails. The F. B. I. is using a special computer program to see if recently discovered emails belonging to a top aide to Hillary Clinton contained classified information. The software should show whether the messages were already examined during the inquiry into Mrs. Clinton’s private server, officials said. James B. Comey’s decision to start the new review so close to Election Day has led some historians to draw parallels between the F. B. I. director and an infamous predecessor: J. Edgar Hoover, who ordered the bureau to wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. • Interview with Bashar  . The Syrian president rejected any personal responsibility for the war raging in his country, and placed all the blame on the U. S. and on Islamic militants, during a recent interview with our reporter. Mr. Assad also said he will remain in office until at least 2021, when his third   term ends. • North Dakota oil pipeline protests. Demonstrators in the monthslong fight against the $3. 7 billion Dakota Access project say it will threaten water supplies, and members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe say it violates their right to sacred land. The protests have led to numerous clashes with local law enforcement. We interviewed a protester and a sheriff’s deputy to explore both sides of the debate. • Pope attempts to heal religious rift. Pope Francis was in Sweden on Monday to observe the 499th anniversary of Martin Luther’s protest of the sale of indulgences, which set off more than a century of religious warfare and forever changed the practice of Christianity. The pope noted the positive impact of Luther’s actions on Catholicism. “The Protestant Reformation helped give greater centrality to sacred Scripture in the church’s life,” he said. • Physical triumphs. “Having something foreign in my body after a cancer diagnosis is the last thing I wanted,” said Debbie Bowers, a breast cancer survivor. “I just wanted to heal. ” She is one of a growing number of women “going flat” rather than having additional surgery to reconstruct their breasts. Separately, we spent time with competitors in a megatriathlon race that requires 703 miles of swimming, biking and running over five days. “This is not good for my body,” one participant said, “but it is good for my soul. ” • The yogurt company Chobani and its founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, have been criticized for hiring refugees and are being targeted by racist attacks on social media. “He’s the xenophobe’s nightmare,” the executive director of Human Rights Watch said. “Here’s an immigrant who isn’t competing for jobs, but is creating jobs big time. ” • The tech billionaire Peter Thiel defended his support of Mr. Trump in a speech on Monday, and said that Silicon Valley was out of touch with most of the country. “I think the truth has been more one of specific success but more general failure,” he said, suggesting that the tech industry had not done much for people outside of Silicon Valley. • What happens to all the leftover Halloween candy? Buyback programs and donation drives for charities help absorb the surplus. • U. S. stocks were slightly down on Monday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Be transported. We’re introducing a series of immersive 360 videos that let you experience Times journalism in a powerful new way. The first offers a rare glimpse of   Yemen after a deadly airstrike. Watch it here. • New to read. The ranks of the literary detective are getting a new member. His name is Isaiah Quintabe (the book is titled “IQ”) and he’s from the same part of Long Beach, Calif. as Snoop Dogg. Our reviewer calls Quintabe a “fine, durable character for the long run. ” We also recently reviewed the latest horror novels, and six new thrillers for fall. • World Series, Game 6. The Cleveland Indians can win their first title since 1948 tonight (8 p. m. Eastern, Fox) or the Chicago Cubs can force a    Game 7. Either way, relief pitching has been the dominant story of the series, our columnist writes. • Recipes of the day. Learn how to master two   side dishes: roasted vegetables and fried rice. Halloween may be over in the United States, but Mexico and Central America are celebrating Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. Hundreds of years ago, the Aztecs of that region honored their dead with elaborate rituals in the summer. The invading Spanish could not stamp out the tradition, and it was eventually merged with the Roman Catholic holidays of All Saints Day (Nov. 1) and All Souls Day the next day. Decorative skulls made of sugar are the most famous symbols of the holiday. They’re sometimes eaten or used on masks and dolls to represent the sweetness of life. People honoring Day of the Dead also visit the graves of their relatives and build ofrendas, or small altars with flowers and gifts, inside their homes. On Saturday, Mexico City hosted its first official Día de los Muertos parade. The inspiration: last year’s James Bond movie. “Spectre” begins with a chase through a Day of the Dead parade, and Mexican officials saw an opportunity to promote the capital city. Tens of thousands of people attended the parade. Among the marchers was a troupe dressed as Aztec warriors on   skates. “It would be hard to conserve these traditions without any changes,” its leader said. Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

We’re trying something new for our readers in Asia and Australia: a morning briefing to   your day.  What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here’s what you need to know: • The polls have closed in much of the United States. Donald J. Trump has won the crucial battleground states of Florida and Ohio along with more than 20 other states, leaving Hillary Clinton only a narrow path to the presidency. Check here for the latest numbers. Our reporters are providing   election analysis, and we’re offering unlimited access to The Times through Thursday morning. _____ • Markets in Asia were trading lower  —   Japan’s stocks plunged  —   and the prospect of a Wall Street   rose after Mr. Trump’s unexpectedly strong showing. For the first time in modern memory, both candidates are watching the results in Midtown Manhattan  —   though across town from one another. • The Philippines’ highest court ruled that Ferdinand E. Marcos, the former dictator ousted by his people after a brutal   rule, can be reburied in a heroes cemetery, as planned by President Rodrigo Duterte. The Marcos family welcomed the ruling and so did supporters, above, but many Filipinos expressed hurt and anger. A senator said the court had “miserably failed the test of history and broken our hearts. ” • Hundreds of lawyers marched through Hong Kong’s central business district in a silent show of opposition to China’s assertion of power over the city’s judiciary. Some noted that local courts, which operate on common law, could still soften or even stymie the implementation of Beijing’s decision to block two   politicians from taking office. _____ • South Korea’s president, Park   is allowing her rivals in Parliament to pick a new prime minister in place of her own nominee, her latest attempt to defuse an   scandal. Prosecutors also raided the offices of Samsung, South Korea’s largest conglomerate, to investigate possible links to the scandal. Corruption has become a pressing issue for the country amid slowing economic growth. _____ • Ferocious battles have turned parts of the Syrian city of Aleppo into a moonscape of shattered buildings. Our reporter made a recent bus tour of the western,   part of the city, documenting scenes of stark destruction as well as the almost surreal contrast of seemingly normal life. _____ • India’s   notes are now worthless. Prime Minister Narendra Modi devalued the   and   bills because they are frequently counterfeited or used for graft. • Iran signed its first major deal with a Western oil company since international sanctions were removed in the nuclear agreement. The preliminary $4. 8 billion deal with Total calls for the production of 1. 8 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. • American environmental groups protesting the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation are targeting a new group: banks that have helped finance the project. • Adjoining apartments in Hong Kong sold for an Asian record of more than $13, 500 per square foot. •  Here’s a snapshot of global markets, which have been shaken by the American election. • A British banker was found guilty of murdering two Indonesian women at his luxury Hong Kong apartment, a case that exposed the underbelly of the city’s financial sector. [The New York Times] • Singapore’s prime minister said only Malay candidates would be allowed to run in next year’s presidential race, to ensure there would be a president from the minority group for the first time in more than 46 years. [The Straits Times] • Hungary’s Parliament rejected a proposal to bar refugees being relocated from the rest of Europe. [The New York Times] • Iraqi troops advancing on Mosul discovered a mass grave containing about 100 bodies, many of them decapitated. [The Associated Press] • A manhunt is on for two inmates who made an   escape from a London prison. [The New York Times] • Take a glimpse of Yarchen Gar, China, a wonder of the Tibetan highlands populated by Buddhist nuns. [The New York Times] • Two hundred mahouts and 11 elephants, powdered an auspicious white, paid respects to King Bhumibol, who died last month, at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. [Bangkok Post] • Prince Harry has had enough. The    grandson of Queen Elizabeth II blasted British news coverage and social media trolls for the “outright sexism and racism” unleashed on his biracial American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, above. • Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League is trying to make ice hockey popular in China, where the sport’s traditional rowdiness seems not to have translated. • Iran, after years of isolation, global sanctions and bad press, is blossoming as a tourist destination for travelers from Europe, and even the United States, looking to explore the unknown. • Toblerone, the Swiss chocolate bar, has altered the   shape of two of its products. The redesign, which shrinks weight to avoid raising the price, has outraged some fans. “It is one of the most extraordinary works of art to come to the market in the last 10 to 15 years. ” That comment by Sotheby’s chairman for Chinese art was reserved for an   musket made for the Qianlong emperor, who presided over what became China’s last imperial dynasty. The gun is set to be auctioned today in London at an estimated price of roughly $1. 2 million to $1. 8 million. “We’ve never had an imperial firearm,” the Sotheby’s executive, Nicolas Chow, said. Handcrafted out of wood, with components made of gold, silver and copper, the gun is over five and a half feet long. An inscription reads, “Supreme Number One. ” Sales of Chinese art accounted for nearly a third of the global art auction market last year, according to a recent analysis. Mr. Chow said that many treasures were taken from the palace after the dynasty ended. Their return is viewed as a matter of national pride. The emperor’s fondness for the weapon can be seen in a poem attributed to him, but a jade seal he used during his abdication might be the emperor’s most valuable possession. Last month, an anonymous buyer paid nearly $12 million for the item. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

22260,Highlights of Hillary Clinton’s Concession Speech and President Obama’s Remarks - The New York Times,New York Times,Alan Rappeport and Alexander Burns,M,2016-11-09,2016.0,11.0,,"Hillary Clinton publicly conceded the election to Donald J. Trump on Wednesday, acknowledging the pain of the defeat in remarks in New York while calling on her supporters to accept that he would be president and give him a chance to lead with an open mind. President Obama, speaking in Washington, also said that he would work to ensure a smooth transition to a Trump administration and that, despite their differences, we are “all rooting for his success. ” Speaker Paul D. Ryan proclaimed that Mr. Trump had achieved a political feat and earned a mandate by reaching new voters. Mr. Ryan said that he was certain that they would work well together on a conservative policy agenda. Global markets swooned overnight but stabilized as investors considered the possibility that Mr. Trump’s mix of policies might bolster the economy.. News of Mr. Trump’s election was met with a mix of shock, uncertainty and some congratulations around the world. • Mrs. Clinton thanked her supporters in her concession speech, and said that she felt pride in the campaign she ran. • Of Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton said she hoped that he would be “a successful president for all Americans,” and that she respected and cherished the peaceful transition of power. She told her supporters that they must accept that Mr. Trump would be president. “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,” she said. But she also acknowledged that the country was more divided than she had realized. • After a long campaign, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that the loss cuts deep. “This is painful, and it will be for a long time,” she said. She also expressed regret that she did not shatter the glass ceiling, but said, “Someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. ” • Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic   nominee, who spoke before Mrs. Clinton, said, “I’m proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history maker,” pointing to her long career of public service. He saluted her for winning the popular vote in the election, drawing cheers. • Mr. Obama said that he and former President George W. Bush had major differences eight years ago, but they managed a successful transition. He said he expected to do the same with Mr. Trump, while acknowledging that they have their differences, and he invited the   to come to the White House on Thursday. • Mr. Obama reminded the country that we “are all on the same team” and characterized politics as an “intramural scrimmage. ” He said that he was heartened by the conversation that he had with Mr. Trump at 3:30 a. m. and that he hoped Mr. Trump maintains that spirit. • Mr. Obama said that he was proud of Mrs. Clinton, who gave her concession speech on Wednesday just before Mr. Obama spoke, and called her a historic figure. • Mr. Obama called on Americans to move forward with the presumption of good faith in fellow citizens. He said that those who were disappointed should not give up on their dreams. “Sometimes you lose an argument, sometimes you lose an election,” he said, with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. by his side. “But the path this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag. ” The Vermont senator, who ran against Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary campaign, was silent on the election for most of Wednesday, but in the early evening he offered something of an olive branch to Mr. Trump and acknowledged the middle class anger that he tapped into. “To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,” Mr. Sanders said in a statement. But Mr. Sanders maintained that he is opposed to much of what Mr. Trump has stood for and that he will fight any intolerance that he might try to promote as president. “To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and   policies, we will vigorously oppose him,” Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Ryan congratulated Mr. Trump for accomplishing an “enormous political feat” on Wednesday and said that he was looking forward to working with him to carry forward a Republican policy agenda and prioritize the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “This health care law is not a popular law,” Mr. Ryan said, adding that Congress had already shown it can get a repeal bill to the president’s desk. “This health care law is collapsing of its own weight. ” That clearly indicated that Republican leaders would use budget rules, called reconciliation, to gut the Affordable Care Act with only a majority of Congress, as they did in January. Senate Democrats would be powerless to filibuster the legislation under the parliamentary rules. Mr. Ryan, who has had differences with Mr. Trump, said that they had spoken twice in the last 18 hours and that he was “very excited” about their ability to work together. “He just earned a mandate,” Mr. Ryan said. The last two Republican presidents gave the next Republican president congratulatory telephone calls on Wednesday. “Laura and I wish the   Melania and the entire Trump family all our very best as they take on an awesome responsibility and begin an exciting new chapter in their lives,” former President George W. Bush said in a statement. Mr. Bush had been critical of Mr. Trump when he was campaigning on behalf of his brother Jeb this year but said that he was rooting for Mr. Trump now. “We pray for the success of our country and the success of our new president,” Mr. Bush said. Mr. Bush’s father, George Bush, the 41st president, also spoke to Mr. Trump on Wednesday. A spokesman said that they talked for about five minutes and that the call was friendly and gracious. “Good luck on your new challenge,” Mr. Bush said. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor vanquished by Mr. Trump during the Republican primary process, sent Mr. Trump a congratulatory message on Twitter. Dozens of Republican elected officials resisted Mr. Trump’s rise to power, including some who revoked their endorsements in the heat of the general election. Senators like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona declared Mr. Trump unfit to lead, while ideological conservatives like Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mike Lee of Utah warned of Mr. Trump’s indifference to the limits of government power. These Trump critics on the right now face a wrenching political choice: to defer to him as the country’s new leader, or to take up a   role against a Republican as he assembles his administration. Since Republicans kept control of the House and Senate, dissenters within Mr. Trump’s party may hold outsize influence over exactly how he can govern as president. Mr. Graham took a reserved approach in his statement on the election on Tuesday, saying that he would aim to help Mr. Trump govern  —   within the bounds of a fairly conventional Republican agenda."
22454,Donald Trump Drops Threat of New Hillary Clinton Investigation - The New York Times,New York Times,Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear,B,2016-11-23,2016.0,11.0,,"Donald J. Trump said on Tuesday that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server or the financial operations of her family’s foundation, dropping the “lock her up” pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the White House. Mr. Trump, who branded his rival “Crooked Hillary” and said she would go to jail if he were president, said in an interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times that he was no longer interested in pursuing Mrs. Clinton, in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign. “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t,” Mr. Trump said during the interview. “She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, and I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. ” His reversal on prosecuting Mrs. Clinton was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential campaign, in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent theme, and one she has blamed for her loss to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump said he wanted to “move forward” from the subject. Without elaborating, he said that “we’ll have people that do things,” perhaps a reference to the F. B. I. or Republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases. But the   made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office. The decision angered some of his most fervent supporters, who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart. “Broken Promise,” blared the headline on Breitbart News, a conservative news site that has strongly backed Mr. Trump. “It’s not something that I feel very strongly about,” Mr. Trump said at The Times, unlike health care or immigration. “This has been a very painful period of time. ” Clinton aides did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump’s remarks. During their second debate, Mr. Trump turned to Mrs. Clinton and vowed, “If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there’s never been so many lies, so much deception. ” After Mr. Trump’s turnaround on Tuesday, the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, one of his staunchest supporters during the campaign, suggested on Twitter that Mr. Trump was overstepping his role. “Whoa! I thought we elected @realDonaldTrump president,” she wrote. “Did we make him the FBI,  DOJ? His job is to pick those guys, not do their jobs. ” Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of Mrs. Clinton, said on Tuesday that it would be a mistake for Mr. Trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use. Mr. Fitton said that although the F. B. I. had already investigated the matter twice, that inquiry was flawed. His group has gained access to thousands of pages of Mrs. Clinton’s State Department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last week on Fox News that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because “we’ve got to get to the truth. ” Mr. Chaffetz’s office said on Tuesday he was unavailable for comment about Mr. Trump’s statements. Although the F. B. I. ’s email investigation is closed, the agency still has an open inquiry into the Clinton Foundation. That inquiry began after the 2015 publication of “Clinton Cash,” a book by Peter Schweizer that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for State Department favors when Mrs. Clinton was there. The Clintons have denied the assertions. The F. B. I. and Justice Department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the White House, so Mr. Trump cannot tell agents to close their cases. A president ordering the F. B. I. to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal. “It does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that decision,” Glen A. Kopp, a former federal prosecutor in New York, said of the  . “I know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal matter. ” If, as president, Mr. Trump were to order the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, to close the foundation inquiry, Mr. Comey could choose to rebuff him. F. B. I. directors are given   terms to insulate them from political pressure, but the president still has the power to fire a director, as President Bill Clinton did with William S. Sessions in 1993 after a Justice Department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by Mr. Sessions. In an interview last week with CBS News’s “60 Minutes,” Mr. Trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss Mr. Comey over his handling of the Clinton email investigation, saying the director “may have had very good reasons for doing what he did. ” As a practical matter, though, Mr. Trump’s remarks will probably have little impact. The investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails is already closed and, while the one into her family’s foundation remains open, senior F. B. I. officials and career Justice Department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case. When the case comes up for review, senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it down, but it will not be because of Mr. Trump’s remarks. While the  ’s decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the F. B. I. who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they uncover, some legal experts applauded Mr. Trump’s decision to not pursue investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s emails or her family foundation. Rory K. Little, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said he was inclined to support both moves by Mr. Trump. A decision to shut down an investigation, he said, “is not out of step with constitutional constraints,” as the Constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes."
22855,Russia’s Hacks Followed Years of Paranoia Toward Hillary Clinton - The New York Times,New York Times,Max Fisher,M,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,,"Russia’s unprecedented intervention in the United States election came amid more than United   tension and Donald J. Trump’s praise of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. It also coincided with a growing belief, in Moscow, that Russia faced an imminent threat in Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Mrs. Clinton is viewed in Moscow as innately hostile to Russia. Widely held conspiracy theories portray her as seeking to foment unrest that will return Russia to the chaos and depression of the 1990s. Even many government technocrats view her with suspicion that at times verges on paranoia. She referred to these views at an event on Thursday, telling donors that Mr. Putin’s “personal beef” with her had driven Russia’s intervention in the American election. Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Institute of International Relations, based in Prague, said the Kremlin was consumed by something more urgent than petty revenge:  . “It’s not just they didn’t like Clinton, but they actually thought that she represented a threat,” he said, describing Russia’s actions as a matter of “policy, not pique. ” No one factor can fully explain Russia’s decision to hack and pass on Democratic emails, analysts say, and intelligence agencies appear divided on assessing Russian motives. But, in Moscow, fear of Mrs. Clinton has loomed as large or larger than any warmth for Mr. Trump. Mr. Putin accused Mrs. Clinton of instigating protests against him in late 2011. “She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,” he said, reflecting a widespread view in Moscow that Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, had sought to topple Russia’s government. Mr. Putin returned to the presidency a few months later, appearing to believe that the United States had engineered the Middle East’s descent into chaos and was targeting his country to be next. He put Mrs. Clinton at the center of these plots. Mrs. Clinton is indeed more hawkish than other Democrats, including toward Russia. In 2008, while a senator, she mocked President George W. Bush’s claim that he had looked into Mr. Putin’s soul. “I could have told him  —   he was a K. G. B. agent. By definition, he doesn’t have a soul,” Mrs. Clinton joked. The line is still remembered in Moscow. But the Kremlin’s views of Mrs. Clinton go beyond defining her as hawkish. They are also layered with a   Russian belief that American democracy promotion is a ploy to unseat unfriendly governments, that the United States remains bent on Russia’s destabilization or even destruction, and that there is an American hand behind nearly every Russian misfortune. These suspicions go back decades. But, since Mrs. Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, popular telling has cast her as the culprit responsible for America’s misdeeds and, therefore, Russia’s setbacks. In the summer of 2015, when Russian hacking groups first infiltrated Democratic National Committee servers, I happened to be reporting in Moscow. The American name on everyone’s lips was not Mr. Trump’s, who was already praising Mr. Putin, but rather Mrs. Clinton’s. Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian foreign policy commentator, told me at the time that there was a widespread view in his country’s government that Mrs. Clinton, as president, would take “a very hostile approach” toward Russia. Consensus in Moscow, Mr. Lukyanov said, was that “Hillary is the worst option of any president, maybe worse than any Republican. ” It was conventional wisdom, he added, that Mrs. Clinton considered her husband’s efforts to reform Russia in the 1990s an unfinished project, and that she would seek to finish it by encouraging   efforts that would culminate with regime change. This summer, when Russian hacking groups began releasing Democratic emails through third parties such as WikiLeaks, many Americans suspected an effort to help Mr. Trump, who had promised to realign the United States with Russia. But Mr. Galeotti, the Russian expert, said that, in all his time in Moscow, “I didn’t speak to anyone who thought a Trump presidency was possible. ” Rather, conversation there followed the same polls that dominated the discussion in America, and which all projected a landslide for Mrs. Clinton. Even as Mr. Putin deemed Mr. Trump “colorful” and suggested they might get along, officials in Moscow “were absolutely working from the assumption that Clinton was going to get it,” Mr. Galeotti said. This belief may have informed Russia’s actions during the campaign, which a number of analysts still suspect were aimed at weakening, rather then preventing, Mrs. Clinton’s presumedly imminent presidency. But if Moscow does gain an ally in Mr. Trump, it will lose a foil in Mrs. Clinton  —   something that has been politically useful for Mr. Putin as his country’s economy has sunk and its isolation deepened."
23073,"At Debate, Hillary Clinton Leaves Questions About Approach to Banks - The New York Times",New York Times,Peter Eavis,M,2016-04-15,2016.0,4.0,,"A jarring regulatory action this week against five large banks was bound to bring Wall Street to the fore in the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders differ on how to handle banks that are deemed “too big to fail. ” The complexities of bank regulation have made it hard for the candidates to express themselves clearly on Wall Street issues. Mr. Sanders, who is quite knowledgeable on the subject, nevertheless left some readers of a recent interview with The Daily News concerned that he wasn’t. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton might have left viewers with plenty questions about what she’d actually do to break up the banks. The banking discussion started with a question about the news that sent a chill through the large banks this week. Federal regulators rejected special plans that large banks now have to draw up to show how they would go through bankruptcy in an orderly fashion. Early in the debate, CNN’s Dana Bash noted that, if the five banks don’t fix the plans, the regulators could, as a last resort, require them to break up. Ms. Bash asked Mrs. Clinton: “So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks, something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?” “Absolutely,” Mrs. Clinton said. But what followed was not absolutely clear. Mrs. Clinton described two powers she would have under the   Act, the law Congress passed to overhaul the financial system. She said how these powers might be used to break up the banks. But she might have left viewers confused over when she could use them. Under one interpretation, Mrs. Clinton appeared to be saying that she would quickly use the powers to pressure the banks to get smaller  —   an aggressive stance that might win admiration from Mr. Sanders’s supporters. But it is also plausible that Mrs. Clinton was saying that, while her administration would emphasize a tough line on the banks, it would not actually use the   powers until a serious debacle started to occur in the banking sector. This would be a more reactive approach, and, if no banking disasters happened on Mrs. Clinton’s watch, it could leave the banks at more or less the size they are today. Here is what Mrs. Clinton said to Ms. Bash: “I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the tests under  . There are two sections there, and if they fail either one, that they’re a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you’re referring to, are inadequate. ” Mrs. Clinton added: “I have been standing up and saying continuously, ‘We have the law we’ve got to execute under it.’ So you’re right: I will move immediately to break up any financial institution. ” When Mrs. Clinton said “living wills,” she was referring to the special bankruptcy plans that five big banks drew up, but that failed to pass muster with regulators. If after two years, the banks have not fixed the deficiencies that the regulators identified, the regulators can require the banks to take steps that would make them smaller. But the five banks, which include JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, are now going to do everything they can to get their living wills in order. The last thing they want to do is give the regulators the right to demand that they downsize. So as things stand today, it is unlikely that Mrs. Clinton will get the chance to use the living wills to carry out a sweeping breakup of the biggest banks. Nor is the other test going to give the next president an    tool to dismantle large banks. This is the Kanjorski amendment, an obscure provision in   that is named for Paul Kanjorski, a former Democratic representative who helped design this part of the legislation. In her answer, Mrs. Clinton said the government would have the power to act with force when banks become “a grave risk to our economy. ” The Kanjorski amendment does just that. It gives a council of regulators the ability to determine that a large bank or financial firm poses a “grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. ” After a vote, the council can demand the bank take certain steps to reduce its riskiness, but if those are deemed inadequate, the council can tell the bank to sell assets. But if Mrs. Clinton were to use this power simply to break up the banks, and not because the system was in imminent danger, it would be viewed as a radical, even destabilizing, step. The chances of the Kanjorski amendment’s being used outside of an emergency to achieve broader policy goals are close to zero. Mrs. Clinton most likely knows this. And it may be why she favors legislation to do things that   cannot do. This is from her website: “As president, Clinton would pursue legislation that enhances regulators’ authorities under   to ensure that no financial institution is too large and too risky to manage. ” It adds: “If firms can’t be managed effectively, regulators would have the explicit statutory authorization to require that they reorganize, downsize or break apart. ” Getting Congress to pass a new law to break up the banks would be hard. But, as we have seen from looking closely at Mrs. Clinton’s assertions, the existing law does not make it easy."
23092,"Our Woman in New York: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on Friendly Turf - The New York Times",New York Times,Maggie Haberman,F,2016-04-19,2016.0,4.0,,"Maggie Haberman, a New York Times political correspondent, has devoted her journalistic career to two irresistible subjects: politics and New York City. At age 7, her first byline appeared in The Daily News it has now been published in all three New York dailies. A native of the Upper West Side who lives in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, she has covered 10 election cycles, from mayoral contests to presidential campaigns, including the 2016 race, which turns to New York on Tuesday for its primary. Join us for live primary updates. There have been pickles and pizzas, jeering crowds and pushy   and dashes out to Coney Island for hot dogs alongside scruffy, bearded rock stars. Campaigns in New York feel at times like a movable feast, with candidates gorging on local specialties as they move along city sidewalks, shaking hands and trying to avoid dripping grease on their shirts. And this presidential race, which once seemed so distant, has taken on a distinctly New York character in the prelude to Tuesday’s primary, and not just in its greasy diet. The campaign has captivated   New Yorkers, drawing tens of thousands out of their homes from the South Bronx to Staten Island, to take in what this city relishes: a big show. “Do women like Trump?” Donald J. Trump asked two female fans wearing “Make America Great Again” ball caps on Sunday, as he posed for a picture with them on Staten Island. Mr. Trump, who is heavily favored here in Tuesday’s primary, was holding one of his few official campaign events in the city. And the two Trump fans, who said they could not reveal their names because it would imperil their jobs, were ready for the occasion. Mr. Trump smiled as he stood for the snapshot with them, quietly murmuring that the giddy women and another man who pushed himself into the photograph needed to pipe down a bit. No matter, they were very happy to have met the leading Republican candidate. “He let us know that he loves us, too,” one of the women gushed. Mr. Trump was greeted like a hometown hero on Staten Island. Outside the Hilton Garden Inn, where he was to give a speech, the line to get in snaked for over 50 yards in the parking lot. About 1, 000 people made it inside. Mr. Trump seemed thrilled to be in the borough, if a little fuzzy on its charms. Asked by a reporter to identify his favorite local pizza place, he responded that there are “a lot” of them. He had worked on Staten Island as a youngster for four summers, he told the assembled press corps  —   although, ever the salesman, he increased it to “probably five” summers by the time he spoke to the Staten Island crowd in the next room. His lowly job? Collecting coins from laundry machines at one of his father’s buildings. Watching Mr. Trump take the stage in that ballroom, with people standing on chairs to hear him, was a reminder of why he is doing so well in the Republican primary. The borough is an enclave of   voters, police officers and firefighters. And, setting aside his gilded towers and   airplane   Mr. Trump talks and sounds more like his   fans than the city’s last Republican mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg. I once watched Mr. Bloomberg draw cringes from a Staten Island crowd when he joked that he was the only politician present not to have a vowel at the end of his name. The battle for Brooklyn between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is intense, and Mrs. Clinton is counting on her deep support in the borough’s   neighborhoods to offset Mr. Sanders’s popularity among white liberals. At a block party in the   section on Sunday, she was praised by Representative James E. Clyburn, a   leader who traveled from his home state, South Carolina, for the occasion. There has not been an election in his lifetime, Mr. Clyburn told the crowd of about 200 people waiting in the hot sun, “that’s going to be more consequential than this one. ” Finally, Mrs. Clinton arrived and climbed the steps up to the bed of a red pickup truck that was being used as a stage. “Hello Brooklyn in the house, and on the street!” Mrs. Clinton called out to the crowd. The former secretary of state is comfortably ahead in the polls here, and she seems to be enjoying hopscotching around the state she represented for eight years in the Senate. But for all the warmhearted reminiscences, Mrs. Clinton has something to fear from Mr. Sanders on Tuesday. Around the time she visited   thousands gathered for a rally for Mr. Sanders in Prospect Park, the pristine patch of green wedged between   Crown Heights and upscale Park Slope. The actor Danny DeVito led the cheerful crowd in chants of “Bernie! Bernie!” and someone handed out copies of a fake newspaper with a banner headline reading “A Vote for Hillary Clinton Is a Vote for Donald Trump. ” The Sanders campaign said the crowd reached 28, 300, a record for its rallies. If you live here and have yet to see a candidate, you still have time. While the Republicans hold events on Monday in Maryland, Western New York and upstate (Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio will visit Schenectady, the city most likely to be misspelled by reporters) the Democrats are around. Mr. Sanders will hold a rally at Hunters Point South Park in Queens on Monday evening, for which doors open at 5 p. m. And Mrs. Clinton will address one of her core constituencies  —   women  —   at the New York Hilton Midtown. Doors open at noon."

Here’s the latest. 1.  Donald J. Trump trounced his Republican rivals in the New York primary, according to The Associated Press, and extended his delegate lead. The victory was a crucial one for Mr. Trump and again demonstrated the broad appeal of his populist message with Republican voters. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton was expected to do well in her adopted home state, and despite facing a strong challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders, she did. Her win puts Mr. Sanders on the defensive, facing an even larger deficit as he scrambles for delegates. _____ 3. A Taliban truck bombing in Afghanistan’s capital claimed at least 30 lives and wounded more than 300 people. It was the deadliest attack in Kabul since 2011, boosting fears about the militants’ ability and willingness to infiltrate cities as part of their annual spring offensive, which was announced last week. _____ 4. A federal appeals court ruled that Title IX, the federal law that bars gender discrimination in schools, protected the right of a transgender student in Virginia to use the restroom of his choice. The ruling comes amid a nationwide debate on that issue. The student said the decision “gives me hope that my fight will help other kids avoid discriminatory treatment at school. ” _____ 5. President Obama will pay a visit to a jittery Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The country’s leaders, reeling from low oil prices and competition with Iran, count the White House as another source of discomfort because they doubt that the president shares their vision for the Middle East. Their worry was compounded last month when he criticized the Saudis as “free riders. ” _____ 6. Hillary Clinton isn’t the only New Yorker with a distaste for MetroCards. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority outlined plans on Monday to replace the flimsy yellow cards, which were introduced in the New York City subways in 1993. But don’t throw out your extras just yet. The changes won’t go into effect until at least 2018. _____ 7. Google could face charges in Europe as soon as this week that it unfairly used its Android phone software to promote its own services, including maps and search, over competitors’. Although the company denies it breached any laws, the   charges would represent a major setback as it tries to strengthen its position in the global mobile market. _____ 8. Peter Liang, who was a New York City police officer when he fatally shot a    unarmed black man, Akai Gurley, in a Brooklyn housing project stairwell in 2014, avoided a prison term. He was instead sentenced in State Supreme Court to five years’ probation in the divisive police misconduct case, the exact punishment sought by the  prosecutor. Leaving the courtroom, Mr. Gurley’s aunt cried out: “There is no justice! Akai Gurley’s life didn’t matter!” _____ 9. To marijuana advocates, largely liberal New England is the natural next front for legalization. But given an epidemic of opiate abuse, the region’s authorities may be less than open to the idea of expanding access to any illicit substance. The Massachusetts attorney general, a Democrat, said the “effort at legalization seems to be directly at odds” with efforts to help addicts. _____ 10. Brett Weber is neither a player nor a coach for the Yankees, but he can have as much influence on the outcome of a game as anyone else in pinstripes. The team’s video replay monitor, Mr. Weber alerts the coaching staff to umpire calls he thinks should be challenged. Since replay began in 2014, the Yankees have had baseball’s highest success rate at overturning calls. _____ 11.

23107,Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Win Easily in New York Primary - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy and Maggie Haberman,B,2016-04-20,2016.0,4.0,,"Donald J. Trump wrested back control of the Republican presidential race on Tuesday with a commanding victory in the New York primary, while Hillary Clinton dealt a severe blow to Senator Bernie Sanders with an unexpectedly strong win that led her to declare that the Democratic nomination was “in sight. ” The     Mr. Trump was poised to take most of the 95 Republican delegates at stake, substantially adding to his current lead over Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and significantly improving his chances of winning the Republican nomination. Mr. Cruz came away with no delegates, a major setback, while Gov. John Kasich of Ohio had a shot at picking up some in Manhattan and the capital region. Mrs. Clinton’s decisive victory ended a string of wins by Mr. Sanders and gave her more delegates than her advisers expected. Her base of support was Long Island, the five boroughs, and upstate cities, with female and black and Hispanic voters turning out for her in especially strong numbers. The two hometown winners beamed throughout their victory speeches, but it was Mr. Trump who particularly seemed like a different candidate. As he spoke in the lobby of Trump Tower, there were no freewheeling presentations of steaks and bottled water, as in the past. There was no reference to “Lyin’ Ted” or “Crooked Hillary” he called his opponent “Senator Cruz” instead, and made no mention of Mrs. Clinton. He also took no questions from the news media. And his speech sounded more presidential than any other he has given on an election night  —   a focused, tightened message about trade and the economy as he prepares to campaign in states hit hard by manufacturing industry losses. The speech reflected the growing influence of Paul Manafort, whom Mr. Trump empowered to help him win the nomination and who has taken on a greater purview, including messaging. “Our jobs are being sucked out of our states,” Mr. Trump said. “One of the big problems is economy and jobs, and that is my wheelhouse. ” He said, twice, that he was going to get up and go back to work for the nomination on Wednesday morning, a clear message about the intensity he is bringing to the fight. In the Democratic race, Mrs. Clinton was set to win roughly 30 more delegates than Mr. Sanders, out of 247 at stake. She already had a lead of more than 200 delegates in the race. Smiling broadly throughout her victory speech, Mrs. Clinton drew cheers as she thanked her adopted home state and then boomed, “Today, you proved once again, there’s no place like home. ” “The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch and victory is in sight,” Mrs. Clinton added, reflecting the overwhelming mathematical advantage she has in delegates. Sanders advisers had said that beating Mrs. Clinton in her adopted home state represented one of their campaign’s best opportunities to damage her candidacy and sow doubts about her strength as a   nominee. On Tuesday, however, Mrs. Clinton drew deep support among women and blacks  —   two groups that have been essential for her in many states  —   while Mr. Sanders was outpacing her among white men and people under 45, according to exit polls. “Bernie Sanders got very negative attacking Hillary Clinton and dividing the party in New York, and I think he now has to ask himself if he wants to keep going down that path,” said Jay Jacobs, a Clinton supporter who is the Democratic chairman in Nassau County on Long Island. “After New York, we’re moving into a phase of the campaign where we have to start uniting the party. ” Mr. Sanders and his team spent Tuesday looking past New York. Mr. Sanders held a rally at Pennsylvania State University in State College on Tuesday night, then flew home to Burlington, Vt. and spoke to reporters just after the race was called. “There are five primaries next week and we think we are going to do well and we think we have a path toward victory,” Mr. Sanders said. He also expressed concern about the closed primary system in New York and said he hoped it would change in the future. “Some three million New Yorkers were unable to vote today because they were registered as independents,” Mr. Sanders said. “That makes no sense to me. ” The Sanders campaign spent roughly $2 million more than the Clinton campaign on television ads in New York. The magnitude of the loss  —   both in the popular vote and in delegates  —   was steep for Mr. Sanders, who said he intended to get “recharged and take a day off. ” The senator’s advisers were optimistic that he would perform strongly in next Tuesday’s primaries in Pennsylvania as well as in Rhode Island and Connecticut. The other two states voting next week, Delaware and Maryland, are widely seen as Clinton strongholds. The Sanders campaign is already running television ads in those five states and Indiana, which votes May 3. “Bernie is in good shape going forward no matter who wins New York,” said Tad Devine, a senior adviser on the Sanders campaign. “We could win enough delegates in Pennsylvania and Indiana to catch up further to her, and we have good opportunities all the way through California,” which votes June 7. Still, Mr. Devine acknowledged, “we’re going to have to have some big wins at the end” of the primary and caucus season. Mrs. Clinton, a former senator from New York, received support from roughly six in 10 Democrats on Long Island, and she overwhelmed Mr. Sanders in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. Mr. Sanders won many upstate rural counties, where few votes were cast, and he also did well in the Hudson Valley, given the enclaves of liberals and college students. On a major issue in their campaign, nearly   of Democratic primary voters said that Wall Street does more to hurt the American economy than to help it, and a majority of those voters backed Mr. Sanders. But Mrs. Clinton received even stronger support from those who said Wall Street helps the economy. By a slim margin, Republican primary voters also said that Wall Street does more to hurt the economy than help it. Within the Trump campaign on Tuesday night, euphoria mixed with eagerness to move onto a number of states that are likely to be friendly to Mr. Trump. There have been other pivotal points in the Trump campaign, moments when he was described as becoming newly serious. It never stuck with the famously     candidate. But Mr. Manafort is someone whom Mr. Trump views as something of a peer. No matter the margin of victory, New York Republicans gave Mr. Trump a restorative psychic boost after weeks when Mr. Cruz scored a big victory in the Wisconsin primary and outmaneuvered the Trump campaign in Colorado, Wyoming and elsewhere in winning and electing delegates backing his candidacy. Mr. Trump now has clear momentum heading into the next week’s primaries  —   so much so that he evinced fresh optimism on Tuesday about ultimately getting to the 1, 237 delegates needed to capture the nomination. “I think I’ll get there,” Mr. Trump said in an interview before the polls closed. New York has not been home to leading presidential candidates in both parties since the 1944 campaigns of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Thomas E. Dewey, so the voting by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump merited unusual news media coverage on Tuesday morning. As a light mist fell, Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton cast their votes at an elementary school in their adopted town of Chappaqua. As news photographers and cameramen kept encroaching on her while she tried to vote, Mrs. Clinton finally shooed them away. “Guys, it’s a private ballot,” she said. The Democratic vote was marred by major irregularities at polling places across Brooklyn. The city comptroller’s office announced that the Board of Elections had confirmed that more than 125, 000 Democratic voters in Brooklyn were dropped between November and this month, while about 63, 000 were added  —   a net loss that was not explained. Mayor Bill de Blasio described “the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters,” while the comptroller, Scott Stringer, said his office would audit the Board of Elections. Mr. Trump voted for himself midmorning in New York City, which he called “a great honor” as he entered his apartment building. In the interview later, Mr. Trump described the experience of seeing his name on the ballot, saying he was moved by the enormity of what it means. “It does sort of hit you,” he said. Mr. Trump won majorities in all regions except for rural upstate areas. Some Republicans questioned why Mr. Cruz spent so little time in upstate New York, where Mr. Trump’s support two weeks ago was softer than it appeared. Instead, Mr. Cruz devoted his time mostly to the city and to fundraising. The primary was a seminal moment for Mr. Trump, both tactically in terms of delegates needed to clinch the nomination, and mentally, as he tries to right the ship after a rough couple of weeks that prompted him to reshuffle his small team of advisers, adding the seasoned campaign hand, Mr. Manafort. The coming weeks will test whether Mr. Trump can temper his message and his style for a new phase of the race, one where running a traditional campaign matters more than his ability to rally crowds. Indeed, Mr. Trump’s tone throughout the day was focused on what he repeatedly called, in interviews, a “corrupt” and “rigged” nominating process. Alfonse M. D’Amato, the former United States senator and a backer of Mr. Kasich, said the New York results would be critical for Mr. Trump to rebound in his fight with Mr. Cruz. “This will give him momentum that he needs after his setbacks,” Mr. D’Amato said."
23111,Long Primary Carries Costs for Hillary Clinton: Money and Time - The New York Times,New York Times,Nicholas Confessore and Sarah Cohen,B,2016-04-22,2016.0,4.0,,"Hillary Clinton has burned through tens of millions of dollars to counter Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in states that are unlikely to be general election battlegrounds, delaying any pivot to the general election and shrinking her potential financial advantage over the eventual Republican nominee. While Mrs. Clinton has built a significant advantage in pledged delegates over Mr. Sanders in the Democratic nominating contest, her lead has come at a significant cost. She spent more than she raised in each of the first three months of the year, according to Federal Election Commission data, including more than $12 million on ads in March alone. According to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, Mrs. Clinton has spent at least $20 million on advertising in states like New York, Illinois and Massachusetts, money that could otherwise have been saved for the general election. Even as Mrs. Clinton’s campaign begins preparing for the general election in November, it has been forced to respond to an advertising blitz by Mr. Sanders, financed by a seemingly unending gusher of small donations. Mr. Sanders spent $46 million in March alone, according to campaign finance records released on Wednesday. Mr. Sanders poured more than $5 million into the expensive New York media market, according to media buyers, hoping to replicate his upset victory in Michigan. Mr. Sanders’s spending  —   and his ability to keep raising huge amounts of money even while slipping behind in delegates  —   is likely to intensify criticism from Democratic Party officials and leading donors, who now see Mr. Sanders as waging a costly and quixotic crusade at Mrs. Clinton’s expense. “He is making Hillary Clinton spend money that should be spent defeating the Republicans,” said John Morgan, a Florida trial lawyer who will host a Clinton   at his Lake Mary home next week. “Bernie Sanders has the real possibility of being the   Ralph Nader. All he’s doing now is hurting Hillary. ” The lengthening primary poses potential problems not just on the spending side of the ledger, but also has delayed a shift to raising money for the general election, where Mrs. Clinton lags well behind the pace set by President Obama during his 2012 campaign, according to data from the commission. Aides to Mrs. Clinton say they had always planned for an extended and   primary, hoping to avoid a repeat of her 2008 blunder, when  she had to lend  her  campaign millions of dollars to stay afloat after running short of primary cash. Much of Mrs. Clinton’s spending has gone to build   capabilities with data, in the field and prospecting for small donors that will pay continuing dividends through an increasingly likely fall campaign, they said, and Mrs. Clinton remained on budget for the primary race. Her campaign had $30. 8 million on hand. “We head into the homestretch of the primary in strong financial shape with the resources we need to continue to run a competitive race through the end of the primary and the road ahead,” said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager. But as the Clinton campaign and its allies see the challenge from Mr. Sanders fading and have grown more comfortable with their delegate lead, they are shifting some of their attention away from the primary and looking toward the general election, mapping out   plans and sharpening their message. The campaign has begun discussions with senior “bundlers”  —   donors who volunteer to collect checks from dozens of other donors  —   to step up contributions to the Hillary Victory Committee, a joint   effort with the Democratic National Committee and many state Democratic organizations. By directing her largest donors to give more to party organizations, Mrs. Clinton can sock away tens of millions of dollars that would benefit her campaign during a general election effort while avoiding the appearance of presumption that might come with raising general election money while Mr. Sanders remains in the race. The victory committee had raised $61 million through the end of March, according to commission filings, with most of the money ending up back in Mrs. Clinton’s campaign or at the Democratic National Committee. Much as Mr. Obama did in 2012, Mrs. Clinton’s team has used party contributions to the joint committee to subsidize some costs of her presidential campaign, including prospecting for small donors. Mr. Sanders attacked the arrangement this week as unethical, though campaign lawyers said it was legal. On Wednesday, fresh off a victory in the New York primary, the campaign hosted hundreds of bundlers for a conference at a Sheraton hotel in Manhattan, where some of Mrs. Clinton’s top advisers urged donors to focus on bolstering her   for the contest against Mr. Sanders. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign said it was remaining focused on primary dollars in part because that money  —   up to $2, 700 from each supporter  —   could be used during the general election, too, while general election contributions could not be spent until after the party’s convention in July. The shift in focus has been apparent in Mrs. Clinton’s messaging. In her advertisements, particularly in New York, Mrs. Clinton has started to turn her attention toward Donald J. Trump, who is leading the Republican field in delegates. Her first ad in the state took unsubtle jabs at the Republican   and a week later, she ran her first ad directly targeting Mr. Trump, explicitly criticizing his statements. The Clinton campaign also created and ran a   ad, titled “Una Bandera,” which recalled that Mr. Trump called immigrants criminals and rapists. The ad made no mention or allusion to Mr. Sanders or a Democratic primary until the end, when it asked people to vote on April 19. A “super PAC” backing Mrs. Clinton is preparing for the worst. Priorities USA Action raised $11. 8 million dollars in March and had $44. 7 million in cash on hand at the start of April, far ahead of the group’s pace during Mr. Obama’s   campaign. Some of the largest contributions in March came from the family of Haim Saban, an entertainment mogul, and James H. Simons, a billionaire investor who gave $3. 5 million. And the group has spent relatively little in the fight against Mr. Sanders, meaning it will enter the general election contest with a sizable campaign war chest. Banking on Mrs. Clinton’s increasingly likely victory in the Democratic primary contest, and those pledges, the group has begun reserving $125 million in television and digital advertising for the general election campaign  —   a significant sum this early in the race. “Priorities will be ready to fight back against the   onslaught Republicans are readying against Hillary Clinton,” said Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Priorities USA."
23122,How Hillary Clinton Became a Hawk - The New York Times,New York Times,Mark Landler,M,2016-10-11,2016.0,10.0,,"Hillary Clinton sat in the hideaway study off her ceremonial office in the State Department, sipping tea and taking stock of her first year on the job. The study was more like a den  —   cozy and   lined with bookshelves that displayed mementos from Clinton’s three decades in the public eye: a statue of her heroine, Eleanor Roosevelt a baseball signed by the Chicago Cubs star Ernie Banks a carved wooden figure of a pregnant African woman. The intimate setting lent itself to a   interview than the usual locale, her imposing outer office, with its marble fireplace, heavy drapes, crystal chandelier and ornate wall sconces. On the morning of Feb. 26, 2010, however, Clinton was talking about something more sensitive than mere foreign affairs: her relationship with Barack Obama. To say she chose her words carefully doesn’t do justice to the delicacy of the exercise. She was like a   technician, deciding which color wire to snip without blowing up her relationship with the White House. “We’ve developed, I think, a very good rapport, really positive    about everything you can imagine,” Clinton said about the man she described during the 2008 campaign as naïve, irresponsible and hopelessly unprepared to be president. “And we’ve had some interesting and even unusual experiences along the way. ” She leaned forward as she spoke, gesturing with her hands and laughing easily. In talking with reporters, Clinton displays more warmth than Obama does, though there’s less of an expectation that she might say something revealing. Clinton singled out, as she often would, the United Nations   meeting in Copenhagen the previous December, where she and Obama worked together to save the meeting from collapse. She brought up the Middle East peace proc ess, a signature project of the president’s, which she had been tasked with reviving. But she was understandably wary of talking about areas in which she and Obama split  —   namely, on bedrock issues of war and peace, where Clinton’s more activist philosophy had already collided in unpredictable ways with her boss’s instincts toward restraint. She had backed Gen. Stanley McChrystal’s recommendation to send 40, 000 more troops to Afghanistan, before endorsing a fallback proposal of 30, 000 (Obama went along with that, though he stipulated that the soldiers would begin to pull out again in July 2011, which she viewed as problematic). She supported the Pentagon’s plan to leave behind a residual force of 10, 000 to 20, 000 American troops in Iraq (Obama balked at this, largely because of his inability to win legal protections from the Iraqis, a failure that was to haunt him when the Islamic State overran much of the country). And she pressed for the United States to funnel arms to the rebels in Syria’s civil war (an idea Obama initially rebuffed before later, halfheartedly, coming around to it). That fundamental tension between Clinton and the president would continue to be a defining feature of her   tenure as secretary of state. In the administration’s first   meeting on Russia in February 2009, aides to Obama proposed that the United States make some symbolic concessions to Russia as a gesture of its good will in resetting the relationship. Clinton, the last to speak, brusquely rejected the idea, saying, “I’m not giving up anything for nothing. ” Her hardheadedness made an impression on Robert Gates, the defense secretary and George W. Bush holdover who was wary of a changed Russia. He decided there and then that she was someone he could do business with. “I thought, This is a tough lady,” he told me. A few months after my interview in her office, another split emerged when Obama picked up a secure phone for a weekend conference call with Clinton, Gates and a handful of other advisers. It was July 2010, four months after the North Korean military torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, sinking it and killing 46 sailors. Now, after weeks of fierce debate between the Pentagon and the State Department, the United States was gearing up to respond to this brazen provocation. The tentative plan  —   developed by Clinton’s deputy at State, James Steinberg  —   was to dispatch the aircraft carrier George Washington into coastal waters to the east of North Korea as an unusual show of force. But Adm. Robert Willard, then the Pacific commander, wanted to send the carrier on a more aggressive course, into the Yellow Sea, between North Korea and China. The Chinese foreign ministry had warned the United States against the move, which for Willard was all the more reason to press forward. He pushed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, who in turn pushed his boss, the defense secretary, to reroute the George Washington. Gates agreed, but he needed the commander in chief to sign off on a decision that could have political as well as military repercussions. Gates laid out the case for diverting the George Washington to the Yellow Sea: that the United States should not look as if it was yielding to China. Clinton strongly seconded it. “We’ve got to run it up the gut!” she had said to her aides a few days earlier. (The Vince Lombardi imitation drew giggles from her staff, who, even 18 months into her tenure, still marveled at her pugnacity.) Obama, though, was not persuaded. The George Washington was already underway changing its course was not a decision to make on the fly. “I don’t call audibles with aircraft carriers,” he said  —   unwittingly   Clinton on her football metaphor. It wasn’t the last debate in which she would side with Gates. The two quickly discovered that they shared a Midwestern upbringing, a taste for a stiff drink after a long day of work and a   skepticism about the intentions of America’s foes. Bruce Riedel, a former intelligence analyst who conducted Obama’s initial review on the Afghanistan war, says: “I think one of the surprises for Gates and the military was, here they come in expecting a very    administration, and they discover that they have a secretary of state who’s a little bit right of them on these issues  —   a little more eager than they are, to a certain extent. Particularly on Afghanistan, where I think Gates knew more had to be done, knew more troops needed to be sent in, but had a lot of doubts about whether it would work. ” As Hillary Clinton makes another run for president, it can be tempting to view her   rhetoric about the world less as deeply felt core principle than as calculated political maneuver. But Clinton’s   instincts are bred in the bone  —   grounded in cold realism about human nature and what one aide calls “a textbook view of American exceptionalism. ” It set her apart from her    Barack Obama, who avoided military entanglements and tried to reconcile Americans to a world in which the United States was no longer the undisputed hegemon. And it will likely set her apart from the Republican candidate she meets in the general election. For all their bluster about bombing the Islamic State into oblivion, neither Donald J. Trump nor Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has demonstrated anywhere near the appetite for military engagement abroad that Clinton has. “Hillary is very much a member of the traditional American   establishment,” says Vali Nasr, a   strategist who advised her on Pakistan and Afghanistan at the State Department. “She believes, like presidents going back to the Reagan or Kennedy years, in the importance of the military  —   in solving terrorism, in asserting American influence. The shift with Obama is that he went from reliance on the military to the intelligence agencies. Their position was, ‘All you need to deal with terrorism is N. S. A. and C. I. A. drones and special ops.’ So the C. I. A. gave Obama an angle, if you will, to be simultaneously hawkish and shun using the military. ” Unlike other recent presidents  —   Obama, George W. Bush or her husband, Bill Clinton  —   Hillary Clinton would assume the office with a long record on national security. There are many ways to examine that record, but one of the most revealing is to explore her   cultivation of the military  —   not just civilian leaders like Gates, but also its   commanders, the men with the medals. Her affinity for the armed forces is rooted in a lifelong belief that the calculated use of military power is vital to defending national interests, that American intervention does more good than harm and that the writ of the United States properly reaches, as Bush once put it, into “any dark corner of the world. ” Unexpectedly, in the bombastic,   presidential election of 2016, Hillary Clinton is the last true hawk left in the race. For those who know Clinton’s biography, her embrace of the military should come as no surprise. She grew up in the buoyant aftermath of World War II, the daughter of a Navy petty officer who trained young sailors before they shipped out to the Pacific. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was a staunch Republican and an anticommunist, and she channeled his views. She talks often about her girlhood dream of becoming an astronaut, citing the rejection letter she got from NASA as the first time she encountered gender discrimination. Her real motive for volunteering, she has written, may have been because her father fretted that “America was lagging behind Russia. ” Political conversion came later, after Vietnam and the ’60s swept over Wellesley College, where she spoke out against the establishment at her graduation. But even in the tumultuous year of 1968, she was still making her transition from Republican to Democrat, managing to go to the conventions of both parties. As a Republican intern in Washington that summer, she questioned a Wisconsin congressman, Melvin Laird, about the wisdom of Lyndon B. Johnson’s escalating involvement in Southeast Asia. It was after law school that she had her most curious encounter with the military. In 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton, she stopped in at a Marine recruiting office in Arkansas to inquire about joining the active forces or reserves. She was a lawyer, she explained maybe there was some way she could serve. The recruiter, she recalled two decades later, was a young man of about 21, in prime physical condition. Clinton was then 27, freshly transplanted from Washington, teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and wearing   eyeglasses. “You’re too old, you can’t see and you’re a woman,” he told her. “Maybe the dogs will take you,” he added, in what she said was a pejorative reference to the Army. “It was not a very encouraging conversation,” Clinton said at a lunch for military women on Capitol Hill in 1994. “I decided, Maybe I’ll look for another way to serve my country. ” Some reporters have cast doubt on the veracity of this story, which she repeated in the fall of 2015 over breakfast with voters in New Hampshire: certainly, there’s no concrete evidence that it happened, and Bill gave a different account of it in 2008, substituting the Army for the Marines. Why would a professionally minded Yale Law graduate, on the cusp of marriage, suddenly want to put on a uniform? It’s impossible to decipher her possible motives, but Ann Henry, an old friend who taught at the university after Clinton moved to Little Rock, offers a theory: During those days, she recalls, female faculty members, as an exercise, would test the boundaries of careers that appeared closed to women. “I don’t think it’s made up,” she says. “It was consistent with something she would have done. ” Clinton’s next sustained exposure to the military did not come until she was first lady, almost two decades later. Living in the White House is, in many ways, like living in a military compound. A Marine stands guard in front of the West Wing when the president is in the Oval Office. The Mili tary Office operates the medical center and the telecommunications system. The Navy runs the cafeteria, the Marines transport the president by helicopter, the Air Force by plane. Camp David is a naval facility. The daily contact with men and women in uniform, Clinton’s friends say, deepened her feelings for them. In March 1996, the first lady visited American troops stationed in Bosnia. The trip became notorious years later when she claimed, during the 2008 campaign, to have dodged sniper fire after her   military plane landed at an American base in Tuzla. (Chris Hill, a diplomat who was onboard that day and later served as ambassador to Iraq under Clinton, didn’t remember snipers at all, and indeed recalled children handing her bouquets of spring flowers.) But there was no faking the good vibes during her tour of the mess and rec halls. With her teenage daughter at her side, she bantered and joked with the young servicemen and women  —   an experience, she wrote, that “left lasting impressions on Chelsea and me. ” When Clinton was elected to the Senate, she had strong political reasons to care about the mili tary. The Pentagon was in the midst of a long, politically charged process of closing military bases New York State had already been a victim, when Plattsburgh Air Force Base was closed in 1995, a loss of 352 civilian jobs for that   North Country town. New York’s delegation was determined to protect its remaining bases, especially Fort Drum, home of the Army’s 10th Mountain Division, which sprawls over a hundred thousand acres in rural Jefferson County. In October 2001, a month after the   terrorist attacks, Clinton traveled to Fort Drum at the invitation of Gen. Buster Hagenbeck, who had just been named the division’s commander and would be deployed to Afghanistan a month later. Like many of the officers I spoke with, he had preconceptions of Clinton from her years as first lady the woman who showed up at his office around happy hour that afternoon did not fulfill them. “She sat down,” he recalls, “took her shoes off, put her feet up on the coffee table and said, ‘General, do you know where a gal can get a cold beer around here? ’’u2009” It was the start of a dialogue that stretched over two wars. In the spring of 2002, Hagenbeck led Operation Anaconda, a   assault on Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the    Valley that was the largest combat engagement of the war to date. When the general came back to Washington to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Clinton took him out to dinner on Capitol Hill for her own briefing. They also spoke about the Bush administration’s preparations for war in Iraq, something which Hagenbeck was following anxiously. The general, it turned out, was more of a dove than the senator. He warned her about the risks of an invasion, which was then being   inside the Pentagon. It would be like “kicking over a bee’s nest,” he said. Hagenbeck excused Clinton’s vote in 2002 to authorize military action in Iraq. “She made a considered call,” he says. And “she was chagrined, much after the fact. ” For him, what mattered more than Clinton’s voting record was her unstinting public support of the military, whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first year in Afghanistan. Clinton’s education in military affairs began in earnest in 2002, after the Democratic Party’s crushing defeat in midterm elections moved her up several rungs in Senate seniority. The party’s congressional leaders offered her a seat on either the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the Senate Armed Services Committee. She chose Armed Services, spurning a long tradition of New York senators, like Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jacob Javits, who coveted the prestige of Foreign Relations. Armed Services deals with more earthbound issues, like benefits for veterans, and it had long been the preserve of Republican hawks like John McCain. But after   Clinton saw Armed Services as better preparation for her future. For a politician looking to hone   credentials  —   a woman who aspired to be commander in chief  —   it was the perfect training ground. She dug in like a grunt at boot camp. Andrew Shapiro, then Senator Clinton’s   adviser, called upon 10 experts  —   including Bill Perry, who was defense secretary under her husband, and Ashton Carter, who would eventually become President Obama’s fourth defense secretary  —   to tutor her on everything from grand strategy to defense procurement. She met quietly with Andrew Marshall, an octogenarian strategist at the Pentagon who labored for decades in the blandly named Office of Net Assessment, earning the nickname Yoda for his Delphic insights. She went to every committee meeting, no matter how mundane. Aides recall her on   sitting alone in the chamber, patiently questioning a lieutenant colonel. She visited the troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving Day in 2003 and spoke at every significant military installation in New York State. By then  —   30 years after she recalled being rejected by a Marine recruiter in Arkansas  —   Hillary Clinton had become a military wonk. Jack Keane is one of the intellectual architects of the Iraq surge he is also perhaps the greatest single influence on the way Hillary Clinton thinks about military issues. A bear of a man with a jowly, careworn face and   hair, Keane exudes the supreme   you would expect of a retired   general. He speaks with a trace of a New York accent that gives his pronouncements a    urgency. He is also a   member of the   complex, sitting on the board of General Dynamics and serving as a strategic adviser to Academi, the   contractor once known as Blackwater. And he is the chairman of an aptly named think tank, the Institute for the Study of War. Though he is one of a parade of   generals, Keane is the resident hawk on Fox News, where he appears regularly to call for the United States to use greater military force in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. He doesn’t shrink from putting boots on the ground and has little use for civilian leaders, like Obama, who do. Keane first got to know Clinton in the fall of 2001, when she was a freshman senator and he was the Army’s second in command, with a distinguished combat and command record in Vietnam, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. He had expected her to be intelligent,   and politically astute, but he was not prepared for the respect she showed for the Army as an institution, or her sympathy for the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families. Keane was confident he could smell a phony politician a mile away, and he didn’t get that whiff from her. “I read people that’s one of my strengths,” he told me. “It’s not that I can’t be fooled, but I’m not fooled often. ” Clinton took an instant liking to Keane, too. “She loves that Irish gruff thing,” says one of her Senate aides, Kris Balderston, who was in the room that day. When Keane got up after 45 minutes to leave for a meeting back at the Pentagon with a Polish general, she protested that she wasn’t finished yet and asked for another appointment. “I said, ‘O. K. but it took me three months to get this one,’’u2009” Keane told her dryly. Clinton exploded into a raucous laugh. “I’ll take care of that problem,” she promised. She was true to her word: The two would meet many times over the next decade, discussing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Iranian nu clear threat and other flash points in the Middle East. Sometimes he dropped by her Senate office other times they met for dinner or drinks. He escorted her on her first visit to Fort Drum and set up her first trip to Iraq. They generally agreed to forgo talk of politics, but at a meeting in Clinton’s Senate office in January 2007, Keane tried to sell her on the logic of a troop surge in Iraq. The previous month, he had met with President Bush in the Oval Office to recommend that the United States deploy five to eight Army and Marine brigades to wage an urban counterinsurgency campaign only that, he argued, would stabilize a country being ripped apart by sectarian strife. His presentation angered some of Keane’s fellow generals, who feared that such a strategy would deepen Iraq’s dependency and prolong America’s involvement. But it had a big impact on the commander in chief, who soon ordered more than 20, 000 additional troops to Iraq. Clinton was another story. “I’m convinced it’s not going to work, Jack,” she told him. She predicted that the American soldiers patrolling in Iraqi cities and towns would be “blown up” by Sunni militias or Al Qaeda fighters. “She thought we would fail,” Keane recalls, “and it was going to cause increased casualties. ” Politics, of course, was also on her mind. Barack Obama was laying the groundwork for his candidacy in   with a campaign that would emphasize his opposition to the Iraq War and her vote in favor of it  —   a vote that still shadows her in this year’s Democratic primaries. Obama was setting off on a   drive that would net $25 million in three months, sending tremors through Clinton’s political camp and establishing him as a formidable rival. Although she disagreed with Keane about Iraq, Clinton asked him to become a formal adviser. “As much as I respect you,” he replied, “I can’t do that. ” Keane’s wife had health problems that had moved up his retirement from the Army, and he did not, as a policy, endorse candidates. Sometime during 2008  —   he doesn’t remember exactly when  —   Clinton told him she had erred in doubting the wisdom of the surge. “She said, ‘You were right, this really did work,’’u2009” Keane recalls. “On issues of national security,” he says, “I thought she was always intellectually honest with me. ” He and Clinton continued to talk, even after Obama was elected and she became secretary of state. More often than not, they found themselves in sync. Keane, like Clinton, favored more robust intervention in Syria than Obama did. In April 2015, the week before she announced her candidacy, Clinton asked him for a briefing on military options for dealing with the fighters of the Islamic State. Bringing along three young female analysts from the Institute for the Study of War, Keane gave her a     presentation. Among other steps, he advocated imposing a   zone over parts of Syria that would neutralize the air power of the Syrian president, Bashar   with a goal of forcing him into a political settlement with opposition groups. Six months later, Clinton publicly adopted this position, further distancing herself from Obama. “I’m convinced this president, no matter what the circumstances, will never put any boots on the ground to do anything, even when it’s compelling,” Keane told me. He was sitting in the library at his home in McLean, Va. which is lined with books on military history and strategy. His critique of Obama was hardly new or original, but much of it mirrors the thinking of Clinton and her policy advisers. “One of the problems the president has, which weakens his diplomatic efforts, is that leaders don’t believe he would use military power. That’s an issue that would separate the president from Hillary Clinton rather dramatically. She would look at military force as another realistic option, but only where there is no other option. ” Befriending Keane wasn’t just about cultivating a single adviser. It gave Clinton instant entree to his informal network of   and retired generals. The most interesting by far was David Petraeus, a cerebral commander who shared Clinton’s   ambition and whose life stories would mix heady success with humbling setbacks. Both would be accused of mishandling classified information  —   Clinton because of her use of a private server and email address to conduct sensitive government business, a decision that erupted into a political scandal Petraeus because he had given a diary containing classified information to his biographer and mistress (he was eventually charged with a misdemeanor for mishandling classified information). On Clinton’s first trip to Iraq in November 2003, Petraeus, then a   general commanding the 101st Airborne Division, flew from his field headquarters in Mosul to the relative safety of Kirkuk to brief her congressional delegation. “She was full of questions,” he recalls. “It was the kind of gesture that means a lot to a battlefield commander. ” On subsequent trips, as he rose in rank, Petraeus walked her through his plans to train and equip Iraqi Army troops, a forerunner of the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It worked to their mutual benefit: Petraeus was building ties to a prominent Democratic voice in the Senate Clinton was burnishing her image as a friend of the troops. “She did it the   way,” he says. “She did it by pursuing relationships. ” When Petraeus was sent back to Iraq as the top commander in early 2007, he gave every member of the Senate Armed Services Committee a copy of the U. S.   Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, which he edited during a tour at Fort Leavenworth. Clinton read hers from cover to cover. Although Clinton’s reservations about the surge were valid  —   the stability that the additional troops brought to Iraq didn’t last  —   her opposition to it, like her vote for the war, came back to haunt her. This time, it was her ally Bob Gates who summoned the ghost. In his memoirs, Gates wrote that she confessed to him and the president that her position had been politically motivated, because she was then facing Obama in the Iowa caucuses. (Obama, he wrote, “vaguely” conceded that he, too, had opposed it for political reasons.) Clinton pushed back, telling Diane Sawyer of ABC News that Gates “perhaps either missed the context or the meaning, because I did oppose the surge. ” Her opposition, she told Sawyer, was driven by the fact that at that time, people were not going to accept any escalation of the war. “This is not politics in electoral, political terms,” Clinton said. “This is politics in the sense of the American public has to support commitments like this. ” The next time she found herself in a debate over sending troops into harm’s way, she voiced no such reservations. “We need maps,” Hillary Clinton told her aides. It was early October 2009, and she had just returned from a meeting in the Situation Room. Obama’s war cabinet was debating how many additional troops to send to Afghanistan, where the United States, preoccupied by Iraq, had allowed the Taliban to regroup. The Pentagon, she reported, had used impressive,   maps to show its plans to deploy troops around the country. The attention to detail made Gates and his commanders look crisp and well prepared the State Department, which was pushing a “civilian surge” to accompany the troops, looked wan by comparison. At the next meeting, on Oct. 14, the team from State unfurled its own maps to show the deployment of an army of aid workers, diplomats, legal experts and crop specialists who were supposed to follow the soldiers into Afghanistan. Clinton’s fixation with maps was typical of her   in the first great    debate of the Obama presidency. She wanted to be taken seriously, even if her department was less central than the Pentagon. One way to do that was by promoting the civilian surge, the pet project of her friend and special envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke. “She was determined that her briefing books would be just as thick and just as meticulous as those of the Pentagon,” a senior adviser recalls. She also didn’t hesitate to get into the Pentagon’s business, asking detailed questions about the training of Afghan troops and wading into the weeds of military planning. She resolved not to miss out on anything  —   a determination that may have been rooted in a deeper insecurity about her role in what was to become the most White   administration of the modern era. On the morning of June 8, 2009, she emailed two aides to say: “I heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go? If not, who are we sending?” On Feb. 10, 2010, she dialed the White House from her home, but couldn’t get past the switchboard operator, who didn’t believe she was really Hillary Clinton. Asked to provide her office number to prove her identity, she said she didn’t know it. Finally, Clinton hung up in frustration and placed the call again through the State Department Operations Center  —   “like a proper and properly dependent secretary of state,” as she later wrote to one aide in a   tone. “No independent dialing allowed. ” The Afghan troop debate, a   drama of dueling egos, leaked documents and endless deliberations, is typically framed as a test of wills between the Pentagon’s wily military commanders and an inexperienced young president, with Joe Biden playing the role of devil’s advocate for Obama. While that portrait is accurate, it neglects the role of Clinton. By siding with Gates and the generals, she gave political ballast to their proposals and provided a bullish counterpoint to Biden’s skepticism. Her role should not be overstated: She did not turn the debate, nor did she bring to it any distinctive point of view. But her unstinting support of General McChrystal’s maximalist recommendation made it harder for Obama to choose a lesser option. (McChrystal was later fired by Obama after his aides made derogatory remarks about almost every member of his war cabinet to Rolling Stone magazine she was the exception. “Hillary had Stan’s back,” one of his aides told the reporter, Michael Hastings.) “Hillary was adamant in her support for what Stan asked for,” Gates says. “She made clear that she was ready to support his request for the full 40, 000 troops. She then made clear that she was only willing to go with the 30, 000 number because I proposed it. She was, in a way, tougher on the numbers in the surge than I was. ” Gates believed that if he could align Clinton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen the commander of Central Command, David Petraeus and himself behind a common position, it would be hard for Obama to say no. “How could you ignore these Four Horsemen of national security?” says Geoff Morrell, who served as the Pentagon press secretary at the time. Just as Clinton benefited from her alliance with the military commanders, she gave them political cover. “Here’s the dirty little secret,” says Tom Nides, her former deputy secretary of state for management and resources. “They all knew they wanted her on their side. They knew that if they walked into the Situation Room and they had her, it made a huge difference in the dynamics. When she opened her mouth, she could change the momentum in the room. ” David Axelrod recalls one meeting where Clinton “kicked the thing off and pretty much articulated their opinion I’m sure that’s one that they remember. There’s no doubt that she wanted to give them every troop that McChrystal was asking for. ” Still, Clinton didn’t prevail on every argument. After agreeing to send the troops, Obama added a condition of his own: that the soldiers be deployed as quickly as possible and pulled out again, starting in the summer of 2011  —   a deadline that proved more fateful in the long run than a difference of 10, 000 troops. Clinton opposed setting a public deadline for withdrawal, arguing that it would tip America’s hand to the Taliban and encourage them to wait out the United States  —   which, in fact, was exactly what happened. In the final days of the debate, Clinton also found herself at odds with her own ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry. He, too, held different views than she did on the wisdom of a surge, which he put into writing. On Nov. 6, 2009, in a long cable addressed to Clinton  —   and later leaked to The New York Times  —   he made a trenchant, convincing case for why the McChrystal proposal, which she endorsed two weeks earlier in a meeting with Obama, would saddle the United States with “vastly increased costs and an indefinite,   military role in Afghanistan. ” Much of Eikenberry’s analysis proved prescient, particularly his warnings about the threadbare American partnership with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. It carried an extra sting because he was a retired   Army general who was the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007. Clinton, who had not asked for the cable, was furious, fearing it could upset a debate in which she and the Pentagon were about to prevail. What the cable made clear was the degree to which the Afghanistan debate was dominated by military considerations. While Clinton did raise the need to deal with Afghanistan’s neighbor, Pakistan, her reflexive support of Gates, Petraeus and McChrystal meant she was not a powerful voice for diplomatic alternatives. “She contributed to the overmilitarizing of the analysis of the problem,” says Sarah Chayes, who was an adviser to McChrystal and later to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen. In October 2015, the persistent violence in Afghanistan and the legacy of Karzai’s misrule forced Obama to reverse his plan to withdraw the last American soldiers by the end of his presi dency. A few thousand troops will stay there indefinitely. And for all of Clinton’s talk about a civilian surge, it never really materialized. For Clinton, the Afghanistan episode laid bare a vexed relationship between her and Eikenberry, one of the few generals with whom she didn’t hit it off. A   with graduate degrees from Harvard and Stanford, Eikenberry was brilliant but had a reputation among his colleagues for being imperious. Clinton had a similarly chilly relationship with Douglas Lute, another Army lieutenant general with a graduate degree from Harvard, who also fought with Holbrooke. “She likes the    —   McChrystal, Petraeus, Keane,” one of her aides observes. “Real military guys, not these retired   who go into civilian jobs. ” “There’s no doubt that Hillary Clinton’s more muscular brand of American foreign policy is better matched to 2016 than it was to 2008,” said Jake Sullivan, her top policy adviser at the State Department, who plays the same role in her campaign. It was De cem ber 2015, 53 days before the Iowa caucuses, and Sullivan was sitting down with me in Clinton’s sprawling Brooklyn headquarters to explain how she was shaping her message for a campaign suddenly dominated by concerns about national security. Clinton’s strategy, he said, was twofold: Explain to voters that she had a clear plan for confronting the threat posed by Islamic terrorism, and expose her Republican opponents as utterly lacking in experience or credibility on national security. There were good reasons for Clinton to let her inner hawk fly. After the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. Americans’ concern about a major attack on the nation spiked. A   poll taken after Paris showed that a majority, 53 percent, favored sending ground troops to Iraq or Syria, a remarkable shift from the   sentiment that prevailed during most of Obama’s presidency. The Republican candidates were reaching for apocalyptic metaphors to demonstrate their resolve. Ted Cruz threatened to   the Islamic State to test whether desert sand can glow Donald Trump called for the United States to ban all Muslims from entering the country “until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses. ” Yet such spikes in the public appetite for mili tary action tend to be transitory. Three weeks later, the same poll showed an even split, at 49 percent, on whether to deploy troops. Neither Trump nor Cruz favors major new deployments of American soldiers to Iraq and Syria (nor, for that matter, does Clinton). If anything, both are more skeptical than Clinton about intervention and more circumspect than she about maintaining the nation’s   War II military commitments. Trump loudly proclaims his opposition to the Iraq War. He wants the United States to spend less to underwrite NATO and has talked about withdrawing the American security umbrella from Asia, even if that means Japan and South Korea would acquire nuclear weapons to defend themselves. Cruz, unlike Clinton, opposed aiding the Syrian rebels in 2014. He once supported Pentagon budget constraints advocated by his isolationist colleague, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Thus might the gen eral election present voters with an unfamiliar choice: a Democratic hawk versus a Republican reluctant warrior. To thwart the progressive insurgency of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton carefully calibrated her message during the Democratic primaries to align herself closely with Barack Obama and his racially diverse coalition. But as she pivots to the general election, that balancing act with Obama will become trickier. “There’s going to be a huge amount of interest in the press to ” Sullivan says. “It just so easily can become a sport that distracts from her ability to make an affirmative case. ” In showing her stripes as a prospective commander in chief, Clinton will no doubt draw heavily upon her State Department experience  —   filtering the lessons she learned in Libya, Syria and Iraq into the sinewy worldview she has held since childhood. Last fall, in a series of policy speeches, Clinton began limning distinctions with the president on national security. She said the United States should consider sending more   troops to Iraq than Obama had committed, to help the Iraqis and Kurds fight the Islamic State. She came out in favor of a partial   zone over Syria. And she described the threat posed by ISIS to Americans in starker terms than he did. As is often the case with Clinton and Obama, the differences were less about direction than degree. She wasn’t calling for ground troops in the Middle East, any more than he was. Clinton insisted her plan was not a break with his, merely an “intensification and acceleration” of it. It’s an open question how well Clinton’s hawkish instincts match the country’s mood. Americans are weary of war and remain suspicious of foreign entanglements. And yet, after the retrenchment of the Obama years, there is polling evidence that they are equally dissatisfied with a portrait of their country as a spent force, managing its decline amid a world of rising powers like China, resurgent empires like Vladimir Putin’s Russia and lethal new forces like the Islamic State. If Obama’s minimalist approach was a necessary reaction to the maximalist style of his predecessor, then perhaps what Americans yearn for is something in between  —   the kind of   pragmatism that Clinton has spent a lifetime honing. “The president has made some tough decisions,” says Leon Panetta, who served as Obama’s defense secretary after Bob Gates, and as director of the C. I. A. before David Petraeus. “But it’s been a mixed record, and the concern is, the president defining what America’s role in the world is in the 21st century hasn’t happened. “Hopefully, he’ll do it,” he added, acknowledging the time Obama has left. “Certainly, she would. ”"
23137,"Your Wednesday Briefing: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, iPhone - The New York Times",New York Times,Adeel Hassan,M,2016-04-27,2016.0,4.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Electoral map shrinks for Sanders and Cruz. After Donald J. Trump’s sweep of five primaries in Eastern states on Tuesday, and Hillary Clinton’s victories in four of five, there are few chances for Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to catch up in the delegate count. Here are our takeaways and what the candidates said after the results. Both   are looking ahead to the general election. Mr. Trump is giving a speech on foreign policy in Washington today, while Mrs. Clinton is sharpening her pitch for November. • On Capitol Hill. The Senate is near a deal for at least $1. 1 billion to fight the Zika virus, but the measure faces resistance from House Republicans. Despite lawmakers’ bickering, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, can point to some legislative victories, complete with Democratic support. • Sentencing for former House speaker. J. Dennis Hastert, 74, the   Republican House speaker in history, is expected to be sentenced today in federal court, after pleading guilty last year to a banking violation tied to accusations of sexual abuse. One of his accusers is suing him for $1. 8 million, the money he had been promised as compensation for the abuse. • Taking their lumps. Apple posted its first quarterly decline in revenue in 13 years, hurt by a drop in iPhone sales in China, the company’s most important market after the U. S. The restaurant chain Chipotle had its first quarterly loss as a public company, and Exxon Mobil was stripped of its top credit rating for the first time since the Great Depression. • At the Supreme Court. The justices will consider an appeal today from Bob McDonnell, the former Virginia governor who was convicted of public corruption for trading political favors for gifts and loans. The case could produce a major ruling placing limits on bribery laws. In a    decision on Tuesday, they said it was unconstitutional to demote a police officer based on the mistaken assumption that he had engaged in political activity. • Iraq in turmoil. Iraq’s Parliament has begun voting on a cabinet after protesters demanded government reforms and leaders untainted by corruption or sectarian connections. The political stalemate and the drop in prices of oil, the country’s main source of revenue, aren’t helping the effort to defeat Islamic State militants. • Police playbook gains a chapter. Police departments around the U. S. are turning to crisis intervention training in response to   shootings of people with mental illnesses.   percent or more of people fatally shot by the police have had a mental disorder. Separately, John R. Kasich often speaks about mental health on the campaign trail, and as his brother, Rick, has struggled with bipolar disorder. Rick Kasich gave us his first extended interview. •  A Volkswagen executive’s 2006 PowerPoint presentation laid out a strategy for rigging pollution tests. • Comcast is in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation, the boutique studio run by Jeffrey Katzenberg. • The founder of Chobani, a yogurt maker, surprised his 2, 000   employees with shares worth up to 10 percent of the company. • Here are snapshots of the U. S. and global markets. • Prince left no will, sister says. In newly filed court documents, the musician’s sister says that he died without a spouse, children or surviving parents, and that he had no will. That will surely complicate his financial estate and musical legacy, which includes a trove of unreleased songs. • Gaining new insights. Runners now have an exact schedule that will predict how their performance will decline as they age. Police officers are using artworks in museums to sharpen their ability to notice details. • Scoreboard. The Toronto Raptors and Atlanta Hawks are each one win away from advancing in the N. B. A. playoffs after their victories on Tuesday night. There were no N. H. L. games, which meant hockey players could work on having a good night’s sleep. • U. S. math scores decline. The average performance of the nation’s high school seniors dropped in math from 2013 to 2015, but it held steady in reading, according to results of a test released today. • Recipes of the day. Make a big batch of   oatmeal and you’ll have breakfast for days. Radish sandwiches are great for lunch or   hors d’oeuvres. Or try this classic tuna sandwich. While some Americans may snicker at snooker, it’s one of Britain’s most popular games, with millions who play and who watch live coverage on the BBC, and it’s growing in countries like China. The annual World Snooker Championship continues this week in Sheffield, England. The   winner Ronnie O’Sullivan was eliminated on Tuesday. Like cricket, another British creation, it has complicated rules. Snooker uses a larger table, and narrower pockets than the older game of billiards. It’s played with 15 red balls, a white cue ball and six balls of other colors. In short, once all 15 red balls have been pocketed, the colored balls  —   each worth a different number of points  —   must be sunk in a specific order. A “snooker” occurs when a player’s cue ball gets boxed in and can’t make contact with the ball he is next supposed to sink without fouling. The game was invented in 1875 by a British military officer stationed in India named Neville Chamberlain (no, not that Neville Chamberlain). At the time, the word snooker was a derisive term for a new cadet. The game is believed to have adopted the name because of the cadets’ susceptibility to crafty play.

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton hope to win the Indiana presidential primaries on Tuesday, all but cementing their nominations. Trade experts warn that Mr. Trump’s ideas on international commerce, like imposing heavy tariffs on China, could prompt retaliation and deepen U. S. economic troubles. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton raised $26. 4 million in April, giving her $30 million in hand and bringing her total in primary funds to $213. 5 million, compared with $210 million for Bernie Sanders. She made a longtime Clinton insider, Minyon Moore, a senior adviser in her campaign. Above, Mrs. Clinton with steelworkers in Kentucky. After Indiana, the next heavyweight primary is California’s on June 7. _____ 3. This Australian computer programmer, Craig Steven Wright, claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the online currency Bitcoin. But many technical experts say he offered insufficient proof. “It would take the real Satoshi about five minutes to provide conclusive proof to the entire Bitcoin community, if the real Satoshi wanted to do that,” one said. The price of Bitcoin fell about $10, to just over $445. _____ 4. Fair warning for air travelers: Do not cut it close for your next flight. A loss of screeners to budget cuts, new procedures and more passengers are creating epic security lines across the U. S.  —   even before the peak travel season. “This is going to be a rough summer,” an official with the Transportation Security Administration said. _____ 5. The party of the year. The Oscars of the East Coast. An A. T. M. for the Met. Whatever you call it, the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted its annual Costume Institute gala under the eye of Anna Wintour. Tickets this year were $30, 000 apiece, and Ms. Wintour has final say over every invitation and attendee. Here are photos from the red carpet. _____ 6. A teacher sickout closed nearly all Detroit’s public schools, affecting almost 46, 000 children. The   school district said that if the state did not kick in more money, summer school would be canceled and teachers would not be paid for July and August. _____ 7. Protests and threats of violence against abortion providers have pushed some to try to keep their work quiet. But one gynecologist accuses her hospital in Washington, D. C. of going too far. Dr. Diane   filed a federal civil rights complaint saying the institution had violated the law and personal rights by forbidding her to speak publicly about abortion _____ 8. The Hulu streaming service is working toward offering a “skinny bundle” of broadcast and cable channels, probably for about $40 a month, according to insiders. The service would cater to the individualized expectations of younger viewers, while allowing advertisers to target particular audiences. U. S. stocks rose, recovering from some of last week’s steep declines. Battered technology stocks like Amazon and Microsoft posted gains, but Apple remained down. _____ 9. “The Biggest Loser” has become part of the science of dieting. Researchers tracked competitors as they regained most or all of the weight they lost, and discovered how hard the body fights to undo weight loss. Two key factors: slowed metabolic rates, and hormonal changes that create incessant hunger. “It is frightening and amazing,” an obesity expert said. _____ 10. Negotiations are underway to bring a   back into effect in the Syrian city of Aleppo. “The cessation of hostilities has been put to the test, and it has frayed in certain areas, and it has fallen completely in a few areas,” Secretary of State John Kerry said in Geneva. _____ 11.

The suit, challenging rules of the Affordable Care Act, was sent back to lower courts for a compromise. Religious groups will buy insurance plans for their workers that do not cover contraception, and employees will be able to obtain that coverage from the same insurer. _____ 2. Doctors said this Massachusetts man was recovering well after undergoing the first penis transplant in the U. S. Thomas Manning, whose penis was amputated several years ago to remove a rare cancer, said he hoped his case would help reassure other men with genital injuries, especially veterans. “Don’t hide behind a rock,” he said. _____ 3. Donald Trump outlined his strategy against Hillary Clinton. “Just getting nasty” won’t work, he said, and could cost him women’s votes. Instead, he told our political reporters, he will portray her as enabling Bill Clinton’s infidelities, hold her responsible for the Benghazi attacks and challenge her as fundamentally corrupt. He’s also urging Bernie Sanders to consider running as a   candidate. _____ 4. Oregon’s primaries and Kentucky’s Democratic one are on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton has been campaigning in Kentucky for the last couple of days, stressing her plans to revitalize the economy and her support for the coal industry.

A group of big unions pledged to boycott the Democrats’ ambitious     operation unless they cut ties with Thomas Steyer, a   manager who has spent millions to fight climate change. _____ 5. Dogs are at the forefront of a new approach to improve human health. Researchers are testing rapamycin, a drug that appears to delay the onset of aging in mice, to see if it has any canine side effects, before undertaking human tests. (The dogs’ owners are thrilled at the possibility of lengthening their pets’ lives.) The overall goal is to target the biology that underlies human aging, which is the greatest risk factor for the biggest killers in the developed world: heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, diabetes and cancer. _____ 6. Venezuela’s economic crisis, set off by collapsing oil prices, has metastasized into a health crisis. Hospitals and clinics have little medicine, and even less in the way of sterile equipment. Some lack even sufficient water to wash blood from surgical tables. Deaths among new mothers in government hospitals have multiplied, and deaths of their newborns have skyrocketed more than a hundredfold. _____ 7. “The students brought elderly people into the school and beat them.

23213,Donald Trump Tells N.R.A. Hillary Clinton Wants to Let Violent Criminals Go Free - The New York Times,New York Times,Ashley Parker,F,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,,"LOUISVILLE, Ky.  —   Donald J. Trump accused Hillary Clinton on Friday of wanting to let violent criminals out of prison and “disarm”   citizens in unsafe neighborhoods, and warned that women, in particular, would be at greater risk if she were elected president. Accepting the endorsement of the National Rifle Association at its annual convention here, Mr. Trump  —   who has not always been the staunchest opponent of stricter gun controls  —   said the November election would be a referendum on the Second Amendment. He claimed,  hyperbolically, that Mrs. Clinton, his likely Democratic opponent, “wants to take away your guns. ” “Crooked Hillary Clinton is the most     Amendment candidate ever to run for office,” he said. Mrs. Clinton has called for tightened restrictions on guns, but not for abolishing the right to own them. Mr. Trump, whose record of sexist remarks, among other things, has left him at a potentially crippling disadvantage among female voters, polls show, appealed directly to women in his speech, imbuing his defense of gun rights with an undercurrent of fear. “In trying to overturn the Second Amendment, Hillary Clinton is telling everyone  —   and every woman living in a dangerous community  —   that she doesn’t have the right to defend herself,” Mr. Trump said. “So you have a woman living in a community, a rough community, a bad community  —   sorry, you can’t defend yourself. ” If Mr. Trump’s comments seemed reminiscent of an era when crime rates were far higher  —   the Willie Horton ads attacking Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, in the 1988 presidential race came to mind  —   they also appeared somewhat at odds with the broad bipartisan consensus on the need to reduce incarceration rates and prison populations: Mr. Trump sought to frighten voters about the idea of criminals being released from prison. He said Mrs. Clinton’s agenda was “to release the violent criminals from jail,” freeing them to roam the streets and put “innocent Americans at risk. ” He even tried out a new epithet for Mrs. Clinton: “heartless Hillary. ” Calling Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “heartless hypocrites,” he dared them to “let their bodyguards immediately disarm,” an apparent reference to their Secret Service protection. “Let’s see how good they do,” Mr. Trump said. “Let’s see how they feel walking around without their guns and their bodyguards. In the meantime, nobody else can have the guns, right?” Mr. Trump’s efforts to shore up his support among the N. R. A. ’s more than five million members could help him in the Rust Belt states that he would need to carry to win the White House. But Mrs. Clinton must strike a more delicate balance on the issue: In the Democratic primaries against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a mixed record on gun control, she has taken an aggressive tack against firearm manufacturers and sellers. In a general election contest with Mr. Trump, however, Mrs. Clinton would vie with him for the loyalties of white voters in a number of battleground states where support for gun rights runs deep. Indeed, in recent weeks, as she campaigned before largely white,   audiences in Appalachian and Great Lakes states, she has   gun control and focused more on job creation and economic aid for financially struggling communities. But on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton will speak at a dinner of the Trayvon Martin Foundation’s “Circle of Mothers” in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. a group offering support to women who have lost a child to gun violence. And she is expected to press the issue to win over voters in Los Angeles, Oakland and other California cities before that state’s primary on June 7. Maya Harris, a senior policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, dismissed Mr. Trump’s attacks on Friday, saying he was “peddling falsehoods. ” “Along with the vast majority of Americans, Hillary Clinton believes there are   steps we can take at the federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while respecting the Second Amendment,” Ms. Harris said. Since announcing his presidential bid, Mr. Trump  —   who himself has a concealed carry permit and whose two oldest sons are avid hunters  —   has fashioned himself a fierce advocate of gun rights. He has released a policy paper on the Second Amendment, has called for making concealed carry permits valid in all 50 states and routinely tells his audiences, as he did again here on Friday, that terrorist attacks like those last year in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. might have been prevented if more people were armed. But his support for gun rights has not always been so absolutist. In his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” he wrote that he “generally” opposed gun control, but criticized the N. R. A. ’s outsize lobbying power, saying, “I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. ” After President Obama spoke in 2012 at a vigil for those killed in the school shootings in Newtown, Conn. Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: “President Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks in #Newtown, Connecticut. ” On Friday, however, Mr. Trump took his support for gun rights an additional step. In January, he said he wanted to end   zones in schools. In his speech here, he said he wanted to do away with them entirely. “We’re getting rid of   zones,” he said, arguing that more guns would mean less gun violence, as his audience cheered. Officially throwing the N. R. A. ’s support to Mr. Trump, Chris W. Cox, executive director of the group’s political and lobbying arm, warned that Mrs. Clinton would appoint liberal justices to the Supreme Court who would roll back gun rights. “We have to unite and we have to unite right now,” Mr. Cox said. (He also played a clip of Mrs. Clinton talking about the Second Amendment, but not before “accidentally” playing a video showing Mrs. Clinton barking like a dog.) The Secret Service prevented attendees from bringing knives and guns  —   ordinarily commonplace accessories at the convention  —   into the hall where Mr. Trump was speaking, prompting some grumbling. There was also some grumbling about the presidential campaign, despite the N. R. A. ’s endorsement. Dan Kelsey, 57, an I. T. consultant and N. R. A. member from Columbus, Ohio, said he was not excited about Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, and was worried that Mr. Trump might shift his position on the Second Amendment. “He talks a good game, but I’m not sure what his core values are,” Mr. Kelsey said. “He’s a good entertainer and marketer, but I don’t know what he really believes. ” Yet to other members of the group, Mr. Trump’s promises to support the Second Amendment were reassurance enough. Dianne Jennings, 67, a certified N. R. A. pistol instructor from Dayton, Ohio, said she had “nothing nice to say” about Mrs. Clinton: “Basically, I detest her. ” Ms. Jennings said that she found Mr. Trump “entertaining” and “not politically correct” and that she thought he would do a good job as president. “I think people are just terrified of his persona, but I think he has a lot of different personas,” she said, “and he can use the right one in the right situation. ”"
23218,"Citing Family, Hillary Clinton Affirms Gun-Control Stance - The New York Times",New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-06-14,2016.0,6.0,,"Hillary Clinton invoked her roles as mother and grandmother on Saturday to deliver an impassioned rebuttal to Donald J. Trump’s contention that her push for stricter gun control would make families less safe, saying the presumptive Republican nominee would put more children “at risk of violence and bigotry. ” The day after Mr. Trump received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, Mrs. Clinton assailed her probable general election rival as pandering to the group. “I believe it’s the most powerful lobby in Washington,” Mrs. Clinton said of the N. R. A. at an event in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. to benefit the Trayvon Martin Foundation’s Circle of Mothers. “And we know some candidates will say or do anything to make them happy. ” Speaking in a ballroom full of mothers who had lost children to gun violence, Mrs. Clinton defended her position on gun control and her promise to overhaul the criminal justice system. “I love my daughter and granddaughter more than anything, and I worry about them as every mother does, and I want them always to be safe,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Parents, teachers and schools should have the right to keep guns out of classrooms, just like Donald Trump does at many of his hotels by the way. ” She mentioned his speech to the N. R. A. on Friday, which included a vow to allow teachers and principals to arm themselves. “This is someone running to be president of the United States, a country facing a gun violence epidemic, and he’s talking about more guns in our schools,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He’s talking about more hatred and violence in our streets. ” Mrs. Clinton delivered her remarks to a group named after Mr. Martin, an unarmed black    who was fatally shot in 2012 by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman. Before she spoke, Mrs. Clinton sat for dinner alongside Mr. Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton. “We will carry the memories of your sons and daughters in our hearts every day, as you do,” Mrs. Clinton told the group as she affirmed her plans to strengthen background checks and take other measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Mr. Trump, speaking before N. R. A. members in Louisville, Ky. called Mrs. Clinton “the most     Amendment candidate ever to run for office. ” Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton’s policies would put women in particular danger. “You have a woman living in a community, a rough community, a bad community  —   sorry, you can’t defend yourself,” he told the group on Friday. For months, Mrs. Clinton has made gun control a major issue in her Democratic primary campaign against Bernie Sanders, whose record as a senator from Vermont has been mixed on the issue. She has campaigned alongside the mothers of Eric Garner, Jordan Davis, Sandra Bland and others who have lost children in clashes with the police or to gun violence. Some of them attended the event on Saturday. The Clinton campaign has featured these mothers and Erica Smegielski, daughter of the school principal killed in the massacre in Sandy Hook, Conn. in evocative television ads. But as the Clinton campaign turns its focus to the fall election against Mr. Trump and as both candidates vie for the support of white voters in the Rust Belt, gun control has become less of a driving force. A New York   News poll in January found that 57 percent of respondents wanted stricter laws governing gun sales, and 88 percent favored background checks for all purchases. On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton reaffirmed her commitment to both gun control and the overhaul of the criminal justice system, two issues that formed the pillars of her primary campaign and have helped her win broad support among  . Mrs. Clinton vowed to end the “schools to prison pipeline” that affects black men. “Something is wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn’t consider their children as precious and worthy of protection as other children because of the color of their skins,” she said. Mrs. Clinton also restated her promise to “end the era of mass incarceration” and to “rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and communities”  —   issues that could resonate with voters in Los Angeles, Oakland and other California cities ahead of that state’s June 7 primary."

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Donald Trump railed at reporters for   his promises and revealing delays in donations he promised military veterans in January. “The press should be ashamed of themselves,” he said. “You make me look very bad. ” He also defended Trump University against testimony that was revealed as part of a lawsuit filed by dissatisfied former students. “I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme,” said one sales manager at the school. _____ 2. The battle for California heated up a week ahead of the primary. Gov. Jerry Brown endorsed Hillary Clinton, but also spoke highly of Bernie Sanders. “He has driven home the message that the top 1 percent has unfairly captured way too much of America’s wealth, leaving the majority of people far behind,” Mr. Brown said in an open letter. Above, Mr. Sanders campaigned in Northern California. _____ 3. The sniffer dogs U. S. airports rely on to detect even the most minute trace of explosives  face new challenges as bombmakers shift to using household chemicals, like the compound TATP. “So we’re now asking dogs not just to find a needle in a haystack,” one expert said. “Now we’re also saying to the dog, ‘We need you to find any sharp object in the haystack.’ ” _____ 4. “It is practically a reinvented game these   Splash Brothers are playing. ” That’s our sports columnist, saluting Stephen Curry, above, and Klay Thompson for pushing the Golden State Warriors into the N. B. A. finals with 13   on Monday night. (Game 1 of the title rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers: Thursday, 9 p. m. Eastern, at Golden State, ABC) _____ 5. The    party that took power in Poland in November is reviving efforts to extradite the filmmaker Roman Polanski to the U. S. the country’s close ally. The justice minister said he would appeal a court ruling that said turning over Mr. Polanski, 82, would be an “obviously unlawful” deprivation of liberty. He fled the U. S. decades ago, after pleading guilty to having sex with an underage girl. _____ 6.   militias, elite Iraqi Army counterterrorism forces and Sunni policemen are all taking part in the operation to drive Islamic State fighters out of the   city of Falluja. An estimated 50, 000 civilians are believed trapped with little food or medicine. _____ 7. The Cincinnati police said they were investigating how a    managed to get into a gorilla enclosure at the city’s zoo over the weekend. Zoo workers fatally shot the    gorilla after it dragged the boy around the pen, prompting complaints by animal rights activists and petitions blaming the boy’s mother. The police declined to identify the family. _____ 8. Our   story for days: a novelist’s essay on marriage. The bad news: Because we’re lonely, or mix love up with destructive tendencies, or think we can make happiness permanent, many of us marry the wrong people, he writes. The good: There really isn’t a perfect person to meet all of our needs anyway, so learn to tolerate differences. “Compatibility,” he concludes, “is an achievement of love it must not be its precondition. ” _____ 9. Federal data show that the number of homeless people over 50 has risen by about 20 percent since 2007, passing 300, 000 to make up some 31 percent of the nation’s total. Some people have been on the streets for a generation. “Skid Row is sad,” said a    homeless woman. “It is as sad as you can imagine. You literally have to live here to see how sad it is. ” _____ 10. Finally, can civil tensions be worked out in street theater? The spectacular Patum festival that wrapped up in Catalonia, Spain, dates to medieval times, but its evocation of the struggle between good and evil colorfully reflects the clashes between between right and left, church and state, the Spanish government in Madrid and Catalan secessionists. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Obama returned to Elkhart, Ind. the first city he visited after taking office, to celebrate it as a showcase for his economic policies’ success. He took his most forceful stance yet on the presidential election, accusing Republicans of aiming to help the rich at the expense of the struggling middle class. He did not mention Donald Trump by name, but railed against his pledge to roll back rules on Wall Street. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton also attacked Mr. Trump. She cited testimony from former employees portraying Trump University as unscrupulous and predatory and called him “a fraud. ” Above, a rally in New Jersey. On Thursday, she plans to use a speech in San Diego to lay out the damage a Trump presidency could do to national security. Meanwhile, the list of prominent Republicans who say they will not attend the Republican National Convention keeps growing. _____ 3. A French naval vessel picked up a signal believed to be from a data recorder belonging to EgyptAir Flight 804, the jet that crashed into the Mediterranean on May 19. Officials said it could take days to locate the source precisely, and then more time for underwater robots and sonar equipment to hunt for wreckage. _____ 4. Switzerland opened a   rail tunnel  —   the world’s longest and deepest  —   clearing the way for a   rail link under the Alps. The E. U.’s transportation minister called the Gotthard Base Tunnel “a milestone in European rail history. ” The new route should cut an hour off the   trip between the economic hubs of Zurich and Milan. _____ 5. It’s been nine years since the seventh and last “Harry Potter” book came out. One of our   stories today looks at how J. K. Rowling has kept her creative hand in   like outing Dumbledore as gay a few years ago. And her “official” eighth installment is nigh. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” a play in which the boy wizard is all grown up, begins previews in London next week. _____ 6. A huge wildfire is still ripping through western Canada. But the flames are out in the city of Fort McMurray, a hub of the   industry. Thousands of residents are being allowed back, if only to document damage for insurance claims. Crews are spraying sealant over toxic ash and rubble, and the government is working on a rail plan to remove masses of refrigerators and freezers ruined by spoiled food. _____ 7. Uber, Silicon Valley’s most valuable private business, has collected billions from investors over the last three years as it seeks to build a global empire. Now, Saudi Arabia is in, too, with $3. 5 billion, Uber’s biggest single infusion. The Saudis are seeking to expand their economy beyond oil. _____ 8. A strange, gruesome murder in Plano, Tex. played out partly on social media. This man told the police that he’d made a suicide pact with his girlfriend but that she’d “chickened out,” so he stabbed her to death. He also posted photos of each of them after the fact. He has been charged with murder, and Facebook has been criticized for leaving the photos up for 36 hours. _____ 9. The Syrian government eased limits on aid convoys, allowing the first trucks with food and medicine to reach the besieged   town of Daraya, on the outskirts of Damascus. Aid groups said the government was simply trying to stop the U. N. from turning to airdrops. Some critics have accused the government of trying to starve its opponents. _____ 10. Finally, many Americans worried about high blood pressure try to limit their salt intake, but the table shaker isn’t the problem. Processed and prepared foods tend to send sodium levels off the charts. The F. D. A. released voluntary guidelines for food manufacturers and restaurants urging gradual reductions. Public health advocates say the standards could eventually help avert thousands of heart attacks and strokes. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

23255,Hillary Clinton’s New Attack on Donald Trump Cheers Her Allies and Worries His - The New York Times,New York Times,"Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman and Amy Chozick",B,2016-06-21,2016.0,6.0,,"Hillary Clinton’s blistering new assault on Donald J. Trump has mollified many Democrats alarmed about the    presidential race  —   while inflaming Republican fears that Mr. Trump’s improvisational style and skeletal campaign will prove inadequate in repelling the type of attack Mrs. Clinton unleashed on Thursday. Mixing stark warnings that Mr. Trump would imperil America’s security with caustic personal critiques  —   “I’ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants”  —   Mrs. Clinton offered the first indication that she was willing to confront her unconventional opponent in the fashion many in her party believe his candidacy demands. “I thought it was one of the most important speeches Secretary Clinton has made throughout this campaign because it drew a line that for most of this campaign has not been drawn,” said Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary, arguing that Mr. Trump had “gotten away with murder” with his incendiary proposals and statements. Mrs. Clinton’s speech in San Diego drove home that “this is not just the fun and games of a primary, but a choice for the American people about who is going to sit in the Oval Office,” Mr. Panetta said. Democrats across the country expressed relief on Friday that Mrs. Clinton had finally delivered a comprehensive indictment of Mr. Trump’s fitness for the presidency. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said there had been “widespread concern” among Senate Democrats that Mrs. Clinton was not drawing sharp enough contrasts with Mr. Trump. “This speech really did that,” he said. Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who was attending the Detroit Chamber of Commerce’s annual retreat on Mackinac Island with many of the state’s most influential leaders, said, “The people up here who were worried about her said she is finally finding her groove. ” For several weeks, Mrs. Clinton had tried out a version of the campaign President Obama ran against Mitt Romney in 2012, portraying Mr. Trump as a heartless corporate titan who profited off the housing crisis and avoided paying taxes. But she was receiving scant news media coverage, and Mrs. Clinton’s advisers worried that voters were not as moved by   attacks against someone who unapologetically boasts about his wealth. After weeks in which Mr. Trump viciously attacked Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, over Mr. Clinton’s indiscretions, moreover, it had become clear that she needed a circuit breaker in the form of a more robust counterassault  —   and one that she could deliver herself, rather than relying on surrogates to deal the most forceful blows to Mr. Trump on her behalf. Her campaign’s decision was to seek to disqualify Mr. Trump on terrain that is Mrs. Clinton’s comfort zone: foreign policy. But billing her San Diego speech on Thursday as a foreign policy address was also something of a ruse: It turned out to be an acidly funny takedown of Mr. Trump and his temperament, giving him the same sort of belittling treatment he had used on his opponents to great effect. “There’s no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf course deal,” Mrs. Clinton said at one point. But as satisfying as her new line of attack was to many Democrats, as Mr. Panetta said, “The real question is going to be, ‘Where does it go from here? ’” Indeed, Mrs. Clinton returned to a familiar stump speech later on Thursday in El Centro, Calif. though on a stop to a campaign office in San Diego, she joked about her new offensive. “I was listing all the reasons why Donald Trump should never get near the White House,” she told volunteers, adding, “And even I was getting nervous. ” If Mrs. Clinton is able to overcome that nervousness and drive a sustained attack echoing her San Diego speech, some Democrats said she could negatively define Mr. Trump this summer the same way that Mr. Clinton managed to define Bob Dole in their 1996 presidential race. “What she did sets the parameters about what this election is about,” said Joe Lockhart, who was Mr. Clinton’s campaign press secretary that year. “It is very hard to change that in the    fight after Labor Day. ” That prospect, in turn, has Republicans deeply concerned about Mr. Trump. Despite being the party’s presumptive nominee for a month, Mr. Trump has yet to adapt his campaign to the demands of a general election. His only “war room” so far is his Twitter feed. He is campaigning in California, insisting that he can win one of the country’s most liberal states. He has spent a week attacking a Hispanic federal judge who is handling a lawsuit against him in increasingly racial terms, only drawing more attention to the case. And he continues to divide his attention: He will travel to Scotland and Ireland this month for a business event. Nor have Mr. Trump’s tactical choices inspired confidence. At a rally on Thursday night in San Jose, Calif. his main rejoinder to Mrs. Clinton’s speech was that she ought to be in jail over her use of a private email account as secretary of state. There was no broader counterattack from his campaign or his allies, a remarkable silence after Mrs. Clinton’s harshest critique yet. “He needs to get the Republican chorus singing for him, and making sure he’s got a lot of voices out there,” said Terry Nelson, a longtime Republican strategist. “He’s got to make sure he is reaching out to the party and letting them know what the message is, what to say and how to say it. ” There is little evidence of any such coordination. His campaign sent out no response to the Clinton speech. The Republican National Committee, on which Mr. Trump’s team has been leaning heavily, issued just one   critique of Mrs. Clinton’s foreign policy before her remarks. His campaign is also badly lagging behind the Democrats at   and there are signs this has affected spending: After a group supporting Mrs. Clinton ran ads last month against Mr. Trump, the Trump team asked about rates for television ads of its own, according to two media buyers apprised of those inquiries, but never followed up. Reached by phone, Mr. Trump addressed such concerns by saying he had proved he could rewrite political playbooks. “I think I’m defining her,” he said of Mrs. Clinton. “I think she’s being defined as a weak and ineffective person. ” Mr. Trump has four top aides who worked on Mr. Dole’s 1996 campaign. But his campaign’s problems already resemble some that plagued Mr. Dole, including a formidable opponent mounting an early offensive, and an undisciplined candidate. Mr. Dole said on Friday that Mr. Trump, whom he has endorsed, had mastered   and commanding media attention like no other recent nominee. But he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s speech signaled a need for Mr. Trump to adjust. “I think Hillary tried laying a groundwork, and I think that’s going to be sort of her template,” Mr. Dole said in an interview. “He has criticism of Hillary, but it’s sort of been scattered. ” Mr. Trump, he added, “has got to catch up. ”"

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton criticized Donald Trump for his derogatory comments on women and minorities in her first major speech as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The venue, a Planned Parenthood event, underscored her current focus on rallying the Democratic base rather than appealing to the center. She followed up on two big endorsements, meeting with Senator Elizabeth Warren and having aides begin setting up President Obama’s campaign appearances. _____ 2. Mr. Trump lashed back at Mrs. Clinton and sought to rally evangelical Christians, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “Road to Majority” conference. Protesters disrupted the proceedings. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, offered an unexpectedly blunt view of Mr. Trump’s failings and left open the possibility of rescinding his endorsement. _____ 3. Gawker Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put itself up for sale. The company faces a $140 million legal judgment from an    lawsuit brought by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan, with the financial backing of the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Gawker still plans to appeal. Above, its founder, Nick Denton, after the initial verdict. _____ 4. Thousands of people turned out in Louisville, Ky. for a joyous celebration of the life of Muhammad Ali, the boxing legend and civil rights icon honored around the world. Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal, Bryant Gumbel and Ali’s wife, Lonnie, eulogized him. People in the street chanted “Ali” and threw flowers at his funeral cortege, slapping hands with members of the Ali family and the actor Will Smith. “He dared to love black people at a time when black people had a problem loving themselves,” a minister said. _____ 5. Hockey fans also lost an icon. Gordie Howe, the Detroit Red Wings player who loved the sport so much that he was a grandfather by the time he retired, died Friday at the age of 88. The consummate tough guy, he was beloved in Detroit, where he spent most of his 32 professional seasons. Scotty Bowman, one of hockey’s most successful coaches, once said, “In my estimation, he was the best ever. ” _____ 6. Three officers who served in New York City’s Correction Department were the latest to be convicted in the brutal beating of an inmate, a case that brought to light the pervasive culture of violence on Rikers Island. The district attorney said the convictions “send a clear message that a uniform and a badge do not absolve anyone from committing a crime, and that even an inmate deserves to be treated like a human being. ” _____ 7. Malia Obama graduated from the prestigious Sidwell Friends high school in Washington. But social media appeared to pay more attention to two graduates in Texas, one of them above. The young women were met with support and outrage for declaring themselves to be undocumented immigrants as they left their Texas high schools. One is going to Yale, the other the University of Texas at Austin. _____ 8. The N. B. A. ushered in a hectic sports weekend, with the Golden State Warriors beating the Cleveland Cavaliers,   to take a   lead in the finals. The L. P. G. A. championship continues in Washington State, where Brooke Henderson held the lead after the first round (NBC and the Golf Channel, check listings for times). And Exaggerator, the Preakness winner, is the early favorite in the Belmont Stakes (post time 6:32 p. m. Eastern,  . com). _____ 9. Finally, Noah’s ark suffered a modern calamity. This replica, built by a Dutch carpenter using the biblical description as a blueprint, crashed into a Norwegian Coast Guard patrol in Oslo when the crew towing the wooden vessel lost control. “It is unclear what happened to the 8. 7 million x 2 animals on board,” a city resident tweeted.

23316,"Orlando, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump: Your Monday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",New York Times,Andrea Kannapell and Andrew Hinderaker,B,2016-06-13,2016.0,6.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Waves of grief, shock and anger spread through the country after the deadliest mass shooting in U. S. history. Most of the 49 people killed at a gay club in Orlando early Sunday were in their 20s and 30s. Anguish over the carnage exposed some of the nation’s deepest fault lines: gay vulnerabilities, fear of immigrants and Muslims, gun control, and the limits of domestic security. _____ 2. The gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, claimed allegiance to the Islamic State over the phone with negotiators before being killed in a gunfight. A survivor told of cowering for hours in a bathroom stall  —   and hearing two people hiding in the next one being shot dead. Investigators pored over the gunman’s history: born in New York to Afghan immigrants, abusive to his former wife, once claiming a connection to Al Qaeda, two pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia. _____ 3. After a briefing, President Obama said the gunman appeared to be a homegrown extremist. He also urged Americans to reconsider gun laws that “make it very easy for individuals who are troubled, or disturbed, or want to engage in violent acts to obtain very powerful weapons very easily, and it’s a problem. ” 4. The attack loomed over the presidential race. Donald Trump seized on the attack to criticize the president, calling him a “fool. ” Mr. Trump continued to question the loyalties of Muslims in the U. S. saying that they should turn in terrorists in their midst and warning that “thousands of people already in our country are sick with hate. ” Hillary Clinton called for resolve and political unity, saying that “lone wolves” could be hunted down and that “weapons of war” should removed from the streets. _____ 5. In Orlando, people lined up by the hundreds to donate blood for the victims. “I’ve been here 13 years and never seen a response like this,” a blood center official said. _____ 6. Flags flew at   at U. S. embassies and in the capital, and messages of condolence flooded in from around the world. Tim Cook, the C. E. O. of Apple, led a moment of silence at the company’s annual developers conference. (That overshadowed the news there: App developers will be able to incorporate messaging and the Siri voice command system.) _____ 7. The biggest business deal of the day: Microsoft is acquiring LinkedIn for $26. 2 billion. The move is the latest, and biggest, sign that Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s C. E. O. is betting the future on cloud computing, moving away from the traditional software business that Bill Gates started with. _____ 8. The Supreme Court delivered a setback to Puerto Rico’s efforts to handle its deepening fiscal crisis. The justices rejected the territory’s bid to revive a law that would have let it cut billions of dollars in debt at public utilities. Above, New York’s Puerto Rican Day parade, which took place on Sunday. _____ 9. In the N. B. A. finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors   forcing a Game 6 and staving off elimination in the finals. Big performances from LeBron James and Kyrie Irving helped the Cavaliers send the series back to Cleveland. _____ 10. A judge in Oregon has allowed this retired U. S. Army sergeant to legally choose neither sex and be classified as “nonbinary. ” Transgender rights advocates called it a landmark ruling. Born male, the petitioner, Jamie, took hormone treatments to transition to female, but discovered that neither sex fit. “I’m at peace with my biology,” Jamie said. _____ 11. Lastly, the most ambitious   aircraft yet has passed another milestone. The Solar Impulse 2 soared over New York Harbor this weekend, landing at J. F.

23349,How Should Hillary Clinton Choose a Running Mate? Start With Chemistry - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick and Thomas Kaplan,B,2016-06-20,2016.0,6.0,,"In a college gymnasium this month in Newark, Senator Cory A. Booker introduced Hillary Clinton to the crowd. It took him nearly 13 minutes. He piled praise on her and bashed her Republican rival, quoting Thomas Jefferson, Maya Angelou, Abraham Lincoln and even a 1980s song by Jon Bon Jovi, a New Jersey native. “I hate to contradict Bon Jovi,” Mr. Booker said. “But dear God, Hillary Clinton, you give love a good name. ” Mrs. Clinton waved her arms in the air, as if marking the end of a tent revival that lasted a touch too long. She patted Mr. Booker on the back, a much less effusive embrace than the one she had given to Mr. Bon Jovi, who was standing nearby. Ambitious Democrats like Mr. Booker have started to audition as their presumptive presidential nominee considers who should join her on the national ticket. There is much for Mrs. Clinton to consider, including competence, agreement on policy and geography. Yet Mrs. Clinton’s advisers and those who have gone through the process emphasize an equally important, if more elusive, quality: chemistry. Mrs. Clinton needs a No. 2 who can ease into the insular and often distrusting Clinton orbit. And a running mate whose company Mrs. Clinton genuinely enjoys could help present a joyful picture to voters, after a primary season that was sometimes dreary. “When the chemistry works, it communicates enthusiasm and a team and the likelihood of success and progress,” said Michael Feldman, who was an aide to former Vice President Al Gore. “But it can’t be an arranged marriage with someone she meshes well with on paper,” he added. “It very much has to be real. ” Mrs. Clinton’s aides began collecting information last week on as many as 10 candidates. James Hamilton, a Washington lawyer who is overseeing the vetting, will begin meeting with candidates as early as this week. Senior Democrats, thinking about both the fall election and a potential   in four years, said the right choice would stir up enthusiasm on the campaign trail, enhancing Mrs. Clinton’s strengths while not outshining her or overtaking events. Mrs. Clinton is warm and personable one on one, the Democrats said, which creates an easy camaraderie when she teams up with people she likes. In San Antonio, Mrs. Clinton seemed to light up in the presence of Julián Castro, the city’s former mayor and now the secretary of housing in the Obama administration. She grabbed his hand and thrust it skyward at an outdoor rally, and the two glided naturally on the rope line, snapping selfies. The photos from the event, with Mrs. Clinton, 68, beaming next to Mr. Castro, 41, turned out so well that cable networks often show the campaign’s images of the two together on screen when Mrs. Clinton calls in for phone interviews. On a Saturday night in Youngstown, Ohio, Representative Tim Ryan and Mrs. Clinton made a surprise visit to O’Donold’s Irish Pub and Grill for a couple pints of Guinness. Mrs. Clinton leaned comfortably on the bar next to Mr. Ryan and smiled widely as “Born in the U. S. A. ” blared from the jukebox. Mr. Ryan, holding his pint in the air, as the packed bar followed suit, said, “To Hillary! The next president of the United States. ” Mrs. Clinton threw her head back and laughed, then took a long swig of beer. Last month, at a stop at the Court Street Diner in Athens, Ohio, Mrs. Clinton warmly embraced Senator Sherrod Brown, whose policy expertise Mrs. Clinton has said she admires. They made their way, practically arm in arm, through the narrow   diner, talking to voters and meeting a developmentally disabled man, Noah, whom Mr. Brown introduced to Mrs. Clinton as “my friend. ” “How can you not love Athens?” Mrs. Clinton said. Mr. Brown nodded. Dr. Lillian Glass, a body language expert, was struck by Mrs. Clinton’s ease with Mr. Brown. “Her body is leaning into his, and she never leans into anybody. She adores that guy,” she said in a telephone interview. “And you can tell that he knows his place. You don’t see him trying to take over. ” In many ways, Mrs. Clinton’s search mirrors that of George Bush, who already had deep relationships with major players in Washington by the time he captured the Republican nomination in 1988, Dan Quayle, his running mate, said in an interview. The contenders most frequently mentioned by her advisers and senior Democrats close to the campaign include Senator Michael Bennet, from the key state of Colorado Thomas E. Perez, President Obama’s secretary of labor and a Hispanic civil rights lawyer Representative Xavier Becerra of California and Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both former governors from Virginia. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a favorite of liberal Democrats, though an   ticket is unlikely. All of these candidates have relationships with Mrs. Clinton, and several have appeared with her at campaign events. “This isn’t a   thing,” Mr. Quayle said in a phone interview. “It’s much more the feeling of the two principals, and someone she’s going to feel comfortable with every day. ” Still, a connection can take hold between two candidates on a presidential ticket who are just getting to know each other. In 1992, Bill Clinton selected Mr. Gore, another youthful Southern Democrat, to reinforce his message that a new kind of Democratic Party was emerging. The two men and their young families proved an electric combination on the campaign trail. In a telephone interview, Walter Mondale recalled when he and his wife, Joan, first met with Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter in Georgia in 1976. “Joan said, ‘He’s going to pick you,’” Mr. Mondale said. “I said, ‘Why?’ and she said, ‘Because we all get along perfectly.’ And we still do today. ” Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. did not know each other well when the Obama campaign decided the first   nominee of a major party needed a scrappy and experienced running mate who could appeal to white   voters. Mrs. Clinton has made clear she wants a partner who shares her granular knowledge of policy and who she will enjoy working closely with in the West Wing. Although she is at ease with younger hopefuls like Mr. Castro, Mrs. Clinton has also relished policy conversations with Mr. Perez, a favorite of labor unions, her advisers said. (Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, has expressed concern that selecting Mr. Brown would leave a vacancy in the Senate that a Republican would probably be appointed to fill.) Mrs. Clinton may be forced to ignore such factors, Democrats said, and think about whom she most prefers to spend the next four to eight years working with. “It’s like getting married without any divorce proceedings possible,” Mr. Mondale said. The partnership extends to the running mates’ spouses, who will spend ample time together, and in Mrs. Clinton’s case includes an opinionated former president. Nancy Reagan famously did not like Mr. Bush and his wife, Barbara, but Mr. Bush was determined to “show his skills in figuring out how to make Reagan his friend,” said Joel K. Goldstein, a professor and   expert at Saint Louis University School of Law. Michael S. Dukakis said that he had not spent much time with Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. of Texas before he picked him as his running mate in 1988, but that they ended up getting along well, adding, “Our wives had a great relationship. ” Of course, Mr. Dukakis ran years before social media and a hyperkinetic press corps dissected every aspect of the most critical partnership in politics. That means the comfort level has to be real, or the internet will pick up on any hint of tension and turn it viral. In fact, interest in how the first female presidential nominee at the top of a major ticket would interact with a   nominee is such a source of speculation and intrigue, it has inspired Hollywood writers. In HBO’s comedy “Veep,” Selina Meyer, the foulmouthed title character portrayed by Julia   who stumbled her way into the presidency, is hilariously overshadowed by her charming and more competent running mate. “You never want a vice president that makes people start to think, ‘Boy, it’s a shame he or she isn’t at the top of the ticket,’” said David H. Mandel, an executive producer of the show. “It’s that magical balance. ”"
23360,Hillary Clinton Makes Dire Predictions for Economy if Donald Trump Wins - The New York Times,New York Times,Matt Flegenheimer and Amy Chozick,B,2016-06-22,2016.0,6.0,,"COLUMBUS, Ohio  —   Hillary Clinton pounded away on Tuesday at Donald J. Trump’s business record and economic proposals, seeking to turn his claims of astounding financial success and genius against him and predicting a recession and global panic if he is elected president. In a stern but     speech at an education center garage here, Mrs. Clinton took care to intermingle the policy proclamations of Mr. Trump and his professed image as a business success of the highest order. “Donald Trump has said he’s qualified to be president because of his business record,” Mrs. Clinton said. “A few days ago he said  —   and I quote  —   ‘I’m going to do for the country what I did for my business.’ So let’s take a look. ” Though she leveled predictable blows against various   products, noting that many items  —   Trump ties, Trump steaks, Trump furniture  —   were made outside the United States, Mrs. Clinton’s most pointed refrains sought to depict Mr. Trump, her presumptive Republican opponent, as an enemy to the very people he had claimed to champion in the primary. She checked off the stumbles of his casino business in Atlantic City disparaged his companies’ bankruptcies (Mr. Trump’s many books about business “all seem to end at Chapter 11,” she joked) and insisted that his “one move” in business and politics was to make “   promises” and then let people down. Mrs. Clinton invoked her father, who owned a small drapery business in Chicago, as she described Mr. Trump’s history of failing to pay painters, waiters, plumbers and other contractors who had completed work for him. “My late father was a ” she said. “If his customers had done what Trump did, my dad would never have made it. So I take this personally. ” She added, “This is not normal behavior. ” The barrage comes at a perilous moment for Mr. Trump, who fired his campaign manager on Monday and faces severe disadvantages in   and    organization. One supporter introducing Mrs. Clinton said gleefully that the campaign had more staff members in Ohio than Mr. Trump had nationwide. Although polls often show that voters see Mrs. Clinton as more qualified than Mr. Trump on foreign policy, her economic views have not always been an easy sell. In the Democratic primary race, she was dogged by criticism of her support for trade deals struck during the administrations of her husband and President Obama. Mr. Trump, posting repeatedly on Twitter to counter Mrs. Clinton, said he planned to make his own “big speech” Wednesday to discuss her “failed policies and bad judgment. ” The Trump campaign, which has seldom engaged in rapid response, also sent a barrage of news releases to reporters in an effort to undercut Mrs. Clinton’s arguments. Their subjects included Bill Clinton’s former position on the board of a   college, the loss of manufacturing jobs since 1993 and a slew of negative headlines about economic indicators under President Obama. In one Twitter post, Mr. Trump seemed to embrace a label Mrs. Clinton had tried to make stick: that he had referred to himself as the “king of debt. ” “I am ‘the king of debt,’” Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday. “That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U. S. ” Mrs. Clinton had taken Mr. Trump to task for suggesting that the United States might default on its debts under his leadership, arguing that Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary, “would be rolling in his grave. ” “The full faith and credit of the United States is not something you just gamble away,” she said, predicting that because the global economy “hangs on every word our president says,” even raising the possibility of a default “would cause a global panic. ” At one point, she ridiculed Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he could “sell off America’s assets” if necessary. “Even if we sold all our aircraft carriers and the Statue of Liberty, even if we let some billionaire turn Yosemite into a private country club,” she said, “we still wouldn’t even get close. ” Mrs. Clinton attacked Mr. Trump on several other issues, including immigration and pay equality for women. She also ridiculed Mr. Trump for saying that climate change was a “hoax invented by the Chinese,” noting that it was “a lot easier to say a problem doesn’t exist than it is to actually try to solve it. ” The speech on Tuesday was the centerpiece of a coordinated attack on Mr. Trump’s fiscal sense. On Tuesday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s team released a video, “Bad Businessman,” featuring clips of figures including Mitt Romney and Senators Marco Rubio and Elizabeth Warren insulting assorted   ventures. “What ever happened to Trump Airlines?” Mr. Romney asks in one excerpt, taken from a speech he made in March that struck a similar tone to Mrs. Clinton’s. The campaign introduced a website, Artofthesteal. biz, detailing Mr. Trump’s checkered history in Atlantic City, his father’s role in bolstering his fortunes and his constellation of enterprises. By early evening, Mr. Trump’s team had responded with its own site, LyingCrookedHillary. com, which was not immediately functional but would be in coming days, according to the campaign. In her next scheduled public appearance, on Wednesday in Raleigh, N. C. Mrs. Clinton is expected to shift to a more positive message, outlining her vision for what she has labeled a “growth and fairness economy. ” Her plans include increasing the minimum wage, closing tax loopholes that encourage companies to move jobs overseas and expanding benefits for working families. Mrs. Clinton has leaned this week on an analysis for Moody’s Analytics led by Mark Zandi, who she noted was an economic adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. The report predicted that Mr. Trump’s proposals on trade, taxation immigration and spending would produce a lengthy downturn and significant job losses, particularly hurting   and   workers. Mrs. Clinton quoted from the report during her speech. But moments before her remarks, Mr. Trump’s campaign emailed reporters, noting Mr. Zandi’s ties to Democrats. He has donated to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. As she wrapped up, Mrs. Clinton reiterated a campaign theme  —   “Stronger Together”  —   that has become more prominent in recent weeks, and argued that Mr. Trump “believes in the worst of us” and cannot be trusted at the controls. Mr. Trump still seemed to be watching. “Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State,” he wrote on Twitter. “She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest. ”"

Here’s the latest. 1. “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?” More than 46 million Britons have registered to vote  in Thursday’s referendum, and polls show a statistical dead heat. Proponents and opponents frantically campaigned for a final day. Twitter users tried to lighten the bitter debate, posting photos of their pets as #CatsAgainstBrexit, #DogsForBrexit and the like (even a few hamsters). _____ 2. Dozens of Democratic representatives staged a   on the House floor to demand that the Republican majority hold a vote on a   measure before a weeklong recess begins Friday. The Republican House leaders halted the session, cutting off the   broadcast of the Democratic protest. _____ 3. Donald Trump tried to refocus his campaign after a rough few days. He made his most sustained attack on Hillary Clinton, calling her “a   liar” in a speech that included many inaccurate and misleading statements. Mrs. Clinton, who on Tuesday criticized Mr. Trump’s business and economic ideas, laid out her vision for the U. S. economy. And the Libertarian Party’s candidates, former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, held a town hall tonight. _____ 4. Wildfires burned in at least eight Western states and Alaska, with 31 clustered in a swath of Arizona and New Mexico blistered by a heat wave. Above, Los Angeles clouded in smoke. The Midwest braced for severe thunderstorms that could push across to the Eastern Seaboard. _____ 5. Sunday will see the formal opening of a new set of locks meant to ensure that the historic Panama Canal can handle the new, giant ships crucial to a hyperglobalized world of trade. But our investigation  —   interviews with contractors, canal workers, maritime experts and diplomats, and reviews of public and internal records  —   reveals construction flaws that leave the $3 billion project’s safety and economic viability in doubt. _____ 6. The golfer Rory McIlroy withdrew from the Rio Olympics because of concerns about the Zika virus, a   loss that may encourage more athletes to skip the Games. The event, set for August, has been diminished by the banning of Russia’s track and field team and Bulgaria’s   over doping. It has also been plagued by construction, pollution and national economic troubles in Brazil. _____ 7. One of the world’s longest conflicts appears to be nearing an end after more than 50 years. The Colombian government and FARC rebels said they had agreed to a   at talks in Havana and would hold a ceremony on Thursday. Peace is “not an illusion now, it’s a promise,” the rebels tweeted. _____ 8. A woman close to Prince described for the first time publicly what happened the night he blacked out on a private jet, just days before his fatal overdose. The singer Judith Hill, who was on the plane, said she raised an alarm after “his eyes fixed” and he became unconscious, forcing an emergency landing, treatment with an opioid blocker and hospitalization. She said he promised her that he would get help: “That’s the part that breaks my heart, because he was trying. ” _____ 9. Scientists reported an unnerving discovery: three species of clam that suffered from contagious cancer. The worry isn’t that they could infect humans  —   rather, that infectious cancers may be more widespread than previously understood. _____ 10. Discussions of   measures proliferated a day after a   visitor to Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page noticed that a photo showed his computer camera and microphone jack covered with tape. Security experts say those are sensible precautions everyone should consider, to prevent a takeover by a kind of malware called a   trojan  —   “ratting” for short. _____ 11. “i nvr felt this dark. ” One of our most riveting stories today retraces the steps of a    athlete from Columbus, Ohio, who committed suicide.

23431,"Istanbul, Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",New York Times,Karen Workman and Sandra Stevenson,F,2016-07-01,2016.0,7.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. _____ 1. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said she would accept the recommendations of prosecutors and the F. B. I. about whether to bring charges against Hillary Clinton over her private email server. Ms. Lynch’s statement came after she was criticized for meeting with Bill Clinton at an airport this week. She said the encounter was unplanned and they did not talk about the case. But Republicans and some Democrats said it raised questions about the integrity of the email investigation, which hangs over the presidential election. _____ 2. What should we expect from the Republican convention, just two weeks away? It won’t be “boring” like previous ones, pledged Donald J. Trump, who also said he won’t speak every night. Beyond that, the usually polished and choreographed affair is in flux. But if Mr. Trump’s comments at a Thursday event were any indication  —   he suggested that a plane overhead was a Mexican aircraft ready for an “attack”  —   his     style may be hard to avoid, even if he’s planning to hew more closely to a script. _____ 3. The number of civilians killed by U. S. airstrikes outside conventional war zones since 2009 is between 64 and 116 people, the Obama administration said Friday. The number comes from 473 strikes that took place between Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009 and the end of 2015, and it is much lower than estimates from independent watchdogs. Mr. Obama also issued an executive order requiring the government to disclose the number of civilian deaths annually. Above, a protest against drone strikes in Pakistan. _____ 4. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for an attack in which armed men took hostages in a restaurant in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. A kitchen worker said eight to 10 men entered the restaurant  —   where about 20 foreigners were dining  —   opened fire and detonated several explosives. Two police officers were killed in the standoff. The State Department said all its American employees there were safe. _____ 5. If you’re carrying dollars in your wallet, they’re worth more than they were last week  —   but that’s not necessarily a good thing. Britain’s decision to leave the European Union has investors dumping the pound and the euro, and turning to American currency instead. But that makes U. S. imports more expensive on the global market, complicating the American economy’s already fragile expansion. _____ 6. Austria will have a   on its presidential election, in which a   candidate, Norbert Hofer, above left, narrowly lost to Alexander Van der Bellen of the Green Party in May. The situation reflects the wider turmoil in Europe over immigration, which was also a prominent issue in Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Mr. Hofer and his party, the   Freedom Party, had campaigned heavily on the migrant issue. _____ 7. Tighter security at airports doesn’t necessarily make us safer  —   as seen in the attacks on Tuesday at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport, where three suicide bombers killed 44 people and wounded hundreds of others. Vehicle screenings begin a mile from the airport and people go through security before they enter the terminal, which is where the attackers were initially turned away, but later returned with guns. Here’s a look at how a typical U. S. airport compares with those in Istanbul and other places. _____ 8. A Mississippi law that would have protected people who object to   marriages on religious grounds was struck down by a federal judge minutes before it was to take effect. The judge, Carlton W. Reeves, called it “a vehicle for   discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. ” Some state leaders pledged to appeal, though the state’s Democratic attorney general expressed reservations. _____ 9. Yuliya Stepanova, above, a Russian    athlete who blew the whistle on doping and got other athletes from her country barred, will be among the few from her nation, if any, who can compete at the Olympic Games in Rio. The sport’s governing body ruled that she can compete, and if Olympic officials agree, it’s still an open question whether she would represent Russia  —   which she fled two years ago  —   or be a neutral athlete. _____ 10. Gay Talese, above, the storied journalist and author, is defending his coming book, “The Voyeur’s Motel,” after an article raised questions about key facts. It’s a reversal of his initial response to the discrepancies, in which he called the book’s credibility “down the toilet. ” The issue relates to the veracity of the central character, who said he had spied on his motel guests for years. _____ 11. Mosha, a    elephant in Thailand, got her ninth artificial leg this week. She lost her leg when she stepped on a land mine at just 7 months old in a part of Myanmar where rebels have been fighting the government for decades. She’s among more than a dozen elephants who have been wounded by land mines in the region. _____ 12. Ah, the Fourth of July. It’s a time to celebrate our nation’s independence, perhaps gathering with family and friends for a barbecue before admiring fireworks at dusk. But there’s an unpleasant side to the holiday: a history of ghastly injuries and, sometimes, death  —   generally because of those same fireworks. So have a great holiday weekend and, please, be safe! _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.

23449,Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Calls Donald Trump’s Star of David Tweet Anti-Semitic - The New York Times,New York Times,Katie Rogers,F,2016-07-05,2016.0,7.0,,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign said on Monday that an image posted by Donald J. Trump on Twitter over the weekend that showed a photo of Mrs. Clinton against a backdrop of $100 bills and a Star of David was “blatantly  . ” The post accused Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, of being the “most corrupt candidate ever. ” But critics seized on the episode as the latest example of a longtime pattern of racially charged remarks by Mr. Trump, saying the post was meant to exploit stereotypes against Jewish people. In a rebuke on Tuesday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said in a radio interview with Charlie Sykes on WTMJ in Milwaukee, according to The Hill website: “Look,   images, they’ve got no place in a presidential campaign. Candidates should know that. ” Mr. Ryan added, “I really believe he’s got to clean up how his new media works. ” The backlash has been swift enough to cause Mr. Trump to do something relatively out of character: He deleted the original post, later sharing an image showing Mrs. Clinton next to a circle instead of the   star. The news website Mic traced the first image, posted by Mr. Trump on Saturday, to a message board containing   and   imagery, and to Twitter accounts that circulated the images. Sarah Bard, the Clinton campaign’s director of Jewish outreach, said in a statement: “Donald Trump’s use of a blatantly   image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that it’s a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern. Now, not only won’t he apologize for it, he’s peddling lies and blaming others. ” Though he replaced the image (one observer noted that the tips of the star were still visible in the new post) Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Monday to defend his original decision to post the image with a star. “Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff’s Star, or plain star!” he wrote. In a statement released on Monday night, Mr. Trump dismissed Mrs. Clinton’s campaign’s criticism as “false” and “ridiculous” and repeated his claim that the image was a “basic star often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior. ” But some social media users have disputed Mr. Trump’s suggestion, with one person asking why would he delete a posting if he truly believed it was a sheriff’s star. Mr. Trump’s supporters have insisted that the image never contained a Star of David and that people were being too sensitive or politically correct. Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, appeared on Sunday on CNN and called the reaction “political correctness run amok. ” Other Trump supporters said on Twitter that the news media was exploiting a nonissue. They said they supported the theory that those accusing Mr. Trump of   were creating a fictional subtext for the image. “The only reason the Trump sheriff star tweet is controversial is because CNN makes it that way,” wrote one supporter of Mr. Trump. But white nationalists, including the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, weighed in with praise for the tweet: The   League has long condemned Mr. Trump’s remarks on immigrants as hate speech and stereotyping. It called on him in 2015 to stop “fomenting hatred. ” On Monday, Jonathan Greenblatt, the group’s chief executive, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s handling of the controversy over the posting did not pass muster. “The most appropriate response to the criticisms would be to address them   to apologize, and to articulate firmly and forcefully that bigotry of any sort has no place in this campaign, and that hate has nothing to do with making America great again,” Mr. Greenblatt said. Mr. Trump seemed eager on Monday to move beyond the episode. He posted a flurry of messages about his potential choices for a   running mate: “The only people who are not interested in being the V. P. pick are the people who have not been asked!” He then wrote a post that blamed radical Islam for terrorist attacks."
23462,Attorney General Accepts Recommendation Not to Charge Hillary Clinton - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael D. Shear,M,2016-07-12,2016.0,7.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   The investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server is over, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said on Wednesday. In a brief written statement, she said she accepted the F. B. I. ’s recommendation that no one be charged in the case, which has engulfed Mrs. Clinton’s presidential ambitions for more than a year. “I received and accepted their unanimous recommendation that the thorough,   investigation be closed and that no charges be brought against any individuals within the scope of the investigation,” Mrs. Lynch said. The attorney general said she met with James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. and other prosecutors and agents on Wednesday afternoon before closing the case. Ms. Lynch had promised to accept the F. B. I. recommendations after creating a political furor by meeting on her airplane last week for 30 minutes with former President Bill Clinton. The announcement by Mrs. Lynch came on the eve of a congressional hearing Thursday morning at which Mr. Comey is scheduled to testify about the email investigation and the decision not to pursue charges. Mr. Comey announced his recommendation on Tuesday despite finding that Mrs. Clinton and her top aides were “extremely careless” in their distribution of classified information across unsecured email networks. The apparent contradiction in Mr. Comey’s recommendation is expected to be the focus of sharp, bipartisan questioning at the hearing. But it is unclear whether Mr. Comey will be willing to provide any additional details about the investigation or the process investigators used to reach their conclusions. For Mrs. Clinton, the public announcement by the attorney general formally ends a legal cloud that has been shadowing her campaign and comes just weeks before she will accept her party’s nomination to be president. But as the Republicans’ quick decision to hold congressional hearings proves, the political damage from her use of a private email server is most likely not over. That damage was compounded on Tuesday when Mr. Comey said Mrs. Clinton should have known better than to allow such sensitive material to be sent over an unsecured network. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, said on Twitter, “With the AG accepting Director Comey’s recommendation, this case is resolved, no matter Republicans’ attempts to continue playing politics. ”"
23469,Bernie Sanders Is Expected to Endorse Hillary Clinton Next Week - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy,M,2016-07-08,2016.0,7.0,,"After three weeks of private preparations, Senator Bernie Sanders is expected to endorse Hillary Clinton on Tuesday at a campaign event in New Hampshire, according to three Democrats who have been involved in the planning. The Clinton campaign on Thursday announced the New Hampshire trip but did not provide details, including any mention of Mr. Sanders. Mr. Sanders, in an interview Thursday with Bloomberg View’s Al Hunt, came as close to endorsing Mrs. Clinton as he ever has, saying: “We have got to do everything that we can to defeat Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton. I don’t honestly know how we would survive four years of a Donald Trump as president. ” The three Democrats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal confidential conversations, said that the endorsement was partly the result of daily talks between Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, and the Sanders campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, about bringing together the two rivals and advancing the policy priorities of Mr. Sanders. The discussions included a dinner between Mr. Mook and Mr. Weaver in Burlington, Vt. where Mr. Sanders has his campaign headquarters. One possible obstacle to party unity  —   a fight between Sanders and Clinton allies over a congressional vote on the   Partnership trade deal  —   is not seen as a deal breaker to the eventual endorsement, the Democrats said. Mr. Sanders wants language added to the party’s policy platform opposing any vote on the deal, despite it being a high priority of the Obama administration. Mr. Sanders has been a staunch opponent of the trade pact, and Mrs. Clinton, who once called it “the gold standard in trade agreements,” has come out against it as well. But her allies on the   committee, in line with the wishes of administration officials, have blocked an effort by Sanders allies to insert language opposing it. The Sanders camp will try again at a platform committee meeting in Orlando, Fla. on Friday and Saturday. Mr. Sanders’s endorsement is also expected to ensure that he has a prominent speaking slot at the Democratic convention late this month, the three Democrats said. They added that it was not clear yet when Mr. Sanders would speak or whether the convention would include a full   vote on Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders as candidates for the party’s nomination. Mrs. Clinton has already begun moving toward Mr. Sanders on other issues. On Wednesday she proposed eliminating tuition at   public college and universities for families with annual incomes up to $125, 000 Mr. Sanders, who had supported making public colleges free for all, praised her plan. The Democrats also said that the Sanders campaign was eager to see Mrs. Clinton take another step toward him on the issue of health care, perhaps by making a new commitment to press Congress to add a “public option” to the Affordable Care Act. Mrs. Clinton has long supported the public option, but she also criticized Mr. Sanders during their nomination fight for wanting to reopen congressional debate over   health care debate and replace the Affordable Care Act with   health insurance. The refusal by Mr. Sanders to endorse Mrs. Clinton  —   or even to suspend his campaign after she clinched the nomination on June 7  —   has increasingly turned the senator into an    in the presidential race. President Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton during a joint event in North Carolina on Tuesday, and she is set to campaign with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Pennsylvania on Friday. She also campaigned in another swing state, Ohio, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who shares many progressive policy goals with Mr. Sanders  —   as well as many of his admirers. Senator Warren’s support for Mrs. Clinton, in particular, threatened to marginalize Mr. Sanders among liberals and provide Mrs. Warren with the highly visible role of progressive champion during the fall election. While some allies of Mr. Sanders worry that his endorsement will be     he still has some sway over the 12 million Americans who voted for him in the nominating contest. Mrs. Clinton is eager for party unity, especially since a sizable minority of Sanders supporters is resisting her. With some of them planning to hold events and demonstrations outside the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, there is obvious value to Mrs. Clinton in making peace with Mr. Sanders and having him in her camp. Asked if anything had changed to bring around Mr. Sanders around, the three Democrats said that he wanted to see progress on his policy goals like free public college, but that he was also going through a natural grieving period for his candidacy after a yearlong,   race."
23510,"$2,700 for Hillary Clinton at ‘Hamilton’? That Would Be Enough - The New York Times",New York Times,Matt Flegenheimer,M,2016-07-13,2016.0,7.0,,"How does a former senator . .. stateswoman . .. hoping to build a financial stockpile . .. find a way to make it worth her donors’ while? “Hamilton” tickets. At a special Tuesday matinee,   supporters of Hillary Clinton filed into the Richard Rodgers Theater for a special performance that was, in a rare turn, a touch more expensive than a typical show. But with seats available for $2, 700  —   and status as “event chair” on offer for $100, 000  —   the gathering, held for the Hillary Victory Fund, did include an uncommon guest: Mrs. Clinton, who took the stage after the final bows of a show she has now seen three times. “I cry every time,” she said, after embracing the show’s creator,   Miranda, who left his role as the title character over the weekend but returned on Tuesday to introduce her. Mrs. Clinton, who first attended last year off Broadway, at the Public Theater, took care to establish her “Hamilton” bona fides, to a point. She neither rapped nor rhymed, but she alluded often to some of the show’s signature numbers. “As Washington tells us, history’s eyes are on us,” she said at one point, invoking “History Has Its Eyes On You. ” “Let’s not throw away our shot,” she urged later, nodding to perhaps the show’s most famous song. The musical has become something of a bipartisan cause  —   “the only thing,” President Obama has joked, “that Dick Cheney and I agree on. ” The president headlined a Democratic   last year at the theater. Mr. Miranda has his own political roots: His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr. is a longtime Democratic strategist in New York. The younger Mr. Miranda has, in recent months, urged Congress to assist Puerto Rico in its financial crisis. In his remarks, Mr. Miranda, his   Hamiltonian mane now shorn, made clear his preference for the November election, criticizing Donald J. Trump without saying his name. “Are you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall or for someone who’s building bridges?” asked Mr. Miranda, whose Tony   show is, after all, about an immigrant. He observed that the show had featured, or at least alluded to, the first four presidents. “Right now,” he said, “you’re going to hear from the 45th president. ” Mrs. Clinton, taking the stage to raucous cheers, hugged Mr. Miranda and thanked him for advocating on behalf of Puerto Rico and the families of victims of the massacre last month in Orlando. Speaking for about four minutes, Mrs. Clinton lingered on the message of the show’s final number, “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,” and the meaning of legacy. “It really is true that it matters whose stories are told,” she said, “and heard. ”"
23517,"Hillary Clinton, at Site of Lincoln Speech, Laments G.O.P.’s Turn to Donald Trump - The New York Times",New York Times,Matt Flegenheimer,M,2016-07-16,2016.0,7.0,,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill.  —   On the grounds of the Old State Capitol here, where nearly 160 years ago, Abraham Lincoln held forth on “a house divided,” Hillary Clinton on Wednesday lamented the Party of Lincoln’s transition to the Party of Trump, casting the present moment as an indelible stain on Republican history. Yet even as she savaged Donald J. Trump as an existential threat to American democracy, a week before Republicans plan to nominate him for president in Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton set off on a delicate balancing act of her own. She waded with care into the thickets of national reckonings over police violence and violence against the police, hoping to position herself as an unlikely agent of harmony. And in an uncharacteristic admission, Mrs. Clinton assumed responsibility for at least a small measure of the fractiousness in the national discourse. “I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven’t sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of our progress,” she told a small audience that crowded beneath a grand ceiling here. “So I recognize I have to do better, too. ” Though Mrs. Clinton has for weeks stressed unity as the binding theme of her campaign  —   making speeches in front of “Stronger Together” signs  —   the staging on Wednesday was particularly unsubtle. She immediately invoked President Lincoln, quoting from his speech on June 16, 1858. She spoke slowly and sternly, as if narrating a documentary, railing against a litany of national hardships: gun violence, economic inequality, an overreliance on the police to remedy societal ills. She suggested reassuringly that America had overcome much more than its recent pain and political fury. “The challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln’s time. Not even close,” she said. “But recent events have left people across America asking hard questions about whether we are still a house divided. ” For a candidate not known for soaring oratory, and often not especially comfortable pursuing it, the venue was something of a risky choice, inviting comparisons to some of the most stirring speakers in American history. Nearly a century and a half after Lincoln condemned slavery here, Senator Barack Obama stood before the Capitol in February 2007 to announce his bid for president. Mrs. Clinton’s aides had billed this speech as a major address, hoping to build on remarks last week before black clergy members in Philadelphia, when she urged white Americans to “do a better job of listening when   talk. ” She did touch on the deaths of black men in Louisiana and in Minnesota, and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas, reciting all of their names. She also cited the deaths of five Latinos in     episodeslast week. But during her   remarks, Mrs. Clinton trained her attention largely on Mr. Trump, whose campaign she called “as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. ” In perhaps her most zealous flourish, she noted that Mr. Trump had suggested Tuesday night that he could relate to systemic bias against black Americans because “even against me, the system is rigged. ” “Even this, the killing of black people by police, is somehow about him,” Mrs. Clinton said. As the Republican Party prepares to nominate Mr. Trump next week, Mrs. Clinton seemed inclined to highlight the consequences of that choice at every opportunity. She mocked Mr. Trump’s reference last week to “Article 12” of the Constitution, which does not exist, and wondered about giving him access to the levers of power. “Imagine if he had not just Twitter and cable news to go after his critics and opponents, but also the I. R. S.  —   or for that matter, our entire military,” she said. As she moves to portray Mr. Trump as a purveyor of national chaos, Mrs. Clinton is also seeking to bridge a divide in her own party. Her campaign is hopeful that the   endorsement from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Tuesday will help bring Democrats together in earnest before the party’s convention in Philadelphia in two weeks. Implicit in her comments on Wednesday was a plea for empathy, even for political opponents  —   a striking gesture from Mrs. Clinton, who has long inspired intense partisan passions and was criticized last year for saying in a debate that Republicans were the “enemy” she was proudest to have made. “Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of Donald Trump’s supporters,” said Mrs. Clinton, who speaks often of her family’s   roots. (Her father owned a small drapery business in Chicago.) “We may disagree on the causes and the solutions to the challenges we face,” she continued, “but I believe, like anyone else, they’re trying to figure out their place in a   America. ” Wrapping up, Mrs. Clinton strayed from her prepared text to describe a song from the musical “Hamilton,” which she saw for the third time on Tuesday, telling the crowd that history had its eyes on how Americans respond to this moment. Then she quoted Lincoln once more. “If we do the work, we will ‘cease to be divided,’” she said. “We, in fact, will be indivisible  —   with liberty and justice for all. And we will remain  —   in President Lincoln’s words  —   the last, best hope of earth. ”"
23550,"Donald Trump’s Safe Choice for No. 2 Frees Hillary Clinton’s Hand, Strategists Say - The New York Times",New York Times,Patrick Healy,M,2016-08-22,2016.0,8.0,,"CLEVELAND  —   As Hillary Clinton prepares to announce her running mate later this week, the political calculations have suddenly changed. Had Donald J. Trump chosen a woman or a minority as his   candidate, Mrs. Clinton would have faced pressure from liberals to make her own bold choice. If Mr. Trump had picked a fiery raconteur like Newt Gingrich or Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, two of his finalists, the decision would have given Mrs. Clinton pause about putting a young fresh face on the debate stage this fall  —   rather than an attack dog, according to several Clinton campaign advisers. And if the Republican No. 2 was from a critical swing state, the electoral map might have loomed larger in her considerations. Instead, Mr. Trump picked Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana  —   a   deeply conservative white man from a   state whose record appeals strongly to his party’s base. By choosing someone so conventional, Mr. Trump has made it easier for Mrs. Clinton to follow suit with an unadventurous pick of her own, like Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia or Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa. She could send Housing Secretary Julián Castro out to debate Mr. Pence without fearing a blowout. Or she could pick Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, who is from the reliably Democratic state of Maryland. Mrs. Clinton still has internal Democratic Party politics to contend with, but Mr. Pence is a balm: He puts little if any added pressure on her. “For Trump to get elected, he’s got to expand the group of people he’s talking to and attracting,” said Steve Elmendorf, a veteran Democratic strategist and lobbyist and a Clinton ally. “A different choice by Trump might have changed the electoral calculation for her. But with Pence, Trump will still be losing among women, blacks and Hispanics. ” Mark McKinnon, a key strategist on George W. Bush’s presidential campaigns, said Mr. Pence may have been a good choice for Mr. Trump, but his selection also benefited Mrs. Clinton. “The choice does not   her in any way with constituencies she needs,” Mr. McKinnon said. “It’s unlikely that any alarms are going off at Clinton headquarters. So it leaves her free to hit the snooze button with an equally safe choice. ” In a speech on Monday at the American Federation of Teachers convention in Minneapolis, Mrs. Clinton showed her first lines of attack against Mr. Pence, calling him “one of the most extreme   picks in a generation” who has “worked to undermine the rights of women, workers, L. G. B. T. Americans and immigrants. ” For all the differences between the politically unorthodox Mr. Trump and the   Mrs. Clinton, they both appear to be embracing a golden rule of   selections: First, do no harm. Mr. Trump showed an uncharacteristic abundance of caution in choosing Mr. Pence, the obvious favorite of Washington Republicans like House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and others who have expressed ambivalence about Mr. Trump. Selecting a fellow “pirate,” as Mr. Gingrich has described both himself and Mr. Trump, would have unsettled party leaders and left them bracing on a daily basis for salty language from the candidates and mutiny from disaffected Republicans. “If Trump had picked me, Hillary would have needed a good debater, for sure,” Mr. Gingrich said in an interview. For Mrs. Clinton, the    principle means not choosing a running mate who would exacerbate her unpopularity with white men in crucial industrial and southern states like Ohio and Virginia, and not choosing a candidate who could undercut her emphasis on strong national security experience. Such thinking could count against Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mr. Castro, Mr. Perez and others on her list. More than anything, she is looking to make a careful and responsible choice, her advisers say. “The first criteria is a person who is ready to be president of the United States, and someone who has the skill set and track record to get things done that will make a difference in people’s lives,” said Joel Benenson, the Clinton campaign’s senior strategist. He added that the choice of Mr. Pence was immaterial to Mrs. Clinton, saying, “I don’t think one candidate’s choice of a running mate really factors into who the other candidate picks. ” Yet presidential nominees have their opponents very much in mind as they try to create the strongest possible ticket. In 2012 Mitt Romney chose Mr. Ryan to energize conservatives and sharpen his ticket’s policy differences with the Obama administration. In 2008, Barack Obama wanted Joseph R. Biden Jr. ’s experience and perspective from decades in government. Senator John McCain chose Sarah Palin to appeal to conservatives and reinforce his outsider image. In the current race, both Democrats and Republicans say that Mrs. Clinton has little incentive to risk a   pick like Ms. Warren to counter Mr. Trump’s selection of Mr. Pence, who is little known and so conservative that he may do little to win over moderates and independents. “Secretary Clinton’s goal should be to offer someone who won’t be a big story, someone unquestionably qualified but without much fanfare or controversy,” said Mike DuHaime, who was the top strategist for Mr. Christie’s presidential campaign. “Her goal should be to keep the focus of the campaign on Donald Trump and off of her and her running mate. ” Mrs. Clinton sorely needs to win over liberals and millennials, who strongly favored Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary many of them still doubt her trustworthiness as a progressive and oppose her stands on Wall Street reform, free trade, the minimum wage and fracking. But with these voters, too, Mr. Pence gives Mrs. Clinton some breathing room because of his   conservative positions on abortion and gay rights. Mr. Pence has signed some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, including a bill banning abortion based on a fetus’s race, sex, or disabilities like Down syndrome. He has also opposed   marriage and allowing gays to serve in the military and transgender people to use bathrooms of their choosing. (Mr. Trump has said he opposes abortion with exceptions and that he would be far better for gay Americans than Mrs. Clinton.) While many younger voters would like Mrs. Clinton to pick a liberal like Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren as her running mate, and are wary of, or even hostile to, moderates like Mr. Kaine, Mrs. Clinton’s allies say that Mr. Pence’s positions are so toxic to these voters that they will ultimately unify behind the Democratic ticket. “Pence is so conservative, and a traditional Republican white guy, it frees her up to pick whoever she wants,” said Richard Socarides, a Clinton supporter and gay rights advocate who was an adviser to former President Bill Clinton. But Mr. Gingrich, for one, is skeptical that Mrs. Clinton will have it easy after she announces her selection, which is expected as early as Friday. “She has a twofold problem: Can she find someone who will appeal to undecided independents who see her as crooked or hopeless, and can she find someone who doesn’t continue this headlong rush to the left?” Mr. Gingrich said. “And the left wing of her party is insatiable. Pence may not make her life more complicated, but she still has a very hard problem to solve. ”"
23580,Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine Debut Ticket in Battleground of Florida - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick and Alan Rappeport,B,2016-07-30,2016.0,7.0,,"MIAMI  —   Hillary Clinton debuted her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, to boisterous and bilingual cheers here on Saturday, calling him a “progressive who likes to get things done” even as some liberal Democrats began making clear that they were disappointed with her choice. “I have to say, Senator Tim Kaine is everything that Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not,” Mrs. Clinton said, drawing a quick contrast with the Republican ticket as she introduced her own No. 2 to the nation. Appearing comfortable in his new role as Mrs. Clinton’s top cheerleader and weapon against Mr. Trump, Mr. Kaine bounded up to the microphone, then slipped easily between English and Spanish as he animated the mostly Latino audience by mixing political talk with homey reflections on his life. “Fe, familia y trabajo,” he told the crowd of more than 5, 000 people at Florida International University, explaining that faith, family and work defined his life. But as Mr. Kaine sought to flex his language skills to appeal to Hispanic voters, he and Mrs. Clinton were also trying to mollify a growing backlash from the left against his record of support for global trade deals, which many voters in Rust Belt states blame for the loss of American manufacturing jobs. Mr. Kaine was one of 13 Senate Democrats to vote in support of giving President Obama “fast track” authority on the   Partnership, the   pact that has become a lightning rod this election year. In a clear sign of concern that the issue could be damaging, aides to both Democrats signaled on Saturday that Mr. Kaine would soon publicly adopt Mrs. Clinton’s current position on the deal and say that he no longer supported it in its current form. After praising the   Partnership as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton said during the Democratic primary race against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont that the pact did not meet her “high bar” on protecting American workers. Progressive groups have offered mixed reviews of Mr. Kaine, with MoveOn. org Political Action saying it supports him in light of the “racist, bigoted” message coming from Mr. Trump. Democracy for America, a liberal group that backed Mr. Sanders, agreed with the   sentiment but said the selection of Mr. Kaine was not helpful to the progressive movement. “Kaine’s support for   authority for the     Partnership and recent backing of bank deregulation will make our work more difficult,” said Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of Democracy for America. Liberals looking for a sign from Mr. Sanders himself did not immediately get one. Shortly after Mrs. Clinton offered Mr. Kaine a spot on the ticket, he called Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Sanders, who endorsed Mrs. Clinton only about two weeks ago, did not comment about her   selection or mention it on Twitter on Saturday. A spokesman said Mr. Sanders would most likely discuss the pick in his interviews on Sunday talk shows. Some supporters of Mr. Sanders on social media said the choice of Mr. Kaine was more evidence that their “Bernie or Bust” missions must continue. Others who were resigned to Mrs. Clinton, however, said they could live with her decision. “He is more than competent for the job,” said Steve Todd, a delegate for Mr. Sanders from Pennsylvania. Larry Cohen, an adviser to the Sanders campaign and a former president of the Communications Workers of America, said of Mr. Kaine, “People are minimizing the range of this man by putting him in some box I would argue he doesn’t belong. ” Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine sought to address the complaints  . Mrs. Clinton highlighted his work on fair housing issues and gun control in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech shooting that killed 32 people in 2007, when Mr. Kaine was the governor. “Make no mistake,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Behind that smile, Tim also has a backbone of steel. Just ask the N. R. A. ” The rollout of Mr. Kaine’s candidacy in Florida was no accident. The state is a crucial battleground, and Mrs. Clinton is moving to press her advantage with the state’s Hispanic voters, many of whom have been turned off by Mr. Trump’s   immigration policies. Mr. Kaine, who took a year off from Harvard Law School to work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, wasted little time showing off his bilingualism, often thrusting his fist in the air and looking back and flashing a wide grin at Mrs. Clinton, who sat on a stool behind him. “Bienvenidos!” he told those in the crowd, welcoming them in Spanish and declaring that he and Mrs. Clinton would be “compañeros de alma in this great lucha ahead,” Spanish (mostly) for “soul mates in the fight ahead. ” Mr. Kaine offered a folksy emotiveness that could ease concerns among Democrats that Mrs. Clinton appears too stilted and scripted at times. Mr. Kaine, who dislikes teleprompters, often veered off his prepared remarks, seeming elated to be under such a bright spotlight. Mrs. Clinton seemed to feed off the energy her new running mate gave the crowd as he alternated between zingers about Mr. Trump and a bit of braggadocio. “I’ve never lost an election,” Mr. Kaine said. “I’m not about to let that change. ” Discussing how he weathers attacks from the National Rifle Association and other groups, he said, “That’s just like an extra cup of coffee to me, folks. ” David Axelrod, a former chief strategist for Mr. Obama, criticized Mrs. Clinton’s delivery, writing on Twitter that “someone, at long last, needs to urge her to let the mic do the work!” But he praised Mr. Kaine as “natural, engaging, connecting. ” In an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump’s rollout of Mr. Pence, when he dominated the microphone as his   candidate stood silently for much of the time, Mrs. Clinton perched on a stool, nodding and cheering, behind Mr. Kaine as he spoke for about 40 minutes. During Mr. Kaine’s speech, the Trump campaign sent out emails in rapid succession, citing his “ ” record in Virginia, claiming he lacked any achievements as governor and deriding him as a career politician. After a search that began in April, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers hoped Mr. Kaine could help her bridge the wide divide she faces with male voters, who favor Mr. Trump by 13 percentage points, according to the latest New York   News poll. White men favor Mr. Trump by 26 percentage points. Mr. Kaine’s positions on trade could also hurt the Democratic ticket in this regard. Part of Mr. Trump’s appeal has been his steadfast, if unspecific, promise to bring jobs back to economically depressed parts of the country, largely attributing the decline to the   Partnership, which his own running mate also supported. “Tim Kaine has been praising the   Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved,” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter on Saturday. “Job killer!” Mr. Kaine, though, seemed to relish the fight, criticizing Mr. Trump’s business record and foreign policy positions. “We’ve seen again and again when Donald Trump says he has your back, you better watch out,” he said."

She offered a vision of unity, saying, “When any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit. ” Her speech directly challenged Donald Trump’s ability to lead. “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,” Mrs. Clinton said. Mrs. Clinton was introduced by Chelsea Clinton, who may play a White House role if her mother wins. “I’m voting for a fighter who never, ever gives up,” Ms. Clinton said. _____ 2. Mr. Trump said his call for Russia to hack into Mrs. Clinton’s email was meant as sarcasm. But he also added to his previous praise for Vladimir Putin, saying the Russian president was “a better leader than Obama. ” Above, a short video looking at the history of the   relationship. Mr. Trump’s comments have been criticized by former government officials of both major parties, as well as many foreign policy experts. Some say the security briefings he is now entitled to should be curtailed, while he counters that Mrs. Clinton’s email troubles prove she should not be trusted with the briefings. _____ 3. How is Fox News getting along without its creator, Roger Ailes? Mr. Ailes left under a cloud after a lawsuit accused him of sexual harassment, which then drew corroborating accounts. Nothing looks all that different onscreen in the convention coverage. But when the cameras are off, two people with direct knowledge said, an icy silence descends over the anchor Megyn Kelly, who cooperated with the investigation into Mr. Ailes, and the   Bret Baier and Brit Hume. _____ 4. The   purge being carried out by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has sidelined or jailed half of the country’s top generals and admirals. Some analysts warned of dangerous consequences. “With its main pillar, the military, broken, the Turkish state will no longer be able to check a divided society or effectively counter security threats,” one said. Above, the army’s remaining top officers gathered in Ankara, the capital. _____ 5. U. S. officials say they have new hope against the Islamic State. A trove of more than 10, 000 documents and 4. 5 terabytes of digital data recently seized in northern Syria traces the movements of militants. The information, which is being shared with allies, could help direct battlefield operations and keep plotters from entering Europe. Above, ISIS fighters in 2014. _____ 6.

He rose unharmed. _____ 7. Opposing marches are being held in a mostly white Boston suburb divided by concerns over police shootings and police safety. The galvanizing issue is a “Black Lives Matter” sign hung at City Hall in Somerville, Mass. almost a year ago.

Officials at the Bank of Japan, above, meet Friday to come up with more ways to try to end its country’s long bout with deflation. One option on the table is something economists call helicopter money: dropping money from the sky, to be freely spent. Sadly, that’s just a metaphor. In reality, it means printing more money to pay for government spending on public works, mass distribution of funds to citizens or tax cuts. _____ 9. The weekend is almost here. Got plans? Our movie reviewer says “Jason Bourne,” the fifth installment of the   franchise, may have rote aspects. But he says that tone befits a film that is less a thriller than “a somber meditation on the crisis of the   professional in the throes of middle age. ” And there’s “Bad Moms,” featuring six overachieving female characters summed up by the lines: “We’re killing ourselves to be perfect and it’s making us insane.

23713,"In Michigan, Hillary Clinton Calls Donald Trump Enemy of ‘the Little Guy’ - The New York Times",New York Times,Amy Chozick and Alan Rappeport,B,2016-08-12,2016.0,8.0,,"WARREN, Mich.  —   In a   rejection of Donald J. Trump’s economic policies, Hillary Clinton on Thursday accused him of feigning a connection to the working man, while advocating policies that would “work for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else. ” Seeking to chip away at the perception among   white voters that Mr. Trump is the economic populist in the race, Mrs. Clinton said the Republican nominee merely paid “lip service” to being on the side of average Americans. She repeatedly contrasted his personal wealth with her own   upbringing. “There is a myth out there that he’ll stick it to the rich and powerful because, somehow, at heart, he’s really on the side of the little guy,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Don’t believe it. ” Mrs. Clinton referred to the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that Mr. Trump presented in a speech in Detroit on Monday, saying he “wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself,” which would lead to broad cuts in spending on education, health care and environmental protection. Although she has attacked Mr. Trump’s business record for months, her address on Thursday presented the first opportunity for Mrs. Clinton to deliver a detailed    rebuttal to the economic proposals Mr. Trump unveiled this week. The nearly    addresses on the economy put into sharp relief the candidates’ contrasting positions on an issue that has preoccupied voters throughout the lengthy presidential contest, with Mr. Trump seizing on economic dislocation in mixing populist   positions with traditionally Republican tax cutting, and Mrs. Clinton seeing a strong government hand in creating jobs and driving up wages. Mrs. Clinton called for making the biggest infrastructure investment  —   $275 billion  —   since World War II, and urged aggressive spending on green energy to counter China and Germany. And she repeated her plans to make public colleges and universities   for     families. And she sharply criticized important elements of Mr. Trump’s tax cut plans, particularly the elimination of the estate tax and his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent she said his plan for business owners included what she called the “Trump loophole,” which would “allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his own companies. ” She characterized her opponent’s economic doctrine as a “more extreme version of the failed theory of   economics” mixed with his own “outlandish Trumpian ideas that even Republicans reject. ” And she rejected Mr. Trump’s promises to ease financial regulation and do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he calls detrimental to average Americans. “Even conservative experts say Trump’s agenda will pull our economy back into recession,” and cause the loss of 3. 4 million jobs, Mrs. Clinton said, pointing to an analysis for Moody’s Analytics led by Mark Zandi, who advised Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Mrs. Clinton’s remarks often transcended policy, as she sought to portray Mr. Trump as an    businessman who would squash the working class. She talked about her grandfather’s years of labor in a lace mill in Scranton, Pa. and her father’s small   business in Chicago. “This is personal for me,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I am the product of the American middle class. ” But for all of her efforts, Mr. Trump remains a difficult opponent to critique in traditional ideological terms. Although some of his policies align with those of congressional Republicans, others, like his promise to rip up global trade agreements, break with Republican orthodoxy. And unlike Mitt Romney, whom President Obama effectively portrayed as a cold corporate titan in the 2012 race, Mr. Trump enjoys some of his strongest support among   white voters who believe he cares about people like them. The issue of trade particularly hurt Mrs. Clinton in the primary in Michigan, which is heavily reliant on manufacturing jobs. She narrowly lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, like Mr. Trump, sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton for her previous support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which her husband signed into law, and the   Partnership, which she supported as secretary of state. Before Mrs. Clinton’s speech, Mr. Trump used an address to the National Association of Home Builders in Miami Beach to assail former President Bill Clinton for signing Nafta into law, which Mr. Trump said devastated upstate New York, and he hammered Mrs. Clinton for failing to deliver on a promise she made in her 2000 Senate campaign to bring 200, 000 jobs to the state. “She passed no legislation that helped,” he said. “She couldn’t get out of her own way. ” Mrs. Clinton gave her address after touring the Futuramic Tool  Engineering factory in Warren, which made automotive parts in the past but has diversified to supply parts to the aerospace industry. Praising the company for being at the front line of a potential “manufacturing renaissance,” Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump for taking a dark view of America’s potential. “When Donald Trump visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty and crime,” she said. “He’s missing so much. ” Mrs. Clinton has spent over a year explaining her main economic proposals and did not propose anything new on Thursday. But she did contrast her specific promises with those Mr. Trump offered on Monday. She mocked Mr. Trump’s plan to give tax breaks for child care  —   the brainchild of his daughter Ivanka and intended to appeal to   mothers  —   as a boon to rich families with nannies. And, in contrast to Mr. Trump’s corporate tax reductions, she said she would impose an “exit tax” to penalize companies that move jobs overseas and offer tax incentives to companies that share profits with employees. “Then there’s the estate tax, which Trump wants to eliminate altogether,” she said. “If you believe that he’s as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion. ” But on one issue that has resonated with   voters, Mrs. Clinton played defense on Thursday. Halfway through the speech, she paused. The crowd grew quiet. “I’m sure some of you are thinking, well, that all sounds good, but what about trade?” she said. “After all, Trump talks about it all the time. ” While reiterating her opposition to the   Partnership, she belittled Mr. Trump’s tough talk on trade as empty, noting how he makes   products overseas. “Before he tweets about how he’s really one who’ll put ‘America First’ in trade, let’s remember where Trump makes many of his own products,” she said. “Because it is sure not America. ” Outside the factory setting, a scattering of   protesters held “Hillary for Prison” signs and criticized Mrs. Clinton’s connections to Wall Street. And more than 1, 000 miles away in Florida, Mr. Trump echoed that critique. “She doesn’t have the talent” to   the economy, Mr. Trump said. “If she wanted to do it, she couldn’t because her donors won’t let her. ” Wielding a chart, Mr. Trump said the Obama administration’s policies that Mrs. Clinton wants to continue have led to plummeting home ownership rates and anemic economic growth. He also suggested that Mrs. Clinton wanted to raise taxes by $1. 3 trillion and place more of that burden on the middle class  —   something that she  has not proposed. “Many workers are earning less money in real dollars than they were in 1970,” Mr. Trump said. “And then you wonder why they’re angry. ” In her speech, Mrs. Clinton tried to address voters’ anger over income inequality, but she also tried to frame her plans as the optimistic flip side of Mr. Trump’s pessimistic assessment of the country’s economic prospects, pointing to two Olympic gold medalists. “If Team U. S. A. was as fearful as Trump,” she said, “Michael Phelps and Simone Biles would be cowering in the locker room. ”"

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton released her tax records for 2015, showing that she and her husband paid an effective rate of 35 percent in federal taxes on income of $10. 6 million. The move increased pressure on Donald Trump to reveal his returns, the subject of political and financial speculation. Both candidates added details to their tax policies this week. Mr. Trump would ease business regulations and lower taxes for the wealthy, aiming to boost the economy. Mrs. Clinton would tax the wealthy more heavily and hold the rate for the bottom 95 percent steady. _____ 2. Mr. Trump said he was being sarcastic in labeling President Obama and Mrs. Clinton founders of the Islamic State, comments that appeared to play well at rallies but confused some conservatives. He held two more rallies in Pennsylvania, which has voted Democratic in the last six presidential elections but is crucial to his strategy. Above, Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, introduced him in Erie. Our   podcast today features the   writer Thomas Friedman, discussing his column on Mr. Trump’s “Second Amendment” comment. _____ 3.

Our full Olympic coverage is here. _____ 4.   and   forces are pouring into Aleppo, Syria, intensifying a battle that has trapped hundreds of thousands of civilians with little or no electricity and dwindling supplies of food and water. A merchant in the city described long lines for gas, bare shelves at groceries and hospitals crammed with wounded soldiers, militiamen and residents. “Hopefully there will be an end to the Syrian civilians’ misery,” a doctor said, “but we can’t see a light in the future. ” _____ 5. Vladimir Putin surprised   by dismissing his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, above left, a trusted aide for over four decades. His replacement, Anton Vaino, fits with a recent pattern of younger loyalists displacing an older generation of Mr. Putin’s peers. The Russian president “does not need advice, he needs people who will carry out his orders with as little fuss as possible,” one analyst said. _____ 6. Fox News started rebuilding its leadership, naming two veteran executives as   three weeks after Roger Ailes was forced out over accusations of sexual harassment. One of them, Bill Shine, figured along with other executives in descriptions of a culture of intimidation given by women who accused Mr. Ailes of harassment. Both Mr. Ailes and Mr. Shine have denied any wrongdoing. Rupert Murdoch is expected to continue serving as chief executive until at least the presidential election in November. _____ 7.

Four years after turning into a mocking meme, the work has helped turn its home, the small city of Borja, into a tourist mecca and even inspired a comic opera. The composer said he tried to reflect the tumult of the internet by drawing on “a Gregorian chant, a Spanish fandango, a Renaissance motet, a jota from Zaragoza, a classical chorus, an aria from the Zarzuela, a Flamenco tango, an   hook and a   bass line. ” _____ 9.

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The death toll from a 6.  earthquake in Italy continues to grow, and rescue teams are becoming less hopeful of finding survivors amid the rubble. At least 250 people in central Italy were killed by the quake, which leveled buildings in several towns early Wednesday and has continued to jolt the region with hundreds of aftershocks. Myanmar is also sorting through the damage caused by a different earthquake on Wednesday: Though it was stronger than the one in Italy, only a few deaths have been reported. ______ 2. Hillary Clinton delivered a blistering attack on Donald Trump during a speech in Nevada, accusing him of “taking hate groups mainstream” and giving radical fringe groups a national megaphone. Mr. Trump’s indication that he might retreat from his vow to deport all immigrants who are in the United States illegally drew criticism across the political spectrum, if for different reasons. He appeared at a rally in Mississippi with Nigel Farage, the British politician credited with leading the Brexit movement, who compared voting for Mr. Trump to “doing what we did for Brexit in Britain. ” ______ 3. Regardless of which presidential candidate you’re supporting or whether you even plan to vote this fall, there’s a good chance you’ve seen a lot of political content on Facebook. The social network has been a successful home for partisan pages with names you’ve probably never heard of before  —   their content might be created by people overseas, their audiences are cumulatively in the tens of millions of people and a single website can rake in $60, 000 a month. “It’s like a meme war,” said Rafael Rivero, who runs one of the pages, “and politics is being won and lost on social media. ” So is a lot of money. ______ 4. The Turkish military sent more tanks into Syria as it continued its most significant offensive yet in the conflict there. The effort, backed by American air support, is to oust Islamic State militants from a border town, but Turkish officials have made little secret that the main purpose is to prevent Kurdish militias  —   some of which have been crucial allies of the U. S.  —   from seizing more territory in the region. In Afghanistan, a   siege on the prestigious American University in Kabul killed at least 13 people and wounded dozens. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Afghan government said suspicion had fallen on a faction of the Taliban based in Pakistan. ______ 5. In New York City, our effort to chronicle the life and death of each person murdered this year in one of the city’s deadliest precincts continues: Roberto Rodríguez, a Mexican immigrant, was killed in May. His death became the seventh homicide in the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx, which has since recorded several more. Mr. Rodríguez came to the U. S. hoping to earn money to build a better life for his infant son in Mexico, but wound up in a tangle of gang ties. ______ 6. Hundreds of students at the University of Texas carried brightly colored dildos with them during the first day of classes. Their point was to protest a law that lets concealed handguns be carried on campus. “It’s absurd. So, I thought, we have to fight absurdity with absurdity,” said Jessica Jin, an organizer of the protest. ______ 7. Sonia Rykiel, the rebellious fashion designer who found success by aiming to create “clothes for everyday life,” died Thursday from complications of Parkinson’s disease. She was 86. Ms. Rykiel’s designs celebrated pregnancy, popularized   skirts and sweaters, and caught on with women around the world. Her career spanned nearly a   and left a lasting impact on the industry. ______ 8. Happy 100th birthday to the U. S. national parks system. President Woodrow Wilson signed the act that created the National Park Service on this day in 1916. At the time, there were only 35 national parks and monuments. Today, the service manages more than 400 areas covering about 84 million acres. President Obama added 87, 500 more acres in Maine on Wednesday. ______ 9. Swimming with the dolphins in Hawaii, a popular tourist activity, may soon become a thing of the past. Federal officials have proposed rules that would prohibit swimming with or approaching within 50 yards of Hawaiian spinner dolphins. Tour operators are not pleased. But the presence of boats and swimmers has disrupted the dolphins’ habits and natural behavior, officials said. ______ 10. Lastly, if you’ve always wanted your own newspaper and have $175 to spare, now is your chance. Send the money with an essay to Ross Connelly, above, who is looking for a successor to take over The Hardwick Gazette in Vermont, a weekly newspaper that has been around since 1889.

23970,Hillary Clinton Is Set Back by Decision to Keep Illness Secret - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick and Patrick Healy,B,2016-09-13,2016.0,9.0,,"Shortly after receiving a diagnosis of pneumonia on Friday, Hillary Clinton decided to limit the information to her family members and close aides, certain that the illness was not a crucial issue for voters and that it might be twisted and exploited by her opponents, several advisers and allies said on Monday. To those she did inform, Mrs. Clinton was emphatic: She intended to “press on” with her campaign schedule, she said. Her confidants concluded that she did not want to be challenged over her preference to keep the pneumonia private and continue working. Mrs. Clinton’s inner circle was mindful of both her guardedness and her expectation of loyalty once her mind is made up. And she was optimistic that she could recover over the weekend, when she had only two brief events on her schedule, said the advisers and allies, who insisted on anonymity to disclose private conversations. But Mrs. Clinton’s penchant for privacy backfired. On Monday, her campaign scrambled to reassure voters about her health, a day after she grew visibly weak and was filmed being helped into a van: unsettling images that circulated widely and led her aides to disclose the pneumonia diagnosis two days after the fact. In a phone interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday night, Mrs. Clinton said she had kept her diagnosis a secret because “I just didn’t think it was going to be that big a deal,” and tried to shift the discussion to her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, and his lack of transparency. “It’s really past time for him to be held to the same standards,” she said. Mrs. Clinton’s aides acknowledged that they should have been more forthcoming and said she would release more details about her physical fitness and medical history this week, a concession to the political pressure that she is under because she chose not to reveal her diagnosis sooner. But the manner in which Mrs. Clinton’s illness became public has also revived concerns among supporters, and criticism among detractors, about her seemingly reflexive tendency to hunker down, often citing a “zone of privacy,” when she senses a political threat. Her desire for tight control over personal information deepened during the partisan wars of the 1990s, influenced her use of a private email server as secretary of state and now threatens to make her look, again, as though she has something to hide. “Usually you would think that the truth sets you free, but in the experiences that Hillary Clinton has lived through, that’s not necessarily accurate,” said Jay Jacobs, a Democratic Party leader in New York and close ally of the Clintons. Referring to 1990s investigations of the Clintons, he said: “Whether it’s Whitewater or Travelgate or other things, when the facts came out, it still didn’t solve the problem. They did nothing wrong, but there was still controversy. She is a very private person, and she would rather not put out information that she did not feel needed to be shared. ” The new onslaught of questions about her health and medical records has been deeply frustrating to Mrs. Clinton and her team, who have sought to highlight the disparity between her and Mr. Trump over issues of transparency. Mrs. Clinton has released her tax returns, while Mr. Trump has not. She has provided exhaustive details about her policy proposals, while he has not. And she released considerably more medical information last year  —   in a letter from her physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack  —   than Mr. Trump did in his doctor’s letter, which contained little more than    boasts about his “strength and stamina. ” Yet as much as they want the pressure to be on Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton and her advisers are now on the defensive. “She has been totally transparent on the important issues, including public policy ideas, far more than Trump,” said former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a longtime ally of Mrs. Clinton’s. “But there’s also a combination of a natural desire for privacy and the fear that information will be politically misused. ” Mrs. Clinton has long relied on a   intensely loyal group of aides who share her instincts for political warfare and her skepticism and even hostility toward calls for fuller disclosure. Some of these advisers, like Huma Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills, have worked with her since the 1990s, when Mrs. Clinton complained that a “vast   conspiracy” was targeting her and her husband, President Bill Clinton. Ms. Abedin and Ms. Mills were among those Mrs. Clinton told of her diagnosis on Friday. Neither replied to emails on Monday. Her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said Mrs. Clinton had not wanted her illness to deter her. “She just wanted to plow through it,” he told MSNBC, “and I think that’s part of what’s going to make her a great president. ” Most voters have not been moved by questions about Mrs. Clinton’s health: 74 percent of registered voters said they were unconcerned about her being healthy enough to carry out the job of president, a Fox News poll last month found. But trustworthiness is a glaring problem for Mrs. Clinton. Roughly six in 10 voters said they did not trust her, about the same percentage who said they distrusted Mr. Trump, according to a Washington   News poll released last week. Mrs. Clinton had several opportunities before Sunday to disclose that she had pneumonia, including one at a news conference on Friday where she discussed her plans to defeat the Islamic State, called for a rethinking of the Obama administration’s approach to North Korea and ridiculed Mr. Trump’s praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. (At a   that night, Mrs. Clinton, known for more calibrated phrasings, loosely suggested that half of Mr. Trump’s supporters fell into a “basket of deplorables”  —   bigots of one kind or another, essentially. She apologized the next day.) On Sunday morning, when reporters learned that Mrs. Clinton had departed early from a ceremony in Lower Manhattan for the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, a campaign aide said only that she had been “overheated. ” It was not until more than five hours after the startling video surfaced online, showing an ailing Mrs. Clinton being helped into a van, that her campaign released a statement from Dr. Bardack saying Mrs. Clinton had been told she had pneumonia and put on antibiotics. The statement said she had become dehydrated and overheated at ground zero. The events quickly intensified pressure on both Mrs. Clinton, 68, and Mr. Trump, 70, to be more forthcoming about their health and medical histories. Mr. Trump has said he will release more medical information this week. But they also reinforced a central vulnerability for Mrs. Clinton that has nothing to do with physical  . “Antibiotics can take care of pneumonia. What’s the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems?” David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Obama, wrote on Twitter. Clinton aides have ample reason to be careful on the subject of her health: Political opponents on the right have spread a variety of conspiracy theories insinuating that she is physically unfit for the presidency, and Mr. Trump has fanned those theories, repeatedly questioning her “stamina. ” After Mrs. Clinton had a coughing attack last week, Matt Drudge, editor of The Drudge Report, posted a spoof photo of her traveling press corps wearing surgical masks on her campaign plane. But on Monday, her campaign acknowledged its error. “We could have done better yesterday, but it is a fact that public knows more about HRC than any nominee in history,” Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman, wrote on Twitter in response to Mr. Axelrod. Mrs. Clinton does not plan to return to the campaign trail until Thursday at the earliest, advisers said, and it is unclear how she and her doctor will respond to interview requests about her health. Late Monday, she expressed gratitude to  . “Like anyone who’s ever been home sick from work, I’m just anxious to get back out there. See you on the trail soon,” she said on Twitter, signing her post “H” to indicate that she had written it herself."
24010,"Poll Finds Most Voters Embrace Milestone for Women, if Not Hillary Clinton - The New York Times",New York Times,Mary Jo Murphy and Megan Thee-Brenan,F,2016-09-27,2016.0,9.0,,"On Nov. 8, American voters for the first time in history will see a woman’s name on the ballot as a major party’s nominee for president. A broad majority of voters  —   men and women  —   say they are happy this milestone has been reached, but fully half of them say they would have preferred that that first woman not be Hillary Clinton, according to the latest New York   News poll. The poll looked closely at women’s political views and broader outlook on American life, as well as how the wider society views the role of women. The survey found that women think more progress has been made toward ending sexism than racism in society. They value motherhood more than marriage. They think that sexual harassment is a significant issue in the workplace. And they think the greatest problem facing American women is inequality in pay and career opportunities. Mrs. Clinton is supported by 52 percent of women likely to vote in November, while 39 percent back Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump’s problems with women are significant: 55 percent of female respondents say he does not respect women and about half think a Trump presidency would be bad for women. Only 11 percent think electing him would be good for women, while 45 percent of women say Mrs. Clinton’s election would benefit them. Mrs. Clinton’s nomination has done little to reverse women’s perceptions of gender discrimination in America, and in many cases, their views differ sharply from men’s.   percent of women  —   but just 35 percent of men  —   think there are more advantages in being a man than in being a woman in society today. Majorities of women with a college degree, those who identify as Democrats, those younger than 30, those with household incomes of at least $100, 000, and black women all say men hold an advantage. Asked to name the most important problem facing women today, women cited issues related to gender inequality in the workplace, primarily pay, more than any other. Gender divisions were particularly pronounced on issues related to the workplace.   of women said women in the United States are paid less than men doing similar work, while 55 percent of men held the same opinion. “What I see that as a reflection of is that we have a done a good job on the awareness issue,” said Teresa Boyer, executive director of the Center for Women and Work at Rutgers University. “The negative is that it still exists. ” Women were also more likely than men to say there is “a lot” of sexual harassment in most American workplaces today  —   fully   said so, compared with 18 percent of men. But the same number of men and women, 53 percent, acknowledge that there is “some. ” Younger women and   women are most likely to say there is a lot of sexual harassment. A poll of women conducted for Virginia Slims in 1994 found virtually the same result:   of women said there was some sexual harassment or a lot in the workplace. By a ratio of almost two to one  —   51 percent to 27 percent  —   American women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years. But Joyce Coleman, an   from Southfield, Mich. and a retired human resources consultant, said in a   interview that there had been less progress toward ending sexism. “I’m 71 years old and I was born in Mississippi, so I’ve experienced racism from several different quarters,” Mrs. Coleman said. She said that although racism had not disappeared, there is “a lot more tolerance,” and she could not say the same about sexism because of “things that continue to happen to women in the workplace. ” The nationwide poll was conducted from Sept. 9 through 13 on landlines and cellphones with 1, 770 adults and has an overall margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Men are significantly more likely than women to see themselves as ever being leaders in business or government. Nearly half of men say they could achieve this while less than a third of women do.   women are much more likely than white women to see themselves as leaders (40 percent versus 26 percent). Likewise, women younger than 45 and those with more education or higher incomes are the more likely than other women to think this high level of leadership is achievable. Carla Lytle, a      manages election officials at the Election Commission in Shelby County, Tenn. and is one of the survey participants who sees herself as a leader. “Initially I was a    mom, and I have a large family: eight children,” Ms. Lytle said. “I   them. I think the leadership skills and things I learned at home I was able to bring to the workplace. It’s just hard work and being able to be structured and organized and sustain a vision: having a vision and working for something. ” Women rate success at work as much more important than their appearance in determining how they feel about themselves, but significantly more think that society places a higher emphasis on looks than on their success at work.   percent of women say their appearance is very important in how they view themselves, while 71 percent say society judges them by their physical appearance.   women are far more likely to rate their appearance as very important.   percent of women think Mrs. Clinton is a good role model for women. By contrast, in 2007, during her first campaign for the presidency, a   News poll found that 70 percent considered her a good role model. Willa Speiser, 68, a freelance editor in Warwick, N. Y. plans to vote for her but does not consider her a role model. “I think she’s achieved much of what she has because of who she married,” Ms. Speiser said. “I don’t think she’s a good role model for women because it’s not a life path that a lot of women have available to them. ” Significantly more men than women consider marriage to be very important. While 58 percent of men said being married is very important, just 47 percent of women overall said so. Most women with household incomes over $100, 000, those who identify as Republicans and those between the ages of 30 and 45 said marriage is very important to them. But in roughly equal numbers (almost  ) both men and women said being a parent was very important to them. Women under the age of 30 were least likely to rate parenthood as very important, but still, 59 percent hold this belief. Nancy Brownell, a    retired teacher in Houston, said: “I’ve been married 47 years, and I have a good marriage. But it was another time. Marriage was another thing on your list. You couldn’t at that time go to a hotel and check in by yourself. When I went to college, they locked us into the dorms at 11 at night. ” Today, she said, “I think a woman can do quite well on her own. ”"
24122,No Debate That Hillary Clinton’s Polling Numbers Are Improving - The New York Times,New York Times,Nate Cohn,M,2016-10-01,2016.0,10.0,,"The   polls are beginning to trickle in, and it already seems clear that Hillary Clinton has received a bump after the first presidential debate. A wave of   battleground state surveys released on Friday showed her with a comfortable advantage in New Hampshire, Nevada, Florida and Michigan. The gains suggest she might lead by as much as five percentage points nationwide, up from about two to three points before last Monday’s debate. It’s hard to know whether the shift will last. If you’ve been following The Upshot’s coverage of polling over the last two years, you know that we’re pretty circumspect about shifts in the polls. But no matter how you cut it, the debate is bad news for Donald J. Trump. As we wrote ahead of the debate, it has been hard to make sense of the polls over the last few months. Mrs. Clinton’s lead has bobbed up and down, between two and eight percentage points since the spring. To oversimplify, there are two basic ways to interpret it. One possibility is that every little twist and turn in polls represents a real shift in a volatile race. If that’s the case, perhaps we’ll look back and say that the debate was decisive: The race was very close before, and Mrs. Clinton took a clear lead after. The other interpretation is that the race is stable but that the polls are volatile, as changes in news media coverage affect the likelihood that people respond to surveys or are judged to be likely voters. If this idea is right, it’s harder to evaluate Mrs. Clinton’s debate bounce. From this point of view, big media events  —   like debates and the conventions  —   raise equally large questions about volatility in the polls. After all, the polls really can change for good after a debate or a convention. But other times, the overwhelming news coverage surrounding a debate performance or a political convention is exactly the sort of thing that would cause an illusory shift. Mitt Romney took a narrow lead after the first presidential debate in 2012, but there is considerable evidence that his gains were exaggerated. For that period, the Democrats became less likely than Republicans to respond to surveys  —   what pollsters call differential nonresponse. After the first presidential debate in 2000, George W. Bush surged in the polls  —   going from an   deficit among likely voters to an   lead in the Gallup tracker. But half of the swing was because of changes in who was assessed to be a “likely voter. ” A postelection study found that those swings in   intention had no predictive value it was just noise. So there’s good reason to be cautious about Mrs. Clinton’s rise in the polls. But that doesn’t mean it should be dismissed out of hand. After the first presidential debate in 2004, John Kerry truly did rally to make it a close race. Usually, a good way to test the durability of a swing in the polls is to ask whether it brings the race closer or farther from the   fundamentals, like the president’s approval ratings. A shift that brings the polls in line with the fundamentals might be a little likelier to last than one that cuts the other way. Mr. Kerry’s recovery, for instance, brought the tighter race implied by Mr. Bush’s approval ratings. Barack Obama’s gains in 2008 gave him the considerable advantage implied by the economy and Mr. Bush’s low approval ratings. The opposite could be said of Mr. Bush’s and Mr. Romney’s surges in 2000 and 2012. This year, it’s a lot harder to tell. That’s in part because there is no incumbent president on the ballot, which always makes it a little harder to tell where the natural resting point of a race sits. But it’s also because Mr. Trump is such an extraordinary candidate that many analysts believe the fundamentals will be less significant than usual. In lieu of the traditional fundamentals, here’s something to consider instead: Over the longer term, Mrs. Clinton has led Mr. Trump by around five percentage points nationally. The debate has bumped her poll standing back closer to her   average, and it seems plausible it could stay in that range. The debate has also reinforced doubts about whether Mr. Trump is prepared for the presidency. No matter how you interpret polls, Mrs. Clinton is in a decent position with less than 40 days to go."
24123,What Carmela Soprano Understood About Hillary Clinton - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael Barbaro,M,2016-10-01,2016.0,10.0,,"There’s a forgotten scene in the third season of “The Sopranos” when the wives of the show’s mob crew, sitting inside a local Italian restaurant, turn to the delicate subject of Hillary Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, infidelity and marriage. It’s 2001 and Mrs. Clinton is headed to the Senate. The women assembled around the table, all of whom know their husbands are unfaithful, are simultaneously disgusted by Mrs. Clinton and in awe of her. “I can’t stand that woman,” says Angie Bonpensiero. “I don’t know,” says Rosalie Aprile. “Maybe we could all take a page from her book. ” It’s left to the boss’s wife, Carmela Soprano to sort through her own messy emotions. She veers from instinctive revulsion (“to be humiliated in public then walk around smiling all the time”) to grudging admiration for how a woman not unlike herself, overshadowed by a cheating spouse, has emerged as powerful, independent figure in her own right. “She’s a role model for all of us,” Mrs. Soprano says on second thought, as the wives nod in agreement. In the latest episode of The   we examine a potent electoral force we rarely talk about when we talk about the campaign: pop culture. Both Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump are   stars in their own right, who have spawned  —   and inspired  —   television characters and shows from “The Apprentice” (Mr. Trump) to the “The Good Wife” (Mrs. Clinton). We talk to the chief television critic at The New York Times, James Poniewozik, about how television and film characters past and present inform our views of both candidates  —   or have been created in the candidates’ images. “They are both characters in pop culture, characters in mass media, whose stories we have literally been hearing for decades,” Mr. Poniewozik says of the candidates. “Usually in an election, there’s some narrative of some new character you haven’t encountered before: Barack Obama in 2008, George W. Bush in 2000. Here, it’s two   American television serials having a crossover episode. ” So if this   campaign is a crossover television event, how would Mr. Poniewozik, as a TV critic, review the show? “I think the writers have really taken it over the top. It’s like watching ‘Scandal’ in its eighth season where you just feel that they have exhausted every possible trick and they’re emptying their notebooks at you. ” Would you commit to another season? “I think I’d like to see it recast. ” And we chat with Susan Dominus, of The Times Magazine, about the surprising ways that gender is playing out in pop cultural depictions of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in this campaign, a topic she is studying closely this year. “If we are going to extend gender stereotypes all the way to their worst place, it’s celebrity, lightweight  —   that reads as in some ways feminine and inconsequential or not perceived as a real threat,” Ms. Dominus says. And in that sense, Mr. Trump, in some ways, is the more feminized figure. “For all of his bluster, when was the last time that people were this obsessed with a candidate’s hair?” Ms. Dominus asks. “It was Hillary in 2008!” From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.

24194,"In Second Debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Spar in Bitter, Personal Terms - The New York Times",New York Times,Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin,M,2016-10-10,2016.0,10.0,,"Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton collided in an almost unremittingly hostile debate on Sunday night, a   spectacle of character attacks, tawdry allegations, and Mr. Trump’s startling accusation that Mrs. Clinton had “tremendous hate in her heart. ” In a remarkable political maneuver, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton had smeared women who accused her husband, Bill Clinton, of sexually assaulting or harassing them, seeking to salvage his presidential candidacy after explosive reports about his past lewd comments about women. Tense at first, and then increasingly angry as he grew more comfortable on the attack, Mr. Trump noted that three of Mr. Clinton’s accusers were sitting in the audience. It was one of several moments when Mr. Trump aimed to energize his most conservative supporters and drive a wedge between them and the elected Republican officials who have been abandoning him. He even threatened that if it were up to him, Mrs. Clinton would “be in jail” for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Both candidates were visibly uneasy throughout the debate, even refusing to shake hands at the beginning, as the town hall event unfolded on a small stage in a highly charged atmosphere. It was a deeply ugly moment in American politics, featuring the sort of personal invective rarely displayed by those who aspire to lead the nation. “Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women  —   attacked them viciously,” Mr. Trump said, arguing that the accusations against Mr. Clinton were “far worse” than Mr. Trump’s own remarks in 2005 that he could grope women because he was “a star. ” Mr. Trump apologized for those comments but also repeatedly minimized them as “  talk,” and even tried to blame Mrs. Clinton for raising them in light of Mr. Clinton’s behavior. “She brings up words that I said 11 years ago  —   I think it’s disgraceful, and she should be ashamed of herself, to tell you the truth,” Mr. Trump said to scattered applause. Mrs. Clinton did not specifically rebut his charges about her husband, saying only, “So much of what he just said is not right. ” Instead, she broadened her indictment of Mr. Trump beyond the 2005 recording, assailing him for refusing to show contrition for his many inflammatory statements. “He never apologizes to anybody for anything,” Mrs. Clinton said. She unfurled a litany of his provocations, including his mocking a Gold Star family, accusing a Hispanic judge of being biased by virtue of his ethnicity, ridiculing a reporter who has a disability, and falsely claiming that President Obama was not born in America. “Yes, this is who Donald Trump is,” Mrs. Clinton said about his 2005 remarks. “The question for us, the question our country must answer, is that this is not who we are. ” After a tumultuous political weekend, the debate was watched extremely closely by Republican members of Congress, who are deciding whether to join dozens of elected officials who have broken away from the party’s nominee. Mr. Trump’s performance was   enough that no more Republican officials disavowed him in the immediate aftermath of the debate, and it prompted his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, to assure him via Twitter he would remain on the ticket after Mr. Trump’s “big debate win. ” Mr. Trump’s attacks on the Clintons  —   including a promise that, as president, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton’s email practices  —   were striking even in a presidential campaign that has often seemed like a race to the bottom because of Mr. Trump’s    assaults on his rivals. But no single answer by Mr. Trump seemed sufficient to put to rest the controversy over his 2005 remarks. As much as he apologized, he did not confess or reveal anything new about his treatment of women over the years. Instead, Mr. Trump alternated between sounding chastened or defensive and trying to energize his base, which remains deeply hostile to Mrs. Clinton. He did so by blasting Mrs. Clinton relentlessly over her State Department email and repeatedly interrupting her, barely concealing his contempt. He said again that Mrs. Clinton should be “ashamed” of herself for deleting some of the personal emails she sent as secretary of state. “Oh, you didn’t delete them?” he said sarcastically. Mrs. Clinton, plainly exasperated, shot back: “O. K. Donald. I know you’re into big diversion tonight  —   anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. ” At several points, Mr. Trump expressed his frustration with the moderators, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC, demanding that Mr. Cooper focus more on one of Mrs. Clinton’s biggest vulnerabilities, her email. “Why aren’t you bringing up the emails?” he asked, before flatly accusing the moderators of conspiring against him. “It’s nice, one on three,” he said. Mr. Trump appeared more confident and aggressive than he had in the first debate, often dismissing Mrs. Clinton’s arguments out of hand and painting her as a politician “for 30 years” who had no record of accomplishment. “It’s just words, folks it’s just words,” he said about Mrs. Clinton’s policy proposals.   minutes later, he added, “It’s all talk and no action. ” Mr. Trump made little, if any, effort to appeal to moderate voters, instead hurling a series of insults at Mrs. Clinton. At one point, an audience member pressed him about whether he could be a “devoted president” for all Americans, and he said emphatically that he could be, without acknowledging that his comments over the past year had been extraordinarily divisive. Instead, he attacked Mrs. Clinton. “She calls our people ‘deplorable,’ a large group, and irredeemable,” Mr. Trump said, invoking a comment that Mrs. Clinton made last month disparaging what she said was half of Mr. Trump’s supporters. Mrs. Clinton’s response reflected a strategy of hers throughout the town   debate: trying to engage directly with the undecided voters in the audience who asked some of the questions, and showing her empathetic side. “Mr. Carter,” she said, naming the man who asked the question, “I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I’ve been in public service. I’m proud of that. ” Mr. Trump, however, was far less concerned with connecting with the voters seated in front of him than with attacking Mrs. Clinton in ways that would rally his voters behind him, and against the Republican officials who have been coming out against him. “She’s lied about a lot of things,” Mr. Trump said, contending that Mrs. Clinton’s shift to opposing the   Partnership trade deal was a falsehood. Moments later, he painted her in some of his most vicious language of the campaign. “She has tremendous hate in her heart,” Mr. Trump said. “She has tremendous hatred. ” In that moment and several others, Mr. Trump sought to bait Mrs. Clinton into lashing out, just as she did to great effect during their first debate. But she kept her composure, while Mr. Trump often seemed disgusted and running at a high boil. He even swiped at the Republicans now disavowing him, saying they should have done a better job holding Mrs. Clinton accountable over her emails. “I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen,” he said. He also used a question about Mr. Pence’s   rhetoric on Russia at last week’s   debate to breezily dismiss his running mate. “He and I haven’t spoken, and I disagree,” Mr. Trump said. Mrs. Clinton found herself on the defensive more than in the first debate, as Mr. Trump showed himself capable of some agility. When the moderators challenged her over revelations that in one of her paid speeches, she had asserted that politicians needed a “public and a private position” in making deals, she gave a meandering answer about how her remarks related to the plot of the Steven Spielberg film “Lincoln. ” Mr. Trump pounced. “She got caught in a total lie,” he said. “Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. ” As some audience members laughed, he added, “Honest Abe never lied. ” Mrs. Clinton also had several strong moments, especially early in the debate, when she reminded voters of Mr. Trump’s recent attacks on a former Miss Universe for gaining weight. At one point, Mr. Trump dissembled when he was pressed by a moderator about why he had posted on Twitter before dawn to accuse the beauty queen, Alicia Machado, of recording a sex tape. “It wasn’t ‘check out a sex tape,’” he said at the debate. Mr. Trump had in fact tweeted, “Check out sex tape. ” The night unfolded in dramatic fashion. Shortly before the debate, Mr. Trump held a brief news conference in St. Louis with three women  —   Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey  —   who allege that Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted or harassed them during his years in office in Arkansas or as president. They were joined by a fourth woman, Kathy Shelton, who was 12 when she was raped by a    in Arkansas Mrs. Clinton represented the man, who ultimately pleaded guilty to a reduced charge. Only in the final minutes was there a brief cessation in the warfare. One audience member asked the candidates to cite something positive about each other, and Mrs. Clinton reached for a common answer to such questions. “Look, I respect his children,” she said. “His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. ” Mr. Trump thanked her for the “very nice compliment,” and then offered his own. “I will say this about Hillary: She doesn’t quit, she doesn’t give up,” he said. “She’s a fighter. ” A moment later, after the moderators concluded the debate, Mr. Trump reached out his hand, and Mrs. Clinton shook it."

One event on this date, though, highlights a more serious subject: World Homeless Day. Started in 2010, the day seeks to bring attention to homelessness, a problem that affects tens of millions of people worldwide, according to the United Nations. In the U. S. more than a   people live on the streets or in shelters for temporary stays. But national statistics show that homelessness is declining. And Salt Lake City has been held up as a model. The city’s approach is simple: Before tackling the problems that led someone to become homeless, those in need first receive a place to live. The program is credited with reducing the number of chronically homeless people across the state by 91 percent since 2005. Lloyd Pendleton, who leads Utah’s homeless task force, initially doubted the plan. “I get probably two to five calls a week now,” he said in an interview last year, “wanting to know how we did it. ” For information on how you can help, the National Alliance to End  Homelessness and the National Coalition for the Homeless offer resources.

24272,Outside Money Favors Hillary Clinton at a 2-to-1 Rate Over Donald Trump - The New York Times,New York Times,Nicholas Confessore and Rachel Shorey,B,2016-10-27,2016.0,10.0,,"Six years after a Supreme Court decision opened vast new channels for money to flow into national elections, Democrats have built the largest and   apparatus of outside groups operating in the 2016 presidential campaign, defying expectations that conservative and corporate wealth would dominate the race. A dozen different organizations raised over $200 million through the beginning of October and since May have spent more than $110 million on television, digital, and radio ads in support of Hillary Clinton, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission through Thursday. The handful of organizations backing Donald J. Trump have raised less than half that amount, a steep dive from four years ago, when wealthy Republicans poured hundreds of millions of dollars into groups backing the Republican nominee Mitt Romney. The Democrats’ success this year reflects, in part, Mrs. Clinton’s close personal ties to her party’s elite donors and her allies’ willingness to exploit the 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case far more aggressively than President Obama did. But the Democrats are also deeply indebted to one man: Mr. Trump, whose provocations and tirades  —   along with a loud crusade against his own party’s donors  —   have virtually shut off what once promised to be a    spigot of outside money. “Everyone thought that we would be outspent, that there would be significant operations built at the presidential level for the other candidate,” said Guy Cecil, a former Clinton aide who heads Priorities USA Action, the main hub of big Democratic giving. “That obviously hasn’t happened. ” The biggest groups set up or expanded by conservatives since Citizens United  —   including American Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, and the network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch  —   are absent from the presidential campaign, focusing instead on protecting Republicans in Congress. “Unlike President Obama four years ago, Clinton embraced the outside money game and shrewdly empowered a single group to carry her message,” said Steven J. Law, the president of American Crossroads and its sister organizations, “in contrast to the boardwalk arcade of groups supporting Trump. ” Citizens United paved the way for independent groups that could raise unlimited amounts of money from unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to spend on elections, as long as they did not coordinate with individual candidates or parties. Republican donors moved quickly to seize on the ruling, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the last three national elections, while Democrats struggled to persuade their donors to invest in “super PACs” at the same scale. Mr. Trump’s rivals for the Republican nomination were backed by an array of super PACs and outside groups set up by their allies and former aides, seeming to set the stage for even greater spending in 2016. But Mr. Trump unexpectedly triumphed, exploiting his knack for free publicity and relying on his own fortune and money from   supporters. In part because of that success, Mr. Trump was slow to incorporate super PACs into his general election strategy. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton began personally courting donors for outside groups almost as soon as she entered the campaign in spring 2015. The Democrats’ tentpole is Priorities USA, a    super PAC that has access to the party’s biggest donors and the implicit blessing of Mrs. Clinton, and is now on track to raise $173 million by Election Day. That is more than any equivalent Democratic effort in history, including the controversial   groups set up by wealthy liberals a decade ago to unseat President George W. Bush. The PAC is closely coordinating with environmental and labor activists and other organizations set up to harness support from veterans,   and Latinos. In   meetings at a Democratic law firm in downtown Washington, officials at Priorities have convened representatives of a dozen super PACs and progressive organizations to carve out   turf and share intelligence from organizers on the ground. Several have pooled money with Priorities USA to purchase television and digital advertising through the same media firms, allowing smaller groups to get better rates. (Other   organizations, including labor unions and a super PAC founded by the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, have separately spent significant money on field organizing.) Priorities USA has shared the cost of some major campaigns with Emily’s List, the leading progressive group aimed at electing Democratic women. The super PAC has also given smaller groups access to its digital and video creative studio or shared its own television spots with other organizations to run under their own names. In early October, for example, a super PAC controlled by the Service Employees International Union began a $3 million   campaign targeted at Latino voters in southern Florida and Nevada. The ads, which featured Hispanic families and accused Mr. Trump of bringing “hate, divisiveness and disrespect into our homes,” was originally produced by a team at Priorities USA. Democratic officials said the partnership had yielded better and more authentic advertising and outreach. A group called the Latino Victory Fund, which has run $400, 000 in advertising backed by Priorities, advised the group on how to vary   accents depending on where the ad was running:   Spanish for spots airing around Miami,   accents and word usage for Nevada. “Sometimes we’ve come up with concepts for ads, both digital and television,” said the fund’s interim director, César J. Blanco. “In other instances, Priorities has developed a concept and shared it with us. They’ve shared with us data and polling. It’s been a really great partnership. ” Behind that partnership is an astonishing concentration of liberal wealth. More than   of the total money that groups supporting Mrs. Clinton have raised  —   $133 million  —   comes from just 30 families. Donald Sussman, a hedge fund investor and longtime liberal donor, has donated $19 million to Priorities USA, among the largest amounts any   donor has ever given to a single super PAC. Members of the billionaire Pritzker family, which founded the Hyatt hotel chain, have contributed $14 million to Priorities and other   groups. The liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros has given $13. 5 million, far more than he gave to support Mr. Obama four years ago. As most of the big Republican groups have stayed away from the presidential race, a small constellation of groups run by Trump allies has sprung up in their place, raising $46 million since the beginning of the cycle. The National Rifle Association, one of the few traditional conservative allies to get behind Mr. Trump’s campaign, has put $20 million into a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump and other Republicans. But many of the new Trump groups are getting into the game late, when advertising rates have skyrocketed, and they are competing against one another for donors and turf, sometimes even cannibalizing Mr. Trump’s own  . Another group, Future45, has raised $13 million for ads criticizing Mrs. Clinton, and an affiliated nonprofit group that does not disclose its donors has drawn millions more. But their spending appears targeted at states with competitive Senate races, with the goal of protecting Republicans down the ballot from any damage Mr. Trump might do. Mr. Trump has attracted some generous individual supporters, according to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission through last week. The casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have donated $10 million to groups running advertising against Mrs. Clinton. Bernard Marcus, the   of Home Depot, has provided $7 million to a pair of   super PACs. A surprisingly small donor to Mr. Trump is Robert Mercer, a New York hedge fund executive. Mr. Mercer and his family have invested millions of dollars over the years in conservative advocacy groups and media outlets, some of which are now among Mr. Trump’s biggest supporters. But Mr. Mercer has been relatively parsimonious with the cash he has put into a   super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, contributing just $2 million."
24312,Optimism From Hillary Clinton and Darkness From Donald Trump at Campaign’s End - The New York Times,New York Times,"Michael Barbaro, Ashley Parker and Amy Chozick",B,2016-11-09,2016.0,11.0,,"Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump hopscotched from Pennsylvania to North Carolina to Michigan on Monday in the final, frenzied hours of the presidential campaign, offering clashing closing arguments as the sprawling map of the United States was reduced to a string of   states. Accompanied by rock stars,   old friends and their grown children, the Democratic and Republican nominees pleaded with voters to end a traumatic campaign with an emphatic endorsement of their visions for the country. In Philadelphia, Mrs. Clinton drew the biggest crowd of her   campaign to the vast plaza in front of Independence Hall, where Bruce Springsteen, the balladeer of   America, rhapsodized about her values and the candidate portrayed herself as a protector of freedom and equality. “Tomorrow we face the test of our time. What will we vote for  —   not just against?” Mrs. Clinton asked. “Every issue you care about is at stake. ” She concluded with an appeal to those who have waited decades for a female president. “Let’s make history together,” she said. In Manchester, N. H. Mr. Trump took the stage with his family at Southern New Hampshire University Arena as “God Bless the U. S. A. ” blared, blue laser beams illuminated the dark hall and a smoke machine piped a haze over the crowd. Mr. Trump asked a country polarized over his personality and tactics to embrace his plan to thoroughly shake up Washington. “I am asking for the votes of all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents,” Mr. Trump said, “who are so desperately in need of change. ” The contrasts between the candidates and their messages were on vivid display in the campaign’s last full day. As she embarked on a   tour, Mrs. Clinton gave a sunny and optimistic summation of her candidacy for the White House. “Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive,   America,” she told a crowd in Pittsburgh. Mr. Trump, who campaigned in five states on Monday, took a harsher approach, assailing the “crooked media,” attacking a “corrupt Washington establishment” and mocking Mrs. Clinton over and over. “It’s a rigged, rigged system,” he declared in Raleigh, N. C. “And now it’s up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. ” As the campaign wound down, both candidates dispensed with ritual. Mrs. Clinton, who relishes upbraiding her opponent, toned down her usual assault on Mr. Trump’s conduct and temperament. And Mr. Trump, who normally seeks to convey confidence at all times, sounded uncharacteristically vulnerable. “They say we’ll get a tremendous amount of credit, win or lose,” he said during a rally in Sarasota, Fla. “I said: ‘No, no, no, no. I don’t want any credit if we lose. ’” Despite the ugliness of the campaign, there were signs that Americans were seizing the opportunity to express themselves at the ballot box in large numbers. Turnout in states that allow early voting was high, and in interviews, many voters said they were eager to bring an end to this unusual, exhausting and still suspenseful election. “I’m totally ready for this election to be over,” said Mary Hoch, 54, who attended Mr. Trump’s rally in Sarasota with a “Make America Great Again” hat on her head and a “Deplorable Lives Matter” pin on her shirt. Ms. Hoch predicted a Trump victory. “I think there are a lot of silent Trump voters,” she said. Daniel Saunders, 58, who attended a rally for Mrs. Clinton in Charlotte, N. C. was just as exasperated by the race. “I’m embarrassed by it,” he said. But Mr. Saunders said he believed that Mrs. Clinton would eke out a win. “These things always tighten up, but I think she’ll pull it out,” he said. Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton sent their running mates, families and allies across the country to maximize their reach in crucial swing states. Mr. Trump relied on his three oldest children  —   Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr.  —   along with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican   nominee. Mrs. Clinton deployed President Obama and former President Bill Clinton, as well as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the first lady, Michelle Obama, perhaps the most popular political figure in the country. “Tomorrow, with your vote, you can say that this country has always been great,” Mrs. Obama said. “That it is the greatest country on earth. ” Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, spent much of the day campaigning in North Carolina, which Mr. Obama carried in 2008 but lost four years later to Mitt Romney. “It’s great to see a finish line, isn’t it?” Mr. Kaine said at an outdoor rally in Charlotte. He expressed confidence in the ticket’s chances on Tuesday, but warned supporters against complacency and implored voters to embrace the chance to elect the nation’s first female president. “Every election is important, but not every election will change history,” he said. “If we do what we know how to do, this election will change history. ” Mr. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, started the day with a brisk jog across a windswept tarmac in an unlikely spot for a Republican: Duluth, Minn. It was the Republican ticket’s second stop in   Minnesota in two days, and although few signs point to a Republican upset there, a modest crowd near Mr. Pence’s plane lapped up his attacks on Mrs. Clinton. “It’s almost hard to keep up, all the headlines, all the scandals flowing out of just her years as secretary of state,” Mr. Pence said. Both campaigns conspicuously reached across party lines in their final pitches. In Scranton, Pa. Mr. Trump spoke to what he said were “Democratic voters in this country who are thirsting for change. ” In Ann Arbor, Mich. Mrs. Clinton reminded an audience of her days as an intern for President Gerald R. Ford, a Republican from Michigan, and of all the Republican leaders who have endorsed her this year. “We must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election,” she said. Mr. Trump seemed sensitive to the fact that his final 48 hours on the campaign trail lacked the star power drawn to Mrs. Clinton, who was accompanied by musicians like Jay Z, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Mr. Springsteen. (Collectively, her surrogates have more than 80 Grammy Awards.) “Beyoncé and Jay Z,” Mr. Trump said dismissively. “I like them. ” But, he added mischievously, “I get bigger crowds than they do. ” But the hypercompetitive Mr. Trump could not resist trying to outshine his rival. In Manchester, he read aloud a letter that he said was from Bill Belichick, the coach of the New England Patriots football team. “Congratulations on a tremendous campaign,” it purportedly read. “You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully. ” (A spokesman for the Patriots said he could not confirm or deny the letter’s authenticity Monday night.) As a final flourish, Mr. Trump claimed that Tom Brady, the team’s quarterback and a hero across New England, had cast a vote for him. In a radio interview on Monday, however, Mr. Brady said he had not yet voted."
24327,"Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, New Delhi: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York Times",New York Times,Sean Alfano,M,2016-11-08,2016.0,11.0,," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. We’re providing unlimited access to all New York Times digital platforms through Wednesday.  Here’s what you need to know: • It’s Election Day! Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump made their closing arguments in states that both view as   to be victorious today. Now it’s up to the voters. Despite the ugliness of the campaign, there are signs that Americans are expressing themselves at the ballot box in large numbers. Turnout in states that allow early voting was high, and many voters told The Times that they were eager for the election to end. Here’s what time polls close across the country (and when we might know who won). The first big wave is at 8 p. m. Eastern. And last, our 360 video series takes a peek inside a voting booth. • What to watch for today and tonight. Hispanic turnout is set to vastly exceed the turnout from four years ago, and early voting data indicates that Mrs. Clinton will benefit from the increase. But it’s too soon to know if it will be decisive for her, our writer observes. He says the surge could be enough to overcome Mr. Trump’s strength among white,   voters in Florida and Nevada. “If it does, it will almost certainly win her the election. ” We’ll be tracking the results live after the polls close. Here are two basic paths for what might happen. • Other   story lines. We look at how the F. B. I. in the span of a week, reviewed thousands of emails and again concluded that Mrs. Clinton should not face charges related to her handling of classified information. And how might the election affect stocks? Swings over the course of the campaign suggest that the markets prefer one candidate to the other, our analysis shows. The news media is under intense pressure to avoid any mistakes in projections tonight. “If you don’t get a good grade, 300 million people are going to know,” one executive said. • International roundup. Heavy smog continues to choke New Delhi, where emergency measures are in place to improve air quality. The damage from sustained exposure to high pollution is equivalent to smoking more than two packs of cigarettes a day, experts say. Hong Kong is bracing for more street protests and tough questions about the independence of its courts after China barred two   politicians from taking their seats in the territory’s legislature. And Australia won’t be legalizing   marriage anytime soon. Parliament rejected a bill calling for a nonbinding public vote on the issue, despite polls showing around 70 percent of Australians want marriage equality. • North Dakota oil pipeline. Environmental groups protesting the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation are targeting a new group: banks that have helped finance the project. • Rolling Stone and one of its writers were ordered by a federal jury to pay $3 million in damages to a University of Virginia administrator over a discredited article about a supposed gang rape at the university. • China’s new cybersecurity law will give the authorities far greater control over the internet beginning next summer, raising concerns about freedom of speech and barriers to foreign business. • The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian, Gannett publications and others have announced plans to reorganize, reduce staff, eliminate sections or all of the above. “It couldn’t be happening at a worse moment in American public life,” our media columnist writes, citing the threat of fake news proliferating on social media. • U. S. stocks surged on Monday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Interview with a chess superstar. Sergey Karjakin of Russia became the world’s youngest chess grandmaster at age 12. Now 26, he is about to challenge the reigning world champion, who is 25, in New York. “I don’t play chess for fun, it’s my job,” Mr. Karjakin said. “And I happen to love my job very much. ” • New to read. Zadie Smith’s latest work, “Swing Time,” explores the effects of cultural heritage and politics on identity. Our critic described the book this way: “A novel that showcases its author’s formidable talents in only half its pages, while bogging down the rest of the time in formulaic and predictable storytelling. ” • Tick, tock. If you have a few moments, take our quiz on time. Do you know what the scientific definition of a second is? Hint: It isn’t the time it takes to say “one Mississippi. ” • Recipe of the day. If you’re looking for comfort food this election night, try this   lasagna. And since we’re on the subject of cheese, read about a New York City sandwich that has set off a discussion about the cultural appropriation of food. Britons have been saying a lot of goodbyes in the past few months. They voted to leave the European Union. The prime minister resigned. The leading figures of the   Brexit campaign left the government. And through all this, the news media outside Britain found one expression that worked in multiple languages: “English leave. ” It’s a play on “taking French leave,” which the British use to mean departing abruptly  —   supposedly a reference to the French manner of leaving a social function without saying goodbye. Such nationalist expressions abounded around the 19th century, when rival nations in a disunited Europe settled scores in wars, revolutions and slights. But the Germans also pick on the Poles for evaporating from parties, which the British call an “Irish goodbye. ” (The German weekly “Die Zeit” even graphed the zingers and  .) Of course, the slaps don’t end with departures. Germans can mention, though rarely, “English shopping”  —   that is, theft, as in the colonial past. And references to historic battles get drawn into the mix, too. So the French could say, depending on how Brexit works out, “c’est un vrai coup de Trafalgar,” a true Trafalgar blow, reminiscent of their decisive defeat by the English in 1805.

24494,Hillary Clinton’s Team to Join Wisconsin Recount Pushed by Jill Stein - The New York Times,New York Times,David E. Sanger,M,2016-12-03,2016.0,12.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Nearly three weeks after Election Day, Hillary Clinton’s campaign said on Saturday that it would participate in a recount process in Wisconsin incited by a   candidate and would join any potential recounts in two other closely contested states, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The Clinton campaign held out little hope of success in any of the three states, and said it had seen no “actionable evidence” of vote hacking that might taint the results or otherwise provide new grounds for challenging Donald J. Trump’s victory. But it suggested it was going along with the recount effort to assure supporters that it was doing everything possible to verify that hacking by Russia or other irregularities had not affected the results. In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the Clinton team’s general counsel, said the campaign would take part in the Wisconsin recount being set off by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, and would also participate if Ms. Stein made good on her plans to seek recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Mrs. Clinton lost those three states by a total of little more than 100, 000 votes, sealing her Electoral College defeat  by Mr. Trump. The Clinton campaign had assailed Mr. Trump during the election for refusing to say he would abide by the results if he lost. On Saturday, Mr. Trump responded to the campaign’s decision to join the recount with a statement calling the effort “ridiculous” and “a scam by the Green Party. ” He suggested that most of the money raised would not be spent on the recount. “The results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing,” Mr. Trump said. In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump leads by 22, 177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of 10, 704 votes, and in Pennsylvania, his advantage is 70, 638 votes. Mr. Elias suggested in his essay that the Clinton campaign was joining the recount effort with little expectation that it would change the result. But many of the campaign’s supporters, picking up on its frequent complaints of Russian interference in the election, have enthusiastically backed Ms. Stein’s efforts, putting pressure on the Clinton team to show that it is exploring all options. Mr. Elias used his essay to describe an intensive    effort by the campaign to look for signs of Russian hacking activity or other irregularities in the vote count. Ms. Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday afternoon, about an hour before the deadline. She has raised more than $5 million for the effort, which will now turn to Michigan and Pennsylvania, where there are deadlines in the coming week. In his post, Mr. Elias sounded less enthusiastic than the recount’s many supporters. “Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology,” he wrote, “we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves. ” He added, “Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. ” If Ms. Stein pursues additional recounts, “we will take the same approach in those states as well,” he wrote. But he noted that the “number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states  —   Michigan  —   well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. ” The Clinton campaign will not contribute financially to the effort, which has been funded by small contributions. But it will pay to have its own lawyers present at the recount, campaign officials said. The Obama administration issued a statement to The New York Times on Friday in response to questions about intelligence findings related to Russian interference in the election. In the statement, it said it had concluded that the election was free of interference. The administration issued a second statement on Saturday saying that “the federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day. ” Mrs. Clinton conceded the race to Mr. Trump early on Nov. 9, when it became clear that he would have a large margin of victory in the Electoral College. But as her lead in the popular vote has grown  —   it now exceeds two million votes  —   her base has increasingly pressured her to challenge the results. That has been fueled in part by how aggressively the Clinton campaign spread the word of Russian involvement in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and from the personal account of John D. Podesta, the campaign’s chairman. The campaign also charged that the Russians were behind fake news about Mrs. Clinton’s health, among other stories  —   a claim supported to some extent by recent studies. Some critics saw those accusations as an effort to shift the discussion from mistakes the Clinton campaign had made in taking on Mr. Trump. Mr. Elias’s post offered a revealing look at how much time and energy the campaign had spent in the past two weeks looking for evidence of Russian hacking or other irregularities, and how it had tried to keep those efforts secret.  “Since the day after the election, we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result,” Mr. Elias wrote. “Most of those discussions have remained private, while at least one has unfortunately been the subject of leaks,” he wrote, a reference to conversations between Mr. Podesta and a group of experts that included J. Alex Halderman, a computer scientist with deep experience in the vulnerabilities of voting systems. Mr. Halderman recently put his own post on Medium, describing his suspicions and the case for recounts. But even he doubted that the election result would change."
24863,"For Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, Divergent Paths to Iran Nuclear Talks - The New York Times",New York Times,Mark Landler,M,2016-05-03,2016.0,5.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Early in 2011, after a hectic visit to Yemen, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton landed in the tranquil Arab sultanate of Oman. She was there to talk to Sultan Qaboos bin Said about an idea one of his envoys first pitched to the State Department in the spring of 2009: that Oman serve as a conduit for secret nuclear talks between the United States and Iran. Mrs. Clinton agreed to explore the proposal but was dubious that it would go anywhere. “Even under the best of circumstances,” she wrote later, “this was a long shot. ” It would be 18 months before she took up the sultan on his offer and dispatched a team of diplomats to Oman to meet with the Iranians. Mrs. Clinton, however, was not the only prominent American making discreet trips to Oman in those days. Senator John F. Kerry, then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later her successor as secretary of state, was holding his own meetings with Sultan Qaboos and his trusted emissary, a businessman named Salem ben Nasser  . Mr. Kerry came away convinced that Oman could deliver Iranians who spoke for their top leaders, and he urged President Obama and Mrs. Clinton to open a back channel. “Hillary and company were skeptical,” he said in an interview. The president, on the other hand, was intrigued by the prospect of an Omani channel, twice telephoning the sultan to ask him about it. “He was genuinely curious about trying to find an     approach to change the dynamic,” Mr. Kerry recalled. The Iran nuclear deal, signed last year after months of direct negotiations with Iranian officials, is likely to be remembered as Mr. Obama’s most consequential diplomatic achievement. In Mrs. Clinton’s campaign to succeed him, she is claiming her share of the credit for it. The multinational sanctions regime that she cobbled together helped pull Iran’s government to the bargaining table. The team she eventually sent to Oman, she likes to say, “set the table” for Mr. Kerry’s diplomatic banquet. But the    story of Mrs. Clinton’s role is more complicated than her public account of it. Interviews with more than a dozen current and former administration officials paint a portrait of a highly cautious, ambivalent diplomat, less willing than Mr. Obama to take risks to open a dialogue with Iran and increasingly wary of Mr. Kerry’s freelance diplomacy. Her decision to send her own team, some officials said, was driven as much by her desire to corral Mr. Kerry as to engage the Iranians. Mrs. Clinton, who declined to comment for this article, worried that he was promising too much to lure the Iranians to the table  —   a worry shared by people in the White House. The senator’s aides, meanwhile, suspected that Mrs. Clinton was content to run out the clock on an opening. At one point, a frustrated Mr. Kerry told his chief of staff, David Wade, “If this is going to go anywhere, we have to get people in a room talking. ” Defenders of Mrs. Clinton say that her distrust of Iran was warranted, and that her success in lining up the sanctions makes her the best candidate to handle the next phase of the relationship: enforcing the nuclear agreement. “She’s built one coalition that was tremendously effective in imposing sanctions,” said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton’s top policy adviser at the State Department, who was a member of the team sent to Oman for the talks. “If it comes to it, she can rally the world to both deter and punish Iran. ” The secret history of the Iran nuclear diplomacy, parts of which have never been reported before, lays bare stark differences between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, going back to the 2008 campaign, over how to approach one of America’s most intractable foes. “They shared the same tactic, which was engagement, but they envisioned different endgames,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an expert on Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The president’s endgame was, ‘I’m a guy who can bridge differences. I’ve bridged races and countries all my life, so I’m going to be able to resolve this. ’” “Clinton had a more cynical view of the endgame,” he continued. “‘We’re going to engage them not because we think they’re going to reciprocate, but because when they rebuff us, it will expose the fact that the problem lies in Tehran, and not in Washington. ’” Few would have expected Mrs. Clinton to be in the vanguard of an overture to Iran. During the 2008 campaign, she ridiculed Mr. Obama’s pledge to hold talks with Iran’s leaders without preconditions. She warned Iran that if it ever launched a nuclear strike on Israel, the United States would “totally obliterate” it. Yet the secret channel’s origins go back to her own special adviser on Iran, Dennis B. Ross, who got a visit at the State Department on Memorial Day weekend in 2009 from Mr. Ismaily. He came bearing a sheet of paper outlining an offer by Iran to negotiate with the Obama administration on a range of issues, including the country’s nuclear program as well as its support for Hezbollah. As a general rule, Mr. Ross said, he viewed such proposals “not with a grain of salt, but a small ton of salt. ” But he had gotten to know the Omanis through his work on Middle East peace issues in the 1990s, and he knew their ties to the Iranians were genuine. He said he decided to pass along Mr. Ismaily’s proposal, with a   cover memo, to Mrs. Clinton. She told Mr. Ross to keep talking to him. A few weeks later, the Iranian authorities cracked down brutally on antigovernment protesters, dashing Mr. Ismaily’s hopes to set up a channel and prompting the White House to shift from a strategy of engaging Tehran to one of pressuring it. Mrs. Clinton lobbied China and other countries in the United Nations Security Council to impose harsh new sanctions on Iran, a step widely seen as a crucial lever against the Iranians. Around that time, Mr. Ismaily got another chance to demonstrate his skills as an intermediary. He negotiated the release of three young Americans who had been arrested by Iranian guards while hiking on the border between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan. Oman paid bail for the three hikers, roughly $500, 000 each. In December 2010, several weeks after the release of the first American, Mr. Ross and a senior official on the National Security Council, Puneet Talwar, secretly traveled to Oman to hear from Sultan Qaboos himself how he thought a channel could work. They were impressed by what the sultan told them: He had visited the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and was confident of the country’s seriousness in seeking a nuclear deal. The next January, Mrs. Clinton stopped in Muscat, the capital of Oman, for her own briefing. She expressed doubts that the Iranians could negotiate in good faith, but she agreed to put it to a test. Mr. Obama was more intrigued: He called Sultan Qaboos twice over the next few months to ask him about whether he could deliver Iranians who could speak with the authority of the supreme leader. The White House, intent on secrecy, did not disclose the calls. Mr. Kerry had long nourished the idea of opening lines of communication to Iran, and he saw his chance when he got involved in trying to free the hikers. That put him in contact with the sultan and his emissary. (Mr. Ismaily confirmed this account, but declined to speak on the record about his role in the nuclear talks.) Mr. Kerry visited Oman in late 2011 and the first half of 2012, spending hours with the sultan discussing the possibility of secret talks with Iran. He also met with Mr. Ismaily  —   sometimes in London and Rome, other times in Washington. Later, in a    meeting with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office, Mr. Kerry told him that the only way to test its potential was to meet the Iranians. The State Department and the National Security Council, however, deliberated for months without making a decision. In his zeal to   negotiations, Mr. Kerry passed several messages to the Iranians through Mr. Ismaily. The senator was coordinating his talking points with Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, with whom he had a close relationship. But his aggressive approach alarmed Mrs. Clinton, as well as people at the White House, several former officials said. They worried that Mr. Kerry had promised the Iranians concessions on enriching uranium that the White House was not yet willing to make. Mr. Kerry, these officials said, indicated to the Iranians that the United States would acknowledge, at the outset of the talks, that Iran had a right to enrich uranium for a civil   program. Iran had long demanded that concession, claiming it was guaranteed by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. But the United States had steadfastly refused, and the Obama administration was, at that moment, debating how and when to relax that position. Mr. Kerry denies ever signaling to Iran that it had a right to enrich. “We made it crystal clear to them,” he said. At the same time, he held out to the Iranians the prospect of their having a peaceful nuclear program, and he was dismissive of   in Israel and the United States who demanded that Iran dismantle its nuclear infrastructure. In the fragile atmosphere of early 2012, officials said, Mr. Kerry’s   style came to be viewed as a liability. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama worried that the Iranians would believe Mr. Kerry was speaking for the president. Sometime that spring, Mr. Obama decided that it was time for the executive branch to take over the negotiations. Mr. Kerry did not protest, believing that he had taken the process as far as a senator could. Three years later in Vienna, as secretary of state, he would lead weeks of grinding talks that produced a final agreement. After she left the State Department, Mrs. Clinton diverged from Mr. Obama on a central tactical question: whether to impose harsh new sanctions on the Iranians after they elected Hassan Rouhani, who had run for president seeking better relations with the West to ease Iran’s economic isolation. Mrs. Clinton was swayed by many in Congress, as well as by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who argued Iran was so desperate for a deal that tightening the vise would have extracted better terms. “She would have squeezed them again,” a person who has worked with her for several years said, “and the only debate is what they would have done. ” Mr. Obama feared that ratcheting up the pressure would undercut Mr. Rouhani, unravel the sanctions coalition and doom his diplomatic efforts. He persuaded the Senate to hold off on new sanctions. Mrs. Clinton never made her differences with Mr. Obama public, and she has publicly endorsed his nuclear deal, though with more caveats than her former boss. “It’s not enough just to say yes to this deal,” she declared last October. “We have to say, ‘Yes, and.’ Yes, and we will enforce it with vigor and vigilance. Yes, and we will embed it in a broader strategy to confront Iran’s bad behavior in the region. Yes, and we will begin from Day 1 to set the conditions so Iran knows it will never be able to get a nuclear weapon. ”"

24918,"Hillary Clinton Has Clinched Democratic Nomination, Survey Reports - The New York Times",New York Times,Amy Chozick and Patrick Healy,B,2016-06-07,2016.0,6.0,,"Hillary Clinton became the first woman to capture the presidential nomination of one of the country’s major political parties on Monday night, according to an Associated Press survey of Democratic superdelegates, securing enough of them to overcome a bruising challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders and turn to a brutal   campaign against Donald J. Trump. In a yearlong nomination fight full of surprise twists, from the popularity of Mr. Sanders to the success of Mr. Trump, the revelation that Mrs. Clinton had clinched the nomination was another startling development  —   especially coming on the eve of major primaries in California, New Jersey and other states. Mr. Sanders added to the drama by refusing to accept the A. P. survey and vowing to fight on, while Mr. Trump argued that he had done more for women than Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton was ebullient but also restrained as she received the news at an uncanny moment  —   almost eight years to the day after she ended her campaign against Barack Obama before a crowd of many teary women and girls. On Monday night, she shared the breakthrough with a jubilant audience at a campaign stop in Long Beach, Calif. “I got to tell you, according to the news, we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment, but we still have work to do, don’t we?” Mrs. Clinton said. “We have six elections tomorrow, and we’re going to fight hard for every single vote, especially right here in California. ” Like Mr. Obama eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination with the support of hundreds of superdelegates  —   the party insiders, Democratic officials, members of Congress, major donors and others who help select the nominee. Under Democratic rules, these superdelegates  —   approximately 720 in all  —   are allowed to back any candidate they wish and can change their allegiance any time before the Democratic National Convention in July. Mrs. Clinton has had relationships with many of the superdelegates for years, and her campaign began seeking their support as soon as she entered the race last spring. Mr. Sanders, by contrast, has struggled to win their backing. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders competed most aggressively for   pledged delegates  —   the roughly 4, 000 delegates won through state primaries and caucuses. The A. P. declared Mrs. Clinton the presumptive nominee by reaching out to superdelegates who had not announced which candidate they were supporting, and confirming that enough were backing Mrs. Clinton to get her to the magic number of 2, 383. But her aides were reluctant to proclaim the race over, for fear of depressing turnout on Tuesday  —   especially in California, where the race remains close  —   or appearing to take the victory for granted. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said the A. P.’s call was “an important milestone” but indicated Mrs. Clinton did not intend to declare victory until Tuesday night, when she “will clinch not only a win in the popular vote, but also the majority of pledged delegates. ” Advisers to Mr. Sanders took a dim view of the math. He previously said he would lobby Clinton superdelegates to shift their support to him by arguing that he is the party’s best chance to defeat Mr. Trump, and he particularly plans to target those superdelegates who represent states where Mr. Sanders won primaries and caucuses. The advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Sanders was aiming to win the California primary on Tuesday to bolster his argument to superdelegates that he is the stronger and more popular candidate than Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders, speaking on Monday night at a rally in San Francisco, did not acknowledge the news that Mrs. Clinton had clinched the nomination, and instead defiantly vowed to continue his candidacy to the convention. But he also made clear that Tuesday’s vote was make or break for the future of his campaign. “Tomorrow is the most important primary in the whole Democratic nominating process  —   we are going to win here in California,” Mr. Sanders said. He added that if he could win the Tuesday contests in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico, Montana and do well in New Jersey, his campaign would be “going into that convention with enormous momentum. ” Moments before Mr. Sanders took the stage, former State Senator Nina Turner of Ohio led thousands of supporters in a chant shouting, “Fight on. Fight on. Fight on. ” It was a sentiment shared by many audience members like Alex Borja, 18, of Castro Valley, Calif. who said he was happy Mr. Sanders had not conceded to Mrs. Clinton and hoped he would remain in the race through the summer. “I don’t think it’s fair that they have basically coronated Hillary as the nominee from the beginning and, at this point, Bernie still has a chance to win the delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the convention,” Mr. Borja said. He added, however, that he would vote for Mrs. Clinton if she were the nominee. Mr. Sanders’s campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, issued a sharply worded statement that refused to accept the A. P. survey. “It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgment, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee’s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,” Mr. Briggs said. Mr. Trump struck familiar notes on Monday night on Twitter, attacking Mrs. Clinton as unfit for the presidency, but he also put his own spin on making history during an interview with Fox News. “I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women, more than anybody, in the construction industry,” Mr. Trump said. For Mrs. Clinton, becoming her party’s presumptive nominee is the latest chapter in a remarkable career that has taken her from being the first lady to being one election away from returning to the White House as president. She planned a victory rally on Tuesday in Brooklyn, but by the time The A. P. had called the contest, she seemed to already be in a celebratory mood, ending a campaign slog that had been expected to come to a close after the early contests but dragged on to just before the final votes were tallied, at a “She’s With Us” concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles with John Legend, Christina Aguilera and Stevie Wonder. Mrs. Clinton had for weeks hardly hid her eagerness to put the primary contests against Mr. Sanders behind her and to turn her full focus to the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Trump. Talking to voters at the Hawkins House of Burgers in the Watts section of Los Angeles, Mrs. Clinton promised to take on Mr. Trump “all the time,” and, earlier that day, she urged Mr. Sanders’s supporters to consider the consequences if Mr. Trump captured the White House. “Anyone who’s supported me, anyone who has supported Senator Sanders has a lot at stake in this election in preventing Donald Trump from being our president, which I can barely say,” she told reporters on Monday. But Mrs. Clinton must also work in the coming weeks to improve her own standing with voters, both with Mr. Sanders’s hordes of young supporters and with a majority of registered voters who say they do not like or trust her. Still, many Democratic allies of Mrs. Clinton did not want to wait until Tuesday’s primaries to celebrate, writing Twitter posts and issuing statements hailing her as the nominee and trying to shift the Democratic Party’s focus and the national political conversation to take aim at Mr. Trump. Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor who now advises a   “super PAC,” said in an email: “It’s beyond words incredibly moving for me personally  —   but premature. We don’t want to crush democracy. Still six states tomorrow whose votes must be counted. It’s crucial to encourage people to vote. ” At Mrs. Clinton’s rally on Monday evening in California, several voters expressed exhilaration at her historic victory. “It’s about time,” said Maria Garibay, a retired manufacturing analyst. But others also braced themselves for a final showdown with Mr. Sanders and ferocious fight against Mr. Trump. “I hope Bernie goes out gracefully,” said Helen Satorius, a retired high school counselor. “We need to beat Trump, completely and totally. So I think now he needs to just be willing to unite. ”"
24963,"Donald Trump Returns Fire, Calling Hillary Clinton a ‘World-Class Liar’ - The New York Times",New York Times,Maggie Haberman,F,2016-06-23,2016.0,6.0,,"Donald J. Trump delivered a blistering attack on Wednesday against Hillary Clinton, calling her unreliable and more concerned with herself than with the American people as he sought to regain his footing after a tumultuous month that imperiled his candidacy. In a   speech seeking to build his case against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee by labeling her a “  liar,” Mr. Trump moved to soothe concerns among Republicans alarmed by gaping   wounds after his racial attacks on a federal judge and his   boast after the terrorist shooting in Orlando, Fla. He said Mrs. Clinton would not create jobs, portraying her as a   former secretary of state who “may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. ” “The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control,” Mr. Trump said. The professionalized presentation, with two teleprompters flanking the lectern in a   ballroom of the Trump SoHo hotel in Manhattan, represented a stark contrast to how Mr. Trump has handled the last month of his campaign, and came two days after he fired his   campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Since securing the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump has allowed himself to be pummeled by Democrats, doing little to fashion an overarching message or even to frame his view of the race. But on Wednesday, he moved to regain the offensive, making a forceful case that he chose to enter public service because of his concerns for the country, a contrast he tried to draw with Mrs. Clinton. “She believes she is entitled to the office,” Mr. Trump said. “Her campaign slogan is ‘I’m with her.’ You know what my response to that is? I’m with you, the American people. She thinks it’s all about her. I know it’s all about you. ” The remarks were welcomed by Mr. Trump’s supporters, who have fretted that he is turning the campaign into a referendum on himself instead of President Obama and Mrs. Clinton. Carl Paladino, a Trump ally who was in the room for the speech, said that the candidate “likes to speak extemporaneously” but that his more scripted approach on Wednesday was necessary. “He told everybody why Hillary shouldn’t be there, he gave a factual foundation for those statements,” Mr. Paladino said. “That type of speech has to be scripted. ” Mr. Trump has promised turnarounds in his undisciplined approach before, only to undercut his own remarks in a day or two with a Twitter blast or provocative public remarks. And on Thursday, he heads to Scotland, a business trip tied to his golf courses. The Manhattan address highlighted an intensifying level of combat between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, who in Raleigh, N. C. on Wednesday shot back at the Manhattan businessman for questioning her commitment to her faith just a day before. “As we Methodists like to say,” she told hundreds of supporters, pausing for effect and knowing applause, “do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can. ” Later, she suggested that Mr. Trump’s speech on Wednesday was part of an effort to distract voters from his lack of substance or policy depth. “That’s even why he’s attacking my faith,” she said. “Sigh. ” Mr. Trump sought to portray Mrs. Clinton as responsible for the tumult in the Middle East, but her campaign tried to deprive the speech of attention by announcing that she had received the endorsement of Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George Bush. Mr. Trump explicitly blamed her for the death of United States Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens during the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a diplomatic outpost in Libya. Mr. Trump began his speech with a focused message about jobs and the economy, lamenting a lost era in the United States of bringing change on a grand scale, and the absence of his signature boastfulness added gravitas. But the address was denounced by Mr. Trump’s critics as a patchwork of    sound bites as opposed to a presentation of new ideas. Mr. Trump did little to lay out specifics of his agenda beyond attacking trade deals and immigration. And his new, more sober approach was undercut by factual inaccuracies and embellishments, as well as flimsy claims  —   at one point, Mr. Trump suggested that Mrs. Clinton was probably the victim of blackmail from Chinese hackers who gained access to her email account while she was the secretary of state. Mr. Trump quoted extensively from the book “Clinton Cash,” written by a Republican author who was forced to correct several inaccuracies after the book went to press. He said the United States was the “highest taxed country in the world,” which is not true. He said there might be five Supreme Court vacancies for the next president to fill, a number that has not been suggested before. Mr. Trump overtly appealed to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to back him instead of Mrs. Clinton, borrowing from the senator’s own words to describe her as unfit for office. “Hillary Clinton wants to be president, but she doesn’t have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president,” Mr. Trump said. “When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “Only by me. ” Mr. Trump did use the speech to sand down the edges of his past remarks about Muslims, acknowledging that some people who follow Islam are “peaceful” while never mentioning his proposed ban on Muslim immigrants. With the speech, Mr. Trump was trying to amplify Mrs. Clinton’s high negative poll ratings with voters, a majority of whom view her as dishonest, as he seeks to alter the current trajectory of the presidential campaign. He seized on controversies surrounding the Clinton Foundation and her tenure at the State Department to accuse her of “theft,” adding, “She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund. ” But Mr. Trump, who once lamented in an interview that the turn of the century was the last time America was “great,” provided a hopeful message, suggesting the advent of a second industrial revolution during his presidency. “Massive new factories will come roaring into our country,” he said, “breathing life and hope into our communities. ” That theme, accompanied by his attacks on free trade, is one that Mr. Trump employed to great effect in the nominating fight, and some of his aides believe it could appeal to Sanders supporters in a general election. While Mr. Sanders has yet to endorse Mrs. Clinton, he balked at the idea that his followers would support Mr. Trump. “I suspect he ain’t going to get too many of those people,” Mr. Sanders said on   when asked about Mr. Trump’s courting of his supporters. “I think the vast majority of the people who voted for me understand that Donald Trump, in a dozen different ways, is literally unfit to be president of the United States. ”"
24978,Donald Trump Slips Further Behind Hillary Clinton in New Polls - The New York Times,New York Times,Jeremy W. Peters,M,2016-06-27,2016.0,6.0,,"Weeks of provocative and outlandish behavior have hurt Donald J. Trump’s standing in two new national polls of registered voters, which showed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee falling further behind Hillary Clinton. A Washington   News survey had Mrs. Clinton with a   lead: 51 percent to 39 percent. A Wall Street   News poll had Mrs. Clinton with a smaller advantage of five percentage points. Both polls, released on Sunday, showed Mr. Trump in worse shape than he had been a month ago, as voters in the latest polls expressed doubts about his preparedness and qualifications to lead the nation. Nearly two in three Americans say they think Mr. Trump is unqualified to be president and are anxious about the idea of him in the White House, the   poll found. In contrast, 61 percent think Mrs. Clinton is qualified. Mr. Trump is coming off two particularly damaging weeks for his campaign  —   a period in which he personally attacked a   judge hearing a lawsuit against Trump University, gloated about predicting attacks like the Orlando massacre that left 49 dead, and fired his embattled campaign manager. Despite his woes, not all the results of the new polls were heartening for Mrs. Clinton. The   survey found that her lead essentially disappears when candidates from the Green Party and Libertarian Party are included. She essentially tied Mr. Trump, with 39 percent to his 38 percent. Together,   candidates grabbed 16 percent of the support. Senior aides to both candidates spoke on Sunday morning news shows, and their words left little doubt about the intensity that the race is taking on now that the nominating fights have ended. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said on Fox News Sunday, “Donald Trump is probably one of the most reckless, unfit candidates to ever seek the presidency. ” Mrs. Clinton, he said, is “probably one of the most prepared. ” Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, insisted that he and Mr. Trump had built an operation that was able to take on Mrs. Clinton, addressing concerns from Republicans that their infrastructure is inadequate. “Our campaign is organized,” Mr. Manafort told NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” ”We’re ready, we’re going to have a good convention, and we’re confident that we are not behind the Clinton campaign,” Mr. Manafort added."
24979,Hillary Clinton Surprises by Attending Pride Parade in New York - The New York Times,New York Times,Matt Flegenheimer,M,2016-06-27,2016.0,6.0,,"It is difficult to surprise at New York City’s pride parade  —   that pulsing kaleidoscope of pink unicorn horns and rainbow undergarments, bejeweled miniature dogs and   revelers who seemed to have misplaced their shoes. But around 1:45 p. m. Sunday, beneath a virtually cloudless sky, something was afoot on Christopher Street. Lights flashed. Officers stirred. Sirens pierced the Cher soundtrack wafting over Greenwich Village. Soon, a van door opened. “Hillaryyyyyyyyy!” someone hollered from the sidewalk. And so began a very   chase along the city’s foremost corridor of gay rights. For four blocks or so  —   beginning steps from the Stonewall Inn, the nexus of the modern gay rights movement  —   Hillary Clinton led a mayor, a governor, a phalanx of aides, a crush of reporters and several beleaguered security personnel on a   stroll. It was an unannounced appearance for Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, two weeks after the massacre at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. The tragedy colored the proceedings across several floats and marching groups, lurking like an unwelcome guest. Some attendees dressed in white, with the names and faces of victims displayed on placards hanging from their necks. “We Are Orlando,” a sign read. “One Pulse,” said another. Mrs. Clinton did not speak at the event, smiling and waving and occasionally venturing to the police barricades to shake hands. But her presence resonated, attendees said, communicating a measure of solidarity in a wrenching moment. “It was a nonverbal confirmation of her support,” said Micah Feinberg, 35. Women with rainbow leis around their necks reached for her. Residents overhead pointed cellphones from their open windows. A large rainbow flag flapped against a fire escape. “She’s right here,” a woman said, to no one in particular. “Right here. ” When Mrs. Clinton, moving west, reached Bleecker Street, a group rained confetti from a rooftop. “The next president of the United States!” shouted a man with a microphone. “Make some  . ” Mrs. Clinton waved toward another guest in a rainbow   bathing suit. Moments later, as a “Hillary” chant began to build, she stopped to acknowledge the crowd. Throughout the walk, she was joined by a horde of dignitaries eager to share in her spotlight. These included Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who remain engaged in a protracted feud, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who quickly positioned himself beside Mrs. Clinton and took care not to relinquish his perch. By about 2 p. m. Mrs. Clinton was hustled into a waiting vehicle, waving once more before heading for a flight to Indiana. (In a speech there hours later, she addressed Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, arguing it reaffirmed the need for “steady, experienced leadership” in the presidential race.) Paradegoers remained tickled by her   cameo. “I saw her and was completely dumbfounded,” said Kelsey Roberts, 28, an engineer who said Mrs. Clinton was an inspiration to her in a   field. Mrs. Clinton has marched in the parade before, participating as far back as 2000 during her run for the United States Senate. Her appearance on Sunday came as her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, continues to make the case that he is the true champion of gay rights in the presidential race. In the wake of the Orlando shooting, Mr. Trump has said he is the candidate most able to keep gay and lesbian Americans safe from hate crimes. While Mrs. Clinton remains likely to command the vast majority of support from gay voters, she has had a complicated history with gay rights. As secretary of state, she focused often on international gay rights, urging countries to accept gays and lesbians during a 2011 speech in Geneva. She has since denounced Russia’s treatment of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people, and in March 2013, she endorsed   marriage both “personally and as a matter of policy and law. ” But while much of Mrs. Clinton’s donor base includes gay and lesbian supporters, some have questioned the deliberate pace of her evolution. There are also old wounds from her husband’s administration, which enacted the military policy of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and the Defense of Marriage Act barring federal recognition of   marriages. Mrs. Clinton inspired fresh criticism this year after the death of Nancy Reagan, mistakenly praising Mrs. Reagan’s “  advocacy” concerning H. I. V.  despite the Reagans’ lengthy public silence on the disease. Mrs. Clinton quickly apologized. The crowd on Sunday included a handful of skeptics. “She did it strictly so that we would relate the image of her with the image of pride,” said Lexi Avidani, 24, from Long Island. “And she doesn’t support it. ” Most, though, were more effusive. Wearing a shirt that read, “SPOILER ALERT: HILLARY WINS,” Matt McDermott, 26, marveled at the progress of gay civil rights. “A year ago, we passed marriage equality in the Supreme Court, and a year later, a major party nominee is walking in the pride parade in New York,” he said. “So things change quickly. ” Loretta Tassotti, 55, said Mrs. Clinton’s gesture demonstrated that she was “not afraid. ” “This is not a Trump kind of party,” she added. Ms. Roberts, the engineer, suggested the significance ran deeper. The Orlando victims were so young, she said, that it was essential for presidential candidates to participate in the grief. Ms. Roberts looked out again on the parade route, where a collection of mourners drew near. She reconsidered the question of Mrs. Clinton’s appearance. “How could you not come?” she asked."
25001,Donald Trump Deletes Tweet Showing Hillary Clinton and Star of David Shape - The New York Times,New York Times,Alan Rappeport,M,2016-07-13,2016.0,7.0,,"Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, came under fire on Saturday for posting on Twitter an image of the Star of David shape next to a picture of Hillary Clinton and calling his opponent the “most corrupt candidate ever!” While the   star is used in other contexts, including as a symbol of many Sheriff’s Departments, it has deep meaning in Judaism and the image was overlaid atop a pile of money. It appeared to play into the stereotype of Jews being obsessed with finances. After being derided on social media, Mr. Trump deleted the post and replaced it with one that had a circle instead of the star shape. While Mr. Trump has been working to professionalize his campaign, the Twitter post was the latest example of him making remarks many deem offensive. Several weeks ago, he insinuated that a federal judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University could not be impartial in the case because of his Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump apparently realized the problem with the original Twitter post because he rarely apologizes for his remarks or deletes his posts. His campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Before the post came down, Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, asked on his personal Twitter account, “Why is there a Star of David?” Other commenters were more blunt: Mr. Trump regularly touts his close ties to Jewish people, noting that his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. He also has promised to make the security of Israel a top priority if he is elected president. However, Mr. Trump has frustrated some Jews for initially declining to take a firm stand on the side of Israel when discussing the conflict with the Palestinians. And he angered some last year when he joked about Jews being good with money during a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. Mr. Trump has also been criticized for failing to denounce supporters who have harangued Jewish journalists on social media and at gatherings of white nationalists, and for being slow to disavow the support of David Duke, the former Klansman."
25010,Text of F.B.I. Director’s Remarks on Investigation Into Hillary Clinton’s Email Use - The New York Times,New York Times,,M,2016-07-06,2016.0,7.0,,"Following is the prepared text of remarks by Director James B. Comey on the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s personal email system, as released by the F. B. I. Good morning. I’m here to give you an update on the F. B. I. ’s investigation of Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email system during her time as secretary of state. After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the F. B. I. is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision. What I would like to do today is tell you three things: what we did what we found and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice. This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways. First, I am going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. Second, I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say. I want to start by thanking the F. B. I. employees who did remarkable work in this case. Once you have a better sense of how much we have done, you will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts. So, first, what we have done: The investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in connection with Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email server during her time as secretary of state. The referral focused on whether classified information was transmitted on that personal system. Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system, in violation of a federal statute making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities. Consistent with our counterintelligence responsibilities, we have also investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection with the personal email server by any foreign power, or other hostile actors. I have so far used the singular term, “email server,” in describing the referral that began our investigation. It turns out to have been more complicated than that. Secretary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous mobile devices to view and send email on that personal domain. As new servers and equipment were employed, older servers were taken out of service, stored, and decommissioned in various ways. Piecing all of that back together  —   to gain as full an understanding as possible of the ways in which personal email was used for government work —  has been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of hours of effort. For example, when one of Secretary Clinton’s original personal servers was decommissioned in 2013, the email software was removed. Doing that didn’t remove the email content, but it was like removing the frame from a huge finished jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor. The effect was that millions of email fragments end up unsorted in the server’s unused  —   or “slack”  —   space. We searched through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle could be put back together. F. B. I. investigators have also read all of the approximately 30, 000 emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the State Department in December 2014. Where an email was assessed as possibly containing classified information, the F. B. I. referred the email to any U. S. government agency that was a likely “owner” of information in the email, so that agency could make a determination as to whether the email contained classified information at the time it was sent or received, or whether there was reason to classify the email now, even if its content was not classified at the time it was sent (that is the process sometimes referred to as “ ”). From the group of 30, 000 emails returned to the State Department, 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent 36 chains contained Secret information at the time and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2, 000 additional emails were “ ” to make them Confidential the information in those had not been classified at the time the emails were sent. The F. B. I. also discovered several thousand   emails that were not in the group of 30, 000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014. We found those additional emails in a variety of ways. Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private email domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived government email accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including   officials at other agencies, people with whom a secretary of state might naturally correspond. This helped us recover   emails that were not among the 30, 000 produced to State. Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of email fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013. With respect to the thousands of emails we found that were not among those produced to State, agencies have concluded that three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received, one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential level. There were no additional Top Secret emails found. Finally, none of those we found have since been “ . ” I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional   emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our assessment is that, like many email users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed. Because she was not using a government account  —   or even a commercial account like Gmail  —   there was no archiving at all of her emails, so it is not surprising that we discovered emails that were not on Secretary Clinton’s system in 2014, when she produced the 30, 000 emails to the State Department. It could also be that some of the additional   emails we recovered were among those deleted as “personal” by Secretary Clinton’s lawyers when they reviewed and sorted her emails for production in 2014. The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 2014 did not individually read the content of all of her emails, as we did for those available to us instead, they relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all   emails among the reportedly more than 60, 000 total emails remaining on Secretary Clinton’s personal system in 2014. It is highly likely their search terms missed some   emails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server. It is also likely that there are other   emails that they did not produce to State and that we did not find elsewhere, and that are now gone because they deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery. We have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys. Although we do not have complete visibility because we are not able to fully reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort. And, of course, in addition to our technical work, we interviewed many people, from those involved in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of Secretary Clinton’s personal server, to staff members with whom she corresponded on email, to those involved in the email production to State, and finally, Secretary Clinton herself. Last, we have done extensive work to understand what indications there might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the personal email operation. That’s what we have done. Now let me tell you what we found: Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. For example, seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the Top   Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending emails about those matters and receiving emails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U. S. Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on email (that is, excluding the later “ ” emails). None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by   security staff, like those found at Departments and Agencies of the U. S. Government  —   or even with a commercial service like Gmail. Separately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified information. Only a very small number of the emails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked “classified” in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it. While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified email systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government. With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal email domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving   emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account. So that’s what we found. Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the Department of Justice: In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the F. B. I. has helped collect. Although we don’t normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order. Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past. In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here. To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now. As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case. I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear. I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation  —   including people in government  —   but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the F. B. I. found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization."
25038,"Bernie Sanders Endorses Hillary Clinton, Hoping to Unify Democrats - The New York Times",New York Times,"Amy Chozick, Patrick Healy and Yamiche Alcindor",B,2016-07-13,2016.0,7.0,,"PORTSMOUTH, N. H.  —   After 14 months of policy clashes and moments of disdain, Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, clearing away the last major obstacle to a united front for the party heading into its convention this month and the fall election. Yet for all the smiles and hugs between the former rivals here at their first joint rally, Mrs. Clinton’s next challenge was on vivid display as some Sanders supporters jeered her name and held signs saying “Won’t Vote Hillary” while Clinton partisans hissed “shhhh” and others chanted “unity. ” In the coming weeks, from Mrs. Clinton’s choice of a running mate to her convention speech, campaign commercials and overtures to Republicans, the 13 million voters who backed Mr. Sanders in the primary contests will be watching her for any hint of wavering from their progressive causes. Mrs. Clinton needs to convert many of these liberals and independents in states like New Hampshire and Wisconsin, which Mr. Sanders won and she wants to carry in November. And Mr. Sanders, in his remarks at the rally, signaled what may be her best hope of attracting them: drawing sharp contrasts between her and Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, so his admirers feel they have no choice but to support Mrs. Clinton. Dropping his portrayal of Mrs. Clinton as a captive of Wall Street billionaires and   interests, for instance, Mr. Sanders redirected those sorts of accusations to Mr. Trump, saying his proposed tax cuts would be a windfall to wealthy Americans. “His reckless economic policies will not only exacerbate income and wealth inequality, they would increase our national debt by trillions of dollars,” Mr. Sanders said. Standing beside him at Portsmouth High School, Mrs. Clinton beamed and applauded at first as Mr. Sanders spoke, but the two exuded little warmth and looked stiff  —   especially Mr. Sanders  —   as they waved to the audience and cameras. When he finished speaking, he reached out his hand to her, but Mrs. Clinton went in for a hug and a microphone caught her saying, “You were great, so great,” and “thank you so much. ” Then, in her appeal to his supporters, Mrs. Clinton sought to pick up his political mantle and pledged to overhaul Wall Street and the campaign finance system, two issues that Mr. Sanders largely left for her to address. “It is past time to end the stranglehold of wealthy special interests in Washington,” she said as Mr. Sanders smiled and clapped. Mrs. Clinton did not promise to forgo major donations herself, however: After the endorsement event she flew to New York for a private matinee performance of the hit Broadway musical “Hamilton” for donors who gave $2, 700 to $100, 000 to her campaign or the Democratic National Committee. She tried to strike the right notes, though, such as pledging to uphold “our progressive values. ” “You will always have a seat at the table when I am in the White House,” she said to Mr. Sanders’s backers. For many of those supporters, voting for Mrs. Clinton is still hard to fathom. About 85 percent of Democrats who backed Mr. Sanders in the primary contests said they planned to vote for her in the general election, according to a Pew poll released last week. Yet other polls show that only a small fraction of them would do so enthusiastically. “I’m a Bernie guy,” explained Noah Levin, a college student in Hampstead who wore an “H” for Hillary sticker on his   but said he wasn’t sure he would support Mrs. Clinton in the fall. “I won’t vote for Trump, but November is a long way away,” he said. On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has been focused on winning over independents and   women who are turned off by Mr. Trump, exuding confidence that the young voters and liberals who backed Mr. Sanders will get in line and support her when faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency instead. But behind the scenes, her senior campaign aides have been in frequent contact with Sanders advisers while also trying to build bridges to a wing of the party skeptical of Mrs. Clinton and the brand of moderate politics her husband advanced. Since she clinched the number of delegates needed to secure her party’s nomination on June 7, the campaign has reached out to Mr. Sanders’s supporters, dispatching three top staff members  —   the campaign manager, Robby Mook director of states and political engagement, Marlon Marshall and the top policy adviser, Jake Sullivan  —   to states that Mr. Sanders won, including New Hampshire, Wyoming, Vermont and Washington. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, was in a bittersweet but resolute mood on Tuesday, according to his advisers, as he took the stage with Mrs. Clinton. He was back in a state that once filled his campaign with hope after he crushed Mrs. Clinton by 22 percentage points in the February primary, and he came around grudgingly to supporting her, the advisers said. But he was also determined to make a strong case against Mr. Trump and, in doing so, champion Mrs. Clinton as the only chance to defeat him. Taking the stage together in the high school gymnasium, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders stood before a giant American flag and Mrs. Clinton’s motto, “Stronger Together. ” The clashes in the audience quickly subsided, and Mr. Sanders drew some of his strongest cheers as he described his unexpectedly competitive challenge against Mrs. Clinton and his primary and caucus victories in 22 states. In an odd passage for a concession speech, Mr. Sanders said that Mrs. Clinton had “389 more pledged delegates than we have, and a lot more superdelegates”  —   a reference to party leaders that drew boos from the audience and a steely look from Mrs. Clinton. One person close to Mr. Sanders said that the senator and his wife, Jane, were “putting on a good face” on Tuesday, but that they were disappointed that his campaign had not been more successful after he gave it so much of his energy and rallied millions of people around his ideas. The person, a longtime top political adviser to Mr. Sanders who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the private views of the couple, also said that the senator had resolved to keep his word to endorse the Democratic nominee and that he had been told by some   Democrats that he could become chairman of the committee that would work on trying to carry out a proposed $15 federal minimum wage. Still, Mr. Sanders uttered the words that Mrs. Clinton needed him to say  —   “I am endorsing Hillary Clinton”  —   and aligned himself with her on creating more jobs, raising the minimum wage, expanding access to   health care, combating climate change and offering relief to college students in deep debt. “There is no doubt in my mind that as we head into November, Hillary Clinton is far and away the best candidate,” he said. “It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues  —   that is what this campaign has been about, that is what democracy is about,” said Mr. Sanders, who only three months ago declared that Mrs. Clinton was “unqualified” to be president. As Mr. Sanders delivered his endorsement, the Trump campaign, hoping to appeal to disaffected Sanders supporters, sent out a statement saying, “Bernie is now officially a part of a rigged system” for “endorsing one of the most     Street, and   candidates in the history of the Democratic Party. ” But Mrs. Clinton would not be deterred from her unity message, urging Democrats to come together against Mr. Trump. “With your help, we’re joining forces to defeat Donald Trump, win in November and build a future we can all believe in,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I am proud to be fighting alongside you because, my friends, this is a time for all of us to stand together. ”"

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Mourners lined the streets and police cars filled church parking lots as funerals were held for some of the five Dallas officers killed by a sniper last week. President Obama gathered law enforcement officials, civil rights activists and political figures at the White House and spoke about building trust between law enforcement and communities of color. Our latest poll shows that almost 70 percent of Americans say race relations are generally bad, an extraordinarily high level of racial discontent. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton portrayed Donald Trump as an existential threat to American democracy in a speech in Illinois, and mocked him for egotism and ignorance. She also addressed police violence and attacks on the police, invoking Abraham Lincoln, who in the same spot in 1858 proclaimed that “a house divided against itself cannot stand. ” With enough work for unity, she said, “We, in fact, will be indivisible  —   with liberty and justice for all. ” _____ 3. Mr. Trump, who is in the final stages of choosing a running mate, met with several candidates in Indiana, after his plane broke down. He also called for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign from the Supreme Court. “Her mind is shot,” he tweeted after she publicly disparaged him twice. Separately, our political reporter interviewed dozens of people, including Trump supporters, white nationalists and scholars of race, to understand how Mr. Trump fosters a sense of white identity. “Everyone’s sticking together in their groups,” explained a Long Island housewife, “so white people have to, too. ” _____ 4. “We face a time of great national change,” Britain’s new prime minister, Theresa May, said. It was an understatement, given the country’s internal ruptures and profound uncertainty over the vote to leave the European Union. She appointed Boris Johnson, the provocative former London mayor and Brexit leader, as foreign secretary, naming his predecessor, Philip Hammond, as chancellor of the Exchequer. _____ 5. Ringling Bros. bowing to   concerns, is debuting its new   circus in Los Angeles. Its   show, “Out of This World,” offers some old standbys, like aerialists, a lion tamer and acrobats on horseback, but adds an ice floor, an elaborate narrative and a smartphone app. There are still plenty of animals: tigers, dogs, pigs and even a kangaroo. _____ 6. Police officers flooded a gritty patch of Brooklyn, N. Y. a day after 33 people suffered what appeared to be overdoses of synthetic marijuana known as   or Spice. “It’s like a scene out of a zombie movie, a horrible scene,” said a man who saw three people collapse. Mayor Bill de Blasio said any stores found selling the drug would be shut down, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo compared its prevalence to the crack epidemic. _____ 7. The renowned portraitist Chuck Close, 76, has radically upended his style and his life, leaving his wife and worrying his children. In one of our   stories today, a man who has known the artist for years grapples with the metamorphosis. “He was producing startling new work that I wanted to understand,” the author writes, “but it seemed to emerge from a spirit of liberation that left a path of devastation behind. ” _____ 8. The U. N. Security Council met to decide whether to send more troops to South Sudan, where a devastating civil war has entered its third year. The U. N. peacekeepers have struggled with the mandate to protect civilians, coming under harsh criticism for failing to prevent an ethnic massacre at this U. N. camp in  . _____ 9.

25116,"Hillary Clinton Leads Donald Trump in New Hampshire and Florida, Polls Show - The New York Times",New York Times,Katharine Q. Seelye,F,2016-08-05,2016.0,8.0,,"Three months before the November election, voters in New Hampshire, long one of the purple swing states in presidential elections, clearly favor Hillary Clinton over Donald J. Trump, according to a new poll. And another poll shows Mrs. Clinton holding a narrower lead in Florida. New Hampshire voters who either prefer or lean toward Mrs. Clinton outnumber those who prefer or lean toward Mr. Trump by 47 percent to 32 percent, according to the poll, conducted for WBUR, an NPR station in Boston, by the MassInc Polling Group. Gary Johnson, a Libertarian, was favored by 8 percent. Mrs. Clinton’s standing represents a remarkable turnaround for a candidate who lost New Hampshire’s Democratic primary in February. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont clobbered her, 60 percent to 38 percent. But against Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton does much better. While 48 percent say she is fit to be president, only 31 percent say that of Mr. Trump. Nationally, according to a new Fox News poll, Mrs. Clinton holds a   lead over Mr. Trump. Still, even in New Hampshire, it is not all smooth sailing for her: 46 percent of voters there say Mrs. Clinton is not fit to be president, and 29 percent think she should be sent to prison for her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. But 56 percent of New Hampshire voters say she came out of her convention a stronger candidate, and only 39 percent said the same of Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, 63 percent say Mr. Trump is not fit to be president. The survey, of 609 likely voters, was conducted from July 29 to Aug. 1 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Mrs. Clinton is also leading at this juncture in Florida, a major swing state that would be crucial to any Trump strategy for winning nationwide. Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump in Florida by six percentage points, 48 percent to 42 percent, according to a poll released Thursday by Suffolk University in Boston. In a   race, her lead narrows to 43 percent over 39 percent for Mr. Trump Mr. Johnson wins 4 percent of the vote, and Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, wins 3 percent."
25180,Foundation Ties Bedevil Hillary Clinton’s Presidential Campaign - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick and Steve Eder,B,2016-08-26,2016.0,8.0,,"The kingdom of Saudi Arabia donated more than $10 million. Through a foundation, so did the    of a former Ukrainian president whose government was widely criticized for corruption and the murder of journalists. A   developer with vast business interests contributed as much as $5 million. For years the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation thrived largely on the generosity of foreign donors and individuals who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the global charity. But now, as Mrs. Clinton seeks the White House, the funding of the sprawling philanthropy has become an Achilles’ heel for her campaign and, if she is victorious, potentially her administration as well. With Mrs. Clinton facing accusations of favoritism toward Clinton Foundation donors during her time as secretary of state, former President Bill Clinton told foundation employees on Thursday that the organization would no longer accept foreign or corporate donations should Mrs. Clinton win in November. But while the move could avoid the awkwardness of Mr. Clinton jetting around the world asking for money while his wife is president, it did not resolve a more pressing question: how her administration would handle longtime donors seeking help from the United States, or whose interests might conflict with the country’s own. The Clinton Foundation has accepted tens of millions of dollars from countries that the State Department  —   before, during and after Mrs. Clinton’s time as secretary  —   criticized for their records on sex discrimination and other   issues. The countries include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Brunei and Algeria. Saudi Arabia has been a particularly generous benefactor. The kingdom gave between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. (Donations are typically reported in broad ranges, not specific amounts.) At least $1 million more was donated by Friends of Saudi Arabia, which was   by a Saudi prince. Saudi Arabia also presents Washington with a complex diplomatic relationship full of strain. The kingdom is viewed as a bulwark to deter Iranian adventurism across the region and has been a partner in the fight against terrorism across the Persian Gulf and wider Middle East. At the same time, though, American officials have long worried about Saudi Arabia’s suspected role in promoting a   strain of Islam, which has some adherents who have been linked to violence. Saudi officials deny any links to terrorism groups, but critics point to Saudi charities that fund organizations suspected of ties to militant cells. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said the Clintons and the foundation had always been careful about donors. “The policies that governed the foundation’s activities during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state already went far beyond legal requirements,” he said in a statement, “and yet the foundation submitted to even more rigorous standards when Clinton declared her candidacy for president, and is pledging to go even further if she wins. ” Mrs. Clinton’s opponent, Donald J. Trump, could face his own complications if he becomes president, with investments abroad and hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate debt  —   financial positions that could be affected by moves he makes in the White House. And on Friday, Paul Manafort resigned as chairman of the Trump campaign, in part because of reports about his lucrative consulting work on behalf of   Ukrainian politicians. Still, Mr. Trump has seized on emails released over the past several weeks from Mrs. Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, in which a handful of donors are mentioned. He has attacked her over an email chain that showed Douglas J. Band, an adviser to Mr. Clinton, seeking to arrange a meeting between a senior American government official and Gilbert Chagoury, a   real estate developer who donated between $1 million and $5 million. Mr. Chagoury explained through a spokesman that he had simply wanted to provide insights on elections in Lebanon. Some emails and other records described donors seeking and in some cases obtaining meetings with State Department officials. None showed Mrs. Clinton making decisions in favor of any contributors, but her allies fear that additional emails might come out and provide more fodder for Mr. Trump. Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, said the decision to forgo corporate and foreign money had nothing to do with the emails. The foundation will continue to raise money from American individuals and charities. “The only factor is that we remove the perception problems, if she wins the presidency,” he said, “and make sure that programs can continue in some form for people who are being helped. ” But Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has sued to obtain records from Mrs. Clinton’s time at the State Department, said that “the damage is done. ” “The conflicts of interest are cast in stone, and it is something that the Clinton administration is going to have to grapple with,” Mr. Fitton said. “It will cast a shadow over their policies. ” And in an election year in which a majority of Americans say they do not trust Mrs. Clinton, even some allies questioned why the foundation had not reined in foreign donations sooner, or ended them immediately. A Bloomberg poll in June showed that 72 percent of voters said it bothered them either a lot or a little that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. In a   International Poll the same month, 38 percent of voters said Mr. Clinton should completely step down from the foundation, while 60 percent said he should be able to continue working with the foundation if his wife became president. Mr. Clinton said Thursday he would leave the foundation’s board if Mrs. Clinton won. Edward G. Rendell, a former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, said the foundation should be disbanded if Mrs. Clinton wins, and he added that it would make sense for the charity to stop taking foreign donations immediately. “I think they’ll do the right thing,” Mr. Rendell said, “and the right thing here is, without question, that the first gentleman have nothing to do with raising money for the foundation. ” Mr. Minassian said ending foreign   before other sources of money could be found, and without knowing who will win the election, could needlessly gut programs that help provide, for instance, H. I. V. medication to children in Africa. Begun in 1997, the foundation has raised roughly $2 billion and is overseen by a board that includes Mr. Clinton and the couple’s daughter, Chelsea. Mrs. Clinton joined when she left the State Department and stepped down in 2015 before beginning her campaign. Its work covers 180 countries, helping fund more than 3, 500 projects. Having a former president at the helm proved particularly productive, with foreign leaders and business people opening their doors  —   and their wallets  —   to the preternaturally sociable Mr. Clinton. Among the charity’s accomplishments: Its Clinton Health Access Initiative  —   which is run by Ira C. Magaziner, who was a White House aide involved in Mrs. Clinton’s failed effort to overhaul the health care system in her husband’s first term  —   renegotiated the cost of H. I. V. drugs to make them accessible to 11. 5 million people. The foundation helped bring healthier meals to more than 31, 000 schools in the United States, and it has helped 105, 000 farmers in East Africa increase their yields, according to the foundation’s tally. In December 2008, shortly before Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state, Mr. Clinton released a list of more than 200, 000 donors to defuse speculation about conflicts. Soon after, Mrs. Clinton agreed to keep foundation matters separate from official business, including a pledge to “not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect upon” the foundation without a waiver. The Obama White House had particularly disliked the gatherings of world leaders, academics and business people, called the Clinton Global Initiative, that the foundation was holding overseas. The foundation limited the conferences to domestic locations while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. On Thursday, Mr. Clinton said the gathering in September in New York would be the foundation’s last. One of the attendees at these conferences speaks to the stickiness of some donor relationships. Victor Pinchuk, a steel magnate whose    Leonid Kuchma, was president of Ukraine from 1994 to 2005, has directed between $10 million and $25 million to the foundation. He has lent his private plane to the Clintons and traveled to Los Angeles in 2011 to attend Mr. Clinton’s   65th birthday celebration. Between September 2011 and November 2012, Douglas E. Schoen, a former political consultant for Mr. Clinton, arranged about a dozen meetings with State Department officials on behalf of or with Mr. Pinchuk to discuss the continuing political crisis in Ukraine, according to reports Mr. Schoen filed as a registered lobbyist. “I had breakfast with Pinchuk. He will see you at the Brookings lunch,” Melanne Verveer, a   then working for the State Department, wrote in a June 2012 email to Mrs. Clinton. A previously undisclosed email obtained by Citizens United, the conservative advocacy group, through public records lawsuits shows the name of Mr. Pinchuk, described as one of Ukraine’s “most successful businessmen,” among those on an   list of influential people invited to a dinner party at the Clintons’ home. Earlier in 2012, Ambassador John F. Tefft wrote to Mrs. Clinton about a visit to Ukraine by Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, “at the invitation of oligarch, Victor Pinchuk. ” Mrs. Clinton replied, “As you know, hearing nice things about your children is as good as it gets. ” In July 2013, the Commerce Department began investigating complaints that Ukraine  —   and by extension Mr. Pinchuk’s company, Interpipe  —   and eight other countries had illegally dumped a type of steel tube on the American market at artificially low prices. A representative for Mr. Pinchuk said the investigation had nothing to do with the State Department, had started after Mrs. Clinton’s tenure and been suspended in July 2014. He added that at least 100 other people had attended the dinner party at Mrs. Clinton’s house and that she and Mr. Pinchuk had spoken briefly about democracy in Ukraine. A deal involving the sale of American uranium holdings to a Russian   enterprise was another example of the foundation intersecting with Mrs. Clinton’s official role in the Obama administration. Her State Department was among the agencies that signed off on the deal, which involved major Clinton charitable backers from Canada. There was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton had exerted influence over the deal, but the timing of the transaction and the donations raised questions about whether the donors had received favorable handling. Even if Mr. Clinton steps down, there could be remaining complications about a potential president’s name being affixed to an international foundation. And Chelsea Clinton, who is its vice chairwoman, would continue her leadership role. “It is very difficult to see how the organization called the Clinton Foundation can continue to exist during a Clinton presidency without that posing all sorts of consequences,” said John Wonderlich, the interim executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group in Washington. “What they announced only addresses the most egregious potential conflicts. ” Considering the scale and scope of the foundation, Mr. Wonderlich said it was easy to “name a hundred different types of conflicts. ” The reality is, he added, “there are no recusals when you are president. ”"
25192,Think Hillary Clinton Will Win in a Landslide? Don’t Bet on It - The New York Times,New York Times,Jeremy W. Peters and Giovanni Russonello,M,2016-08-26,2016.0,8.0,,"Donald J. Trump, after weeks of   damage, has seen support for his candidacy in national polls dip into the 30s  —   Barry Goldwater and Walter F. Mondale territory  —   while Hillary Clinton has extended her lead to double digits in several crucial swing states. Time to declare a landslide, right? Not so fast. The vote may be more favorable to Mr. Trump than the    prognosticators suggest for a very simple reason: Landslides do not really happen in presidential elections anymore. It has been 32 years since a president won the popular vote by a   percentage. That was when Mr. Mondale suffered an   defeat to Ronald Reagan in 1984. It was also the last time there was a landslide among states, with Mr. Mondale winning only Minnesota and the District of Columbia. There are a variety of factors that are likely to prevent a candidate today from rallying the huge,    majorities that swept Franklin D. Roosevelt back into office in 1936, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and Richard M. Nixon in 1972. The country is too fragmented and its political temperature too overheated for any single person to emerge as a consensus choice for anything nearing   of the electorate. And that climate has led the political parties to become far more ideologically uniform than they used to be. “The biggest difference between today and say, 1936 or 1964, is the composition of the two parties,” said Jonathan Darman, author of the book “Landslide: LBJ and Ronald Reagan at the Dawn of a New America. ” Party identification used to be more fluid, making it less difficult for partisan voters to conceive of supporting someone of the opposite affiliation. “The Republican and Democratic parties were much more heterogeneous than the parties we have today,” Mr. Darman added. “Party identification had a lot more to do with regional ties and family traditions than ideology. ” Data show just how less likely crossover voting is today. Ninety percent of Republicans and   of independents see Mrs. Clinton unfavorably, according to the most recent   poll. And many Trump defectors are choosing to vote for   candidates, which has also contributed to Mrs. Clinton’s inability to break the 50 percent threshold in most national polls. (All together, the   candidates are approaching 15 percent of the vote, indicating an unabated dissatisfaction with the nominees for the two major parties.) According to Amy Mitchell, director of journalism research at Pew Research Center, about 20 percent of voters now hold political beliefs that place them at the ideological poles of their respective parties  —   a number that doubled from 2004 to 2014. And these people tend to reinforce one another’s views. “Those on the ends of the political spectrum are more likely to surround themselves with people that think like they do,” Ms. Mitchell said. This high level of polarization could contribute to a curious electoral phenomenon, which could cost Mrs. Clinton support: If people begin to believe that she is going to run away with the election, they may lodge a protest vote against her simply to deny her a commanding victory. “If it becomes a ‘free vote,’ ” said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, “I think that could be one of her problems. If it looks all too easy and all too comfortable, there may be voters who will say, ‘I don’t want her to win by a landslide.’ ” If Mrs. Clinton performs well enough, she could achieve something her husband, Bill Clinton, never did: winning a majority of the popular vote. But given the polling today, the election is showing certain resemblances to the 1992 race that sent Mr. Clinton to the White House the first time. That year, many voters dissatisfied with President George Bush flocked to the independent Ross Perot, and neither Mr. Bush nor Bill Clinton came close to a majority. Mr. Clinton took a whopping 370 electoral votes, despite winning just 43 percent of the vote. With Mr. Perot on the ballot again in 1996, Mr. Clinton won only 49 percent. President Obama’s victory in his first term was considered about as large a landslide as possible given how split the country is. But when compared with the Johnson, Roosevelt and Reagan landslides, it was paltry: just 53 percent. Recent elections were more closely divided. George W. Bush received 48 percent in 2000  —   after he failed to win the popular vote but won the Electoral College  —   and 51 percent in 2004. The margin of victory, however, is about more than just bragging rights. If voter unease does not subside, a smaller victory could limit Mrs. Clinton’s ability to claim the kind of popular mandate that she and Democrats on Capitol Hill would like. “A mandate is some kind of issue platform that you have advocated that is the basis of your victory,” said Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. “Not fear of the person who got beaten, which I think is the prime motivator of the Clinton people: the fear of Trump. The same thing can be said for Trump voters: fear of Clinton. ” Absent a popular vote landslide, the only overwhelming chances for victory lie in the Electoral College. Mr. Obama won in 2008 with 365 electoral votes to Senator John McCain’s 173, for example. Mrs. Clinton could approach or even exceed that if Mr. Trump’s poll numbers remain depressed. But even so, for Mr. Trump not to carry close to 20 states would be a defeat on a huge scale. Mr. McCain won 22 states in 2008. And despite the scale of that defeat, it was still far less lopsided than Mr. Mondale’s one state and the District of Columbia."

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. How often do we get to start off with good news? The Census Bureau’s latest report showed that U. S. household income grew 5. 2 percent last year, the fastest rate since at least 1967. There were especially large declines in the poverty rates among   and Hispanic households. Many economists greeted the report with ebullience. The chairman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers tweeted that this was “unambiguously the best” such census data “ever. ” _____ 2. Hillary Clinton is recovering from pneumonia at her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. so President Obama campaigned for her. “We cannot afford suddenly to treat this like a reality show,” he told an enthusiastic crowd in Philadelphia. Mrs. Clinton’s illness highlighted the gap left by her campaign’s   strategy, leaving her team without a positive message to focus on in her absence. Donald Trump sought to seize campaign momentum, with appearances in Des Moines and, with his daughter Ivanka, in Philadelphia, where he will talk about maternity leave and child care. His running mate, Mike Pence, met with the Republican National Committee and some Republican leaders, but failed to persuade them to rally behind Mr. Trump. _____ 3. “I think people today feel disappointed, frustrated, ticked off or just plain sad, or a combination of all of the above. ” That was the head of a sports organization in North Carolina, a day after the N. C. A. A. pulled its championship events from the state over a law limiting the rights of gay and transgender people. Frustration was running particularly high among Republicans, and in areas that have supported L. G. B. T. rights, where people feel unfairly punished. _____ 4. Russian computer hackers published documents showing that three renowned U. S. athletes  —   Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Simone Biles  —   obtained medical exemptions to use banned drugs. The World   Agency, the source of the documents, denounced the effort to smear athletes who had received permission to use “a needed medication. ” The hackers, a group known as Tsar Team or Fancy Bear, said they would release records of athletes from around the world. Many Russians were barred from the Rio Olympics after a vast   doping program came to light. _____ 5. What a difference a film festival can make. Forecasts for the coming Oscars season shifted after several films received powerfully positive receptions in Toronto. The most buzz went to “Lion,” a film by Harvey Weinstein’s company based on the true story of a    Indian boy who steps on the wrong train and is separated from his family  —   and who, years later, sets out to find his parents. “Harvey’s baaack,” a longtime Academy Awards handicapper wrote on Twitter. _____ 6.   activists and health experts made a personal appeal to President Obama to ban menthol cigarettes. The flavoring, which makes it easier to start smoking and harder to quit, is embraced by four out of five black smokers. About 45, 000   die a year from   illnesses, and black men have the highest lung cancer mortality rate of any demographic group. _____ 7. The U. S. completed a $38 billion,   package of military aid for Israel, the largest of its kind ever, American officials said. The aid includes financing for missile defense systems that defend against rockets fired by groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, and phases out a provision allowing Israel to buy Israeli arms, instead channeling the money only to U. S.  military systems. Above, Israeli forces on drills. Shimon Peres, 93 and one of the last living founders of the modern state of Israel, suffered a serious stroke. _____ 8. A Syrian   appeared to be largely holding on its second day. But aid convoys idled, still waiting for word that routes into the besieged city of Aleppo were secure. The   part of a deal between the U. S. and Russia, calls for the two to share targeting information on Islamic State forces if the   holds for seven days. But skepticism of the unusual collaboration, which Secretary of State John Kerry brokered with his Russian counterpart, above, is running high within the U. S. military and the White House. _____ 9. What’s in the Kaaba, or cube, the black building that encloses the most sacred space in Islam? That was one of the questions readers sent to our correspondent who is on the annual hajj in Saudi Arabia. Very few people have been inside, she answered, but what’s interesting is how few objects are there. “Muslims are internalizing in every prayer that the one god they worship cannot be represented in an image and cannot be imagined, to the point where the house sanctified to God is empty,” she wrote. Watch a video of her experiences, above. _____ 10. Finally, while there’s been a run on a credit card with a $450 annual fee with a lavish rewards program, a professor of economics has pointed out that many of us don’t pinch our pennies in the right spots. He notes that consumers often waste money by chasing deals that offer a big percentage of savings  —   but in dollars and cents, not so much. Think about money in absolute terms, he urges: “After all, when your shopping is done, it is dollars  —   not percentages  —   that will be in your bank account. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

25315,"Elder Bush Plans to Vote for Hillary Clinton, a Kennedy Says - The New York Times",New York Times,Jonah Engel Bromwich,M,2016-09-21,2016.0,9.0,,"Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the eldest child of Robert F. Kennedy, said in a Facebook post on Monday that the elder President George Bush told her that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. The former president, however, is not talking. Ms. Townsend, 65, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland who on Facebook uses her middle name, Hartington, posted a picture of her shaking Mr. Bush’s hand. “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary! !” the caption said. Jim McGrath, a spokesman for the former president, 92, would neither confirm nor deny Ms. Townsend’s claim. “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,” Mr. McGrath said in an email. “He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. ” Ms. Townsend’s post was  reported on Monday by Politico. CNN posted a screen shot of the post, which did not appear to have been made public on Ms. Townsend’s Facebook page. Ms. Townsend told Politico that she had met with the former president in Maine earlier in the day. A report in The Texas Tribune in May, several months after Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, dropped out of the presidential race, quoted Mr. McGrath saying that the former president was not planning to make a public endorsement. “President Bush is retired from politics,” McGrath wrote in an email then. “He came out of retirement to do a few things for Jeb, but those were the exceptions that proved the rule. ” Former President George W. Bush, Mr. Bush’s oldest son, was also not planning on making a public endorsement, his aide Freddy Ford said at the time. Neither of the former presidents attended the Republican convention, though the younger Mr. Bush has campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates for Senate, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Many influential Republicans, including various members of both Bush administrations, have said they will not vote for the party’s nominee, Donald J. Trump. In June, Henry M. Paulson Jr. the Treasury secretary under George W. Bush, wrote an   article announcing that he would be casting a vote for Mrs. Clinton, making him one of several members of the last Republican presidential administration who have said they would be voting for the Democratic candidate."
25325,"Inside Hillary Clinton’s Outrage Machine, Allies Push the Buttons - The New York Times",New York Times,Jason Horowitz,M,2016-09-27,2016.0,9.0,,"Just before 9:30 p. m. on Sept. 13, the first Twitter post appeared, directing users to an obscure article about a remark Donald J. Trump had made last year that 50 percent of the country did not want to work. Over the next 48 hours, 1, 819 people, seemingly furious that the news media had paid more attention to Hillary Clinton’s assertion that half of Trump supporters fit into a “basket of deplorables,” lashed out at reporters and news outlets. “Dear Media: If you don’t cover this, you’re covering for him, #Trump50percent,” wrote one Twitter user. “@CNN @CNNPolitics have been in bed with #Trump for a year! They refuse to report #TrumpScandals #Trump50percent” wrote another. By the end of the week, the hashtag #Trump50percent had appeared in Twitter timelines more than 30, 000 times. Other liberal Twitter users, some of them with more than a million followers, linked to the article and spread the same complaint the Clinton campaign had made: that a shameful false equivalence was causing the media to   Mr. Trump’s many transgressions and overplay the few it could find on Mrs. Clinton. At first glance, the Clintonian grass roots seemed to have organically sprouted in anger. But closer inspection yielded traces of   that led to the sixth floor of a building in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan. There, surrounded by   tech companies, “Star Wars” posters and   televisions fixed on cable news, Peter Daou sat with his team at a long wooden table last week, pushing the buttons that activate Mrs. Clinton’s outrage machine. Mr. Daou’s operation, called Shareblue, had published the article on Mr. Trump’s comment on its website and created the accompanying hashtag. “They will put that pressure right on the media outlets in a very intense way,” Mr. Daou, the chief executive of Shareblue, said of the Twitter army he had galvanized. “By the thousands. ” In the sprawling Clinton body politic, Shareblue is the finger that wags at the mainstream news media (“R. I. P. Political Journalism ( )”) or pokes at individual reporters. It is a minor appendage, but in an increasingly close race for the presidency, it plays its part. And it is already warming up for the biggest event of the general election so far: the first debate, on Monday night. It has already published a piece calling on moderators to   Mr. Trump on the spot, and will continue through debate night, whipping up support online with the hashtag #DemandFairDebates. Shareblue is owned by David Brock, the onetime Clinton critic who remade himself into a Clinton supporter and architect of a conglomerate of organizations designed, he said, to be the liberal answer to the conservative messaging of Fox News. The Brock network includes his Media Matters for America watchdog website two   “super PACs,” the opposition research outfit American Bridge and the     and   operation Correct the Record and Shareblue, which filled the need, Mr. Brock said, for a progressive outlet that spoke directly to the grass roots and which “was avidly and unabashedly  . ” Shareblue’s    content is exposing what it considers to be news coverage stacked against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Daou was particularly excited about a project seeking to show that Mrs. Clinton’s email travails had been in the news every day since the story originally broke in March 2015. Often, their editorial direction seems in sync with the Clinton campaign, which has instructed its surrogates to blame news coverage for negative press. “Are they going to hold Hillary to a different standard again?” read one recent “talking points” memo sent by the campaign to its surrogates. That approach became clear this month. On Sept. 1, The Washington Post broke a story about the Donald J. Trump Foundation being fined for improperly donating $25, 000 to Pam Bondi, the attorney general of Florida, around the time that her office was deciding whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. The next day, the Clinton campaign put out a statement contending that while the news media had an unhealthy obsession with the Clinton Foundation, Mr. Trump’s charity had been caught in an “actual    scandal. ” The Clinton campaign’s foreign policy spokesman, Jesse Lehrich, wrote on Twitter: “Awaiting outrage. ” He didn’t have to wait long. Mr. Daou and his website incessantly demanded coverage of the Trump Foundation story. “We just have to start the fire,” Mr. Daou said in an interview last week. Many liberal columnists, Democratic operatives and members of the Media Matters family reached the same conclusion, excoriating news outlets and individuals for grading Mr. Trump “on a curve. ” Whether it truly cleared the air about Mr. Trump’s foundation or merely muddied the water about Mrs. Clinton’s, Mr. Daou took credit for injecting the notion of false equivalence into the social media bloodstream and for forcing some news outlets to adjust their coverage. “  people are now talking about the double standard in coverage,” Mr. Daou said. “We feel we were way ahead of the curve. ” Mr. Brock recruited Mr. Daou to join what was then called Blue Nation Review (it relaunched as Shareblue this month) during a breakfast at the Regency Hotel in New York in November. Mr. Daou grew up in Lebanon and spent the ’90s working in dance music with his first wife as part of a group called The Daou, which put the words of his aunt, the novelist Erica Jong, to music. He then worked as a producer and keyboardist for Björk and other musicians. In the 2000s, Mr. Daou broke into progressive blogging and claimed to have helped found The Huffington Post. His suit accusing the company of denying him appropriate credit and compensation was settled in 2014. He also worked directly in politics, first for John Kerry in 2004 and then for Mrs. Clinton in 2008, leading her digital operation. Beyond creating a boisterous echo chamber, the real metric of success for Shareblue, which Mr. Brock said has a budget of $2 million supplied by his political donors, is getting Mrs. Clinton elected. Mr. Daou’s role is deploying a band of committed, outraged followers to harangue Mrs. Clinton’s opponents. “The pond scum of American politics,” is how Tad Devine, a senior strategist to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, described the website in March for its frequent attacks on Mr. Sanders. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, viewed Shareblue more as a necessary voice in a world teeming with conservative radio, television and internet outlets that fire up the Republican base. “On the left, frankly, having more of that is not a bad thing,” Mr. Merrill said. Of Mr. Daou, he added, “He has a great sense of what’s moving around and where in the depths of the Twittersphere. ” Just how much Mr. Daou coordinates his efforts with the Clinton campaign is hard to pinpoint. The campaign said there was no formal coordination with Shareblue, and Mr. Daou said he did not take any direction from the campaign. “Now do I communicate with them regularly? I do,” Mr. Daou said, noting that because of his years working for Mrs. Clinton, “half the people on that campaign, if not more, are former colleagues and friends. ” He added that when one of their stories takes off, “I’ll let them know, ‘Hey check out what we just posted, it looks like a good angle. ’” Mr. Brock said his Correct the Record PAC talked to the Clinton campaign. But as for his Shareblue operation, he said: “There are people in the campaign who are aware of what we are doing and who have been encouraging about what we are doing. I wouldn’t go further than that. ” While Mr. Daou, the pianist, can accompany the larger Clinton ensemble, he can also step forward as a soloist when need be. When video of Mrs. Clinton falling ill on Sept. 11 exploded in the news media, the campaign, which had at first said she overheated, apologized for not revealing her diagnosis of pneumonia beforehand. Correct the Record went virtually dark. “It was waiting for guidance from the campaign,” Mr. Brock explained. But Mr. Daou quickly started defending Mrs. Clinton from critics on Twitter (“They should be ashamed”) and that evening posted an article on Shareblue about Mrs. Clinton’s grit, headlined “Hillary Clinton’s feat of strength obliterates months of health conspiracies. ” It was roundly mocked as a blatant example of   spin. But two days later, the Clinton campaign distributed another memo of talking points to its surrogates using her near collapse as an opportunity to talk about her stamina. “To anyone who knows Hillary,” read the first bullet point, “it does not come as much of a surprise that even when she’s under the weather, she would want to power through her normal schedule. ”"
25349,"In Hacked Audio, Hillary Clinton Rethinks Obama’s Nuclear Upgrade Plan - The New York Times",New York Times,David E. Sanger and William J. Broad,M,2016-09-30,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Hillary Clinton expressed doubts about whether the United States should go forward with a   modernization of its nuclear forces at a   in February, questioning an Obama administration plan that she has remained largely silent on in public. Mrs. Clinton also suggested she would be far tougher against foreign nations that hack into American computer networks and would kill one of the Pentagon’s pet projects, a   cruise missile. “The last thing we need,” she told the audience, “are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear armed. ” Her comments were contained in an audio recording of the   that appeared on the website of The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, which said it was gleaned from the hack of a campaign staff member. But it said nothing about who did the hacking. At a moment when Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration have warned that Russia is trying to influence the American election, the mysterious release of the tape is also certain to raise new questions about the scope of attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. A former Defense Department official present at the   Andrew C. Weber, who raised the question about nuclear modernization, verified the contents of the tape, but also suggested its release was part of the same hacking campaign that exposed D. N. C. emails. Before she turned to nuclear matters, Mrs. Clinton used the   to suggest that she would be much firmer against foreign nations that hack into American networks. Though the administration never formally accused China of stealing the   records of nearly 22 million federal employees and contractors, she called the theft “a gold mine for Chinese intelligence. ” “They are at it all the time,” she said of the Chinese   hackers. But she also seemed to suggest  —   more directly than she did in Monday night’s debate  —   that she thinks the best deterrent to the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and the North Koreans, all of whom she named, was a dose of American offensive cyberweaponry. “They have physical assets that are also connected on the internet,” she said. “So they have to know we would retaliate. So that provides a certain level of deterrence. ” It may not: The   hacks of the Democrats’ infrastructure, so far without a visible American response, suggest that the deterrence Mrs. Clinton is relying on is not working. The   recording was made in February during a   event at the home of Beatrice and Anthony Welters in McLean, Va. Mrs. Welters was ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Mr. Weber was an assistant secretary of defense for nuclear programs from 2009 to 2014. Last year, after leaving office, he joined William J. Perry, a secretary of defense in the administration of President Bill Clinton and one of the Democratic Party’s most influential nuclear advisers, to write an   in The Washington Post strongly opposing White House approval of an upgraded nuclear cruise missile. The missile is part of a sweeping modernization of the American nuclear arsenal that is estimated to cost up to $1 trillion over three decades. Undertaken by the Obama administration, it features new factories, refurbished nuclear arms, and a new generation of weapon carriers, including bombers, missiles and submarines. The new bombers are to carry the new cruise missile. At the   Mr. Weber asked Mrs. Clinton about the modernization push and whether she, as president, would cancel the cruise missile, which he called a “particularly destabilizing, dangerous type of nuclear weapon. ” “I certainly would be inclined to do that,” she answered. “The last thing we need are sophisticated cruise missiles that are  . ” Mrs. Clinton went beyond the question to warn of an emerging nuclear arms race, naming Russia and China as well as Pakistan and India. “This is one of the most dangerous developments imaginable,” she told the audience. “Pakistan is running full speed to develop tactical nukes in their continuing hostility with India. ” she said. “But we live in fear that they’re going to have a coup, that jihadists are going to take over the government, they’re going to get access to nuclear weapons, and you’ll have suicide nuclear bombers. So, this could not be a more threatening scenario. ” The United States, Mrs. Clinton said, needs to “do everything we can” to restrain the competitions, including exploring new treaties with Moscow that would go beyond the New Start treaty of 2010, which she helped negotiate. Mrs. Clinton proceeded to praise Mr. Perry, saying the more he spoke out publicly and joined with Republican statesmen in trying to curb nuclear arms, “the better off we’ll be in trying to really cut this off.’ “This is going to be a big issue,” she added. “It’s not just the   cruise missile. There’s a lot of other money we’re taking about to go into refurbishing and modernization. ” “Do we have to do any of it?” Mrs. Clinton asked. “If we have to do some of it, how much do we have to do? That’s going to be a tough question, so I will look to people like you and Bill Perry to help me answer that question. ” Mr. Obama has said he wants to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American strategy, and his aides have hinted he may believe the modernization program needs reconsideration. But he seems to have left that to his successor, and the cruise missile Mrs. Clinton spoke about so disparagingly remains in the Pentagon budget."
25751,Hillary Clinton Says Donald Trump Is Not Qualified to Be President - The New York Times,New York Times,Amy Chozick,F,2016-05-19,2016.0,5.0,,"Hillary Clinton declared herself the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee on Thursday and, looking to the fall election, said that her likely Republican rival, Donald J. Trump, was not qualified to be president. Asked by CNN’s Chris Cuomo whether Mr. Trump was qualified to hold the office they both seek, Mrs. Clinton declared emphatically, “No. ” She called the crash of an EgyptAir flight early Thursday an act of terrorism and went on to portray Mr. Trump as dangerously out of step with what a commander in chief would need to do to combat such attacks. She cited his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering American borders, his comments about diminishing the United States’ involvement in NATO and his remarks that he would negotiate directly with the North Korean dictator, Kim   as evidence of how “unmoored” Mr. Trump is on foreign policy. This month, when MSNBC asked a similar question, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump had “given no indication that he understood the gravity of the responsibilities that go with being commander in chief. ” But she stopped short of emphatically declaring that he was unqualified. She did not mince words on Thursday, saying, “I have concluded he is not qualified to be president of the United States. ” In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton was the candidate unqualified to president. “She has bad judgment,” Mr. Trump said in the statement, “and is unfit to serve as president at this delicate and difficult time in our country’s history. ” Mrs. Clinton’s statements come as she encounters a lingering threat for the Democratic nomination from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose supporters have become increasingly antagonistic toward her candidacy. Despite recent primary wins by Mr. Sanders, his path to the party’s nomination appears mathematically impossible, a fact Mrs. Clinton sought to make abundantly clear. “I will be the nominee of our party, Chris,” she told Mr. Cuomo. “There is no way I won’t be. ” On Thursday afternoon, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said in a statement that his candidate’s recent victories in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon showed that voters there “respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton. ” He added, “We expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree,” and said that some polls showing Mr. Sanders faring better than Mrs. Clinton against Mr. Trump made it “clear that millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign. ” Throughout the interview, Mrs. Clinton appeared ready to put the primaries behind her and move on to Mr. Trump. Asked if she would consider naming Mr. Sanders her   nominee, in an effort to unify the party and bring in his liberal and young supporters, she demurred. “I think the thing that brings us together is Donald Trump,” she said. She declined to respond to Mr. Trump’s attacks on her husband, Bill Clinton, including an interview with Fox News on Wednesday night in which Mr. Trump brought up a   rape allegation against the former president. “I think people can judge his campaign for what it is,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I’m going to run my campaign. ” Asked if she had the urge to defend her family’s honor against the onslaught of attacks that will grow louder, Mrs. Clinton said: “No, not at all. I know that is exactly what he is fishing for, and I’m not going to be responding. ” The interview took place in Park Ridge, Ill. the Chicago suburb where Mrs. Clinton spent her childhood. Mr. Cuomo asked what advice her mother, Dorothy Rodham, would have given her in dealing with the likely battle that awaits her against an opponent unlike any she has confronted. “I think it would be the same advice that my mother always gave me,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Which is everybody gets knocked down and knocked around in life. The real test is whether you get up and keep going. ”"
25765,Bernie Sanders Vows Fight to Convention as Hillary Clinton Wins a Primary - The New York Times,New York Times,Yamiche Alcindor,F,2016-06-06,2016.0,6.0,,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif.  —   Senator Bernie Sanders defiantly vowed again on Sunday to take his campaign to the Democratic National Convention this summer, even as Hillary Clinton edged closer to clinching the party’s presidential nomination and the final primary contests drew near. Two days before Tuesday’s primaries in California and five other states, Mr. Sanders repeated his pledge not to concede even if Mrs. Clinton acquires enough delegates to reach 2, 383, the threshold for securing the nomination. A win in California is critical to Mr. Sanders’s plan to stay in the race through the convention and would give him a significant lift. But with her victory in the Puerto Rico primary on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton is only 28 delegates short of the threshold and will most likely declare victory on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders, however, insists that the convention will be contested because he is still lobbying superdelegates  —   party officials and state leaders who cast their final votes at the convention  —   to withdraw support from Mrs. Clinton and back him instead. He plans to make the case that he is a stronger candidate against Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. A number of polls, he said, show he can beat Mr. Trump by larger margins than Mrs. Clinton can. On Sunday, Mr. Sanders opened a new line of attack against Mrs. Clinton, criticizing donations made by foreign governments while she was secretary of state to the Clinton Foundation, the organization founded by former President Bill Clinton. When Mr. Sanders, who greeted fans in West Hollywood, was asked by reporters if he remained committed to pushing for a contested convention, he said he “absolutely” was. A convention is typically seen as contested when a candidate cannot reach the necessary delegate count using both pledged delegates and superdelegates. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton conceded to Barack Obama shortly after the final primary and before the convention. But Mr. Sanders is promising to break with tradition and extend his fight further than initially expected. Mr. Sanders reiterated his stance on Sunday at a restaurant filled with disco lights as he urged supporters to back him. “We need a real change in this country,” Mr. Sanders said to a cheering crowd at the restaurant, Hamburger Mary’s, in West Hollywood, “and we need a government which represents all of us, not just the 1 percent. ” During a news conference on Saturday in Los Angeles, Mr. Sanders said it would be wrong for Mrs. Clinton to claim victory on Tuesday based on her total delegate count. News media outlets should not call the race, he said, unless she reaches the threshold with only pledged delegates. “It is extremely unlikely that Secretary Clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night,” Mr. Sanders said. “Now, I have heard reports that Secretary Clinton has said it’s all going to be over on Tuesday night. I have reports that the media, after the New Jersey results come in, are going to declare that it is all over. That simply is not accurate. ” Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders in both pledged and total delegates. In a sign of his campaign’s urgency to win in California, Mr. Sanders criticized the Clinton Foundation during an interview on Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union. ” “If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, governments which are dictatorships?” Mr. Sanders said. “You don’t have a lot of civil liberties or democratic rights in Saudi Arabia,” he told the interviewer, Jake Tapper. “You don’t have a lot of respect there for opposition points of view for gay rights, for women’s rights. Yes, do I have a problem with that? Yes, I do. ” Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton spent Sunday campaigning in California, where polls indicated a tight race. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Clinton visited black churches, appealing to a demographic that had given her important support in past nominating contests. In Oakland, Mrs. Clinton spoke at Greater St. Paul Church. Tailoring her remarks to her audience, she recalled working briefly in Oakland in the 1970s, and she praised the Golden State Warriors, who were set to host Game 2 of the N. B. A. finals. Mrs. Clinton also talked about issues like gentrification and gun violence and told congregants how difficult it was to be president. “I wish it was only about making speeches,” Mrs. Clinton said. “You know, just get up there and promise the moon and make all of these rhetorical flourishes. That’d be a lot easier than what the job is. ” Mr. Clinton visited First African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Los Angeles, where he took aim at Mr. Trump and addressed criticism that he and his wife were part of the “political establishment. ” “This is not an establishment campaign,” he said. “This is an inclusion campaign. ” Mr. Sanders spent much of his day walking around greeting voters in several places, including the Santa Monica Pier, where dozens of fans hugged and snapped photos with him. Some shouted, “That’s our next president!” But there were signs of opposition from Clinton supporters. One woman shouted, “Get out of the race!” As Mr. Sanders shook hands, he quickly moved past Jenny Swiatowy, 33, who sat next to a fruit arrangement with a sticker showing her support for Mrs. Clinton. “In the beginning, I thought it was great for him to come out as a new candidate with a new voice and to start bringing out the young new voters,” said Ms. Swiatowy, who works at a record label. “But it’s time to concede and unite the party. ” Mr. Sanders, though, was not bowing to the pressure. “See you in Philly,” he told one smiling supporter."
25768,Bernie Sanders’s Supporters Fume Over Hillary Clinton’s New Label - The New York Times,New York Times,Alan Rappeport,M,2016-06-08,2016.0,6.0,,"Passionate supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders awoke enraged on Tuesday after learning that his slim hopes for winning the Democratic presidential nomination had been effectively dashed as a batch of superdelegates revealed their support for Hillary Clinton. After months of dancing around the phrase, news organizations on Monday night finally bestowed a   label on Mrs. Clinton: presumptive nominee. The Sanders campaign immediately assailed the media for rushing the process and undermining the will of voters who were set to head to the polls in six states on Tuesday. In a     email, Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, urged voters to defy the pundits and deliver a stunning series of victories for the Vermont senator. “We should let the voters decide who they want the Democratic nominee to be rather than having the media decide for them,” Mr. Weaver wrote. “I am asking you to continue to stand with Bernie in pushing for the political revolution. ” On social media, supporters of Mr. Sanders fumed at a system that they have increasingly felt is rigged against their candidate. Irate messages poured onto the “Sanders for President” message board on Reddit, an online discussion forum, with users promising to vote for Mr. Sanders regardless of what the superdelegates said. Some said they would vote for Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and others suggested that Mr. Sanders join the Green Party and keep running against Mrs. Clinton. But the momentum that now favors Mrs. Clinton may be too much. The term “presumptive nominee” has no formal definition in politics. Yet traditionally when it is used to describe a candidate, a wave of endorsements carries that person to the nomination. Once The Associated Press, which prodded the superdelegates to come forward, declared Mrs. Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee, the phrase soon reverberated across news outlets around the world. “There’s a bandwagon effect,” Douglas G. Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University, said of being billed as a presumptive nominee. “Everybody starts coalescing around that candidate. ” The A. P. said it uses the term when it becomes clear a candidate for president will be formally nominated at a party’s convention. Television networks, newspapers and online media quickly followed The A. P.’s lead once it was determined that Mrs. Clinton had reached the 2, 383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Mr. Sanders and his campaign were clearly fearful that Mrs. Clinton would be called the presumptive nominee while primary voting was still going on, particularly with Tuesday’s contest in California, where polls have shown the two candidates to be close. But both candidates could be now exposed by The A. P.’s early call, which could dampen turnout among voters who think the race is over. Mrs. Clinton noted the importance of crossing the delegate threshold on Monday night, but avoided marking the moment as conclusive. If her voters stay home on Tuesday, a series of defeats would be an embarrassment and could buttress Mr. Sanders’s argument for why he should continue campaigning until the Democratic convention in July. Although the media was quick to give the designation to Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic Party did not. The Democratic National Committee has no official definition for the term “presumptive nominee. ” Mark Paustenbach, a spokesman for the committee, would not say if or when the D. N. C. would begin using “presumptive” to describe Mrs. Clinton. On the Republican side, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, declared Donald J. Trump the presumptive nominee after he won the Indiana primary last month. For the time being, Mr. Sanders is still making arguments for why superdelegates should ditch his opponent and make him the nominee. Polls that show him performing better against Mr. Trump than Mrs. Clinton, and his energized   following, form the crux of his appeal. Mrs. Clinton, who eight years ago dropped her presidential bid and supported Barack Obama, can likely relate to the plight of Mr. Sanders despite her desire to focus on the general election. In 2008, Mr. Obama captured a majority of pledged delegates in May, but declined to declare victory. Mrs. Clinton insisted that the contest was not finished and argued that neither candidate would have enough delegates for the nomination. “This is nowhere near over,” Mrs. Clinton said at the time. The race went on for only two more weeks."

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Congressional Republicans, infuriated by the F. B. I. ’s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton, summoned the bureau’s director, James Comey, to hearings on Thursday. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she accepted the bureau’s recommendation, ending the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said Mrs. Clinton’s use of private email servers as secretary of state showed that she could not be trusted with classified material. But some Republicans fretted that Donald Trump and his small campaign organization were not capitalizing on Mr. Comey’s harsh criticism of Mrs. Clinton. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton tried to redirect attention, disparaging Mr. Trump’s business practices at a stop in Atlantic City. “He always rigged it so he got paid no matter how his companies performed,” she said in front of one of his failed casinos. At a separate event in North Carolina, she responded to the leftward pressure exerted by Bernie Sanders’s campaign, announcing plans to eliminate college tuition at   public colleges and universities for families with annual incomes under $125, 000. _____ 3. “Donald Trump is not   and he’s not a racist. ” That’s Jared Kushner, his    and the publisher of The Observer, declaring that Mr. Trump should not be held responsible for the views of fringe followers who barrage some Jewish reporters with   comments. In a lengthy   Mr. Kushner disclosed how his family members suffered and died in the Holocaust. He said terms like “ ” were “being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless. ” On Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump delivered a speech that seemed to clash with Mr. Kushner’s   defending a broadly criticized image posted to his Twitter account that showed a picture of Hillary Clinton next to a   star. _____ 4. Gretchen Carlson, the longtime Fox News anchor, stunned the TV industry with a lawsuit accusing the network’s chairman, Roger Ailes, of firing her after she refused his sexual advances. The suit says Mr. Ailes propositioned Ms. Carlson in response to her complaints of rife sexual harassment in the workplace. It says he responded to her rejection by cutting her salary and airtime, and then declining to renew her contract. _____ 5. The Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into a fatal police shooting in Baton Rouge, La. A video of the episode shows that two officers had a black man, Alton Sterling, 37, pinned to the ground before opening fire. Louisiana’s governor, John Bel Edwards, pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, acknowledging, “The video is disturbing, to say the least. ” _____ 6. Hoverboards don’t hover, but the Consumer Product Safety Commission says they do combust. The agency recalled more than a   of the     scooters, saying they had caused at least 60 fires and were responsible for at least $2 million in property damage. _____ 7. At war with clutter? Reinforcements are near. Marie Kondo, the Japanese organizer whose lodestar is joy, has an army of proselytizers in training to bring her “  Magic of Tidying Up” to a wider audience. One acolyte is taking her system a step further: raising the bar to letting stuff in the house in the first place. _____ 8. Oscar Pistorius was resentenced for fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, this time drawing six years in prison. A higher court had sent back his initial   sentence for manslaughter, saying the disabled South African runner should be sentenced for murder. The judge explained her rejection of prosecutors’ request for at least 15 years: “He’s a fallen hero who has lost his career and is ruined financially. “The worst is that having taken the life of a fellow human being in the manner that he did, he cannot be at peace. ” _____ 9. Britain got its moment of reckoning for the Iraq war. An independent panel’s findings excoriated former Prime Minister Tony Blair for blindly accepting flawed U. S. intelligence and promising George W. Bush loyalty. Mr. Blair responded with a nearly   news conference in which he acknowledged profound mistakes but pleaded for understanding. After the   terrorist attacks on the U. S. he said, “We were in a new world. ” _____ 10.  The other war the U. S. entered after the   attacks grinds on. President Obama slowed his already delayed drawdown of troops from Afghanistan, saying, “The security situation remains precarious. ” He plans to leave 8, 400 troops there, handing his successor a military commitment he had intended to end before he left office. _____ 11. Finally, two French entrepreneurs are trying to change the way Parisians view immigrants. They recruited chefs from Syria, Chechnya, Iran, India, Sri Lanka and, above left, Ethiopia, and have catered 20 events since February, including lunches, dinners and buffets. “The cuisine of a place gives pleasure,” said one of the businessmen. “This is part of immigration, too. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

25865,A ‘Short-Circuit’ on F.B.I. Inquiry? Hillary Clinton Seeks to Explain - The New York Times,New York Times,Yamiche Alcindor and Amy Chozick,F,2016-08-10,2016.0,8.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Hillary Clinton on Friday sought to explain her recent mischaracterization of the F. B. I. investigation into her private email server, saying she “may have  ” in her remarks during a television interview on Sunday when she asserted that the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, had called her statements about her private email servers “truthful. ” Mrs. Clinton made the remarks while taking her most extensive questions from journalists in months  —   after going more than 200 days without holding a formal news conference. She has been under fire from Republicans and others since her remarks Sunday on Fox News about her use of a private email server as secretary of state and the resulting F. B. I. investigation. While Mr. Comey did not recommend charges in the case, he said Mrs. Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her use of a private email server and contradicted statements she made about her handling of her email. In her remarks here before the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Mrs. Clinton tried to explain the discrepancy with what Mr. Comey actually said. “I was pointing out in both of those instances that Director Comey had said that my answers in my F. B. I. interview were truthful,” she said. “That’s really the bottom line here. ” Mrs. Clinton reiterated her explanation that the classified emails the F. B. I. had identified as having passed over her private server were not marked classified at the time. The explanation did not appease Republicans. “It’s not hard to see why she hasn’t held a press conference in 244 days,” said the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus. “Hillary Clinton is once again proving herself incapable of telling the truth. ” During her remarks, Mrs. Clinton said she took “seriously” the problems she has had winning voters’ trust. Questioned about why a majority of voters do not trust her, Mrs. Clinton referred to her high approval ratings when she was secretary of state and a senator from New York. “Were 67 percent of the people in New York wrong? Were 66 percent of the American public wrong?” she asked. “Just maybe, when I’m actually running for a job, there is a real benefit to those on the other side with trying to stir up as much trouble as possible. ” And she explained that the economic frustration driving many of Donald J. Trump’s supporters should be taken seriously. When asked about what Mr. Trump’s millions of supporters, who are often drawn to language she and others have called racist and sexist, says about the electorate, Mrs. Clinton said that while some people were backing the businessman because of his “bigotry,” she acknowledged that many were motivated by economic hardships. “We have to recognize that of course some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and misogynistic and offensive,” she said. “We have to acknowledge that  —   but let’s not lose sight of the real pain that many of Americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind. ” Mrs. Clinton also criticized Mr. Trump on Friday as someone who would be a dangerous president and stressed that if elected, she would work on issues related to systemic racism and the economy that often hit black and Hispanic communities the hardest. “He is harkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society,” she said. “We need to stand up as a country and say that Donald Trump doesn’t represent who we are and what we believe. ” Mrs. Clinton also vowed to push hard to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill with a path toward citizenship for those in the country illegally, and said she would prioritize the issue during her first 100 days in office. Mrs. Clinton joins a long list of political leaders who have spoken at the groups’ conventions, which often focus on increasing diversity in newsrooms. President Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former president George W. Bush, Bob Dole and former Vice President Al Gore have all addressed past conventions. The groups invited Mr. Trump to speak, but he declined, according to the organizers. Before taking questions, Mrs. Clinton delivered a   address focused mostly on how her plans to improve the economy would especially benefit blacks and Latinos. “Rosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus,” she said. “Now we’ve got to open up every opportunity. ” Hovering over the address was the image of Mrs. Clinton addressing a room full of journalists. Although she occasionally holds informal sessions with the news media on campaign stops, Clinton aides have spent months explaining why she hasn’t held an official news conference, as most candidates, particularly Mr. Trump, do regularly. “We’ll have a press conference when we want to have a press conference,” Joel Benenson, the campaign’s chief strategist and pollster, told ABC News last month. She even had some words of encouragement for the Fourth Estate: “We need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable,” Mrs. Clinton told the hundreds of journalists attending the   conference here of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Near the end of the event, Mrs. Clinton talked about her   girlfriends, whom she rarely mentions in public. Asked what the most meaningful conversation she has had with one of them, she said she was “blessed to have a crew of great friends. ” These include some of her most senior aides, including Cheryl D. Mills, Maggie Williams and Minyon Moore. “I can’t compress it into one conversation,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They’ve supported me. They’ve chastised me. They’ve raised issues with me. ”"
25869,Tim Kaine Says Hillary Clinton Has Learned From Email ‘Mistake’ - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy,M,2016-08-08,2016.0,8.0,,"Hillary Clinton will be “real transparent” with Americans after learning lessons from the controversy over her use of a private email server, her running mate, Tim Kaine, said on Sunday, expressing optimism that she could improve her trust deficit with voters over the next month. Appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mr. Kaine also said Mrs. Clinton and President Obama would together decide how to proceed with Mr. Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court, if she won the presidency in November. Mr. Kaine’s primary objective on NBC was to help Mrs. Clinton move on from her latest email imbroglio: her inaccurate statement last week that the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, had called her answers about her private email server “truthful. ” Mr. Comey told Congress last month that he could not say if Mrs. Clinton had lied to Americans about her email practices, also saying the F. B. I. had “no basis to conclude she lied to the F. B. I. ” While Mrs. Clinton said on Friday that she “may have  ” by suggesting that Mr. Comey had unconditionally vouched for her, Mr. Kaine focused on Mrs. Clinton’s admission that her use of the private server had been a “mistake”  —   a word he repeated four times  —   and said she had apologized for the matter. “I know that this is something that she’s learned from, and we’re going to be real transparent, absolutely,” Mr. Kaine said. Mrs. Clinton made her first apologies roughly a year ago and has promised to be more open, yet she was criticized for going more than 200 days without holding a formal news conference until Friday, when she took questions from reporters in Washington. Mr. Kaine suggested that more voters might trust Mrs. Clinton “even a month from now,” reflecting an ABC   Post poll on Sunday in which Mrs. Clinton held an edge in trustworthiness over Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee. Asked which candidate was more honest and trustworthy, 49 percent of respondents chose Mrs. Clinton and 40 percent chose Mr. Trump, while the margin was narrower  —   46 percent to 43 percent  —   among registered voters. Both results were Mrs. Clinton’s best against Mr. Trump since the poll started asking the question in May, according to a news release accompanying the poll. Mrs. Clinton holds a lead of eight percentage points among registered voters over all, according to the poll, and has improved markedly with   white women  —   a group that Democrats have struggled to win for decades. But she continued to fare poorly among white men without college degrees. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, on Sunday played down the troubles that Mr. Trump has caused for himself recently with comments at his rallies and interviews, including his attacks on a Gold Star family and his surprising decision to withhold endorsements from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator John McCain for several days last week. Mr. Manafort said on Fox’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that the general election was just starting and that Mr. Trump would focus on attacking Mrs. Clinton starting on Monday with an economic speech in Detroit. “The campaign is a   campaign  —   we’re at the beginning,” Mr. Manafort said. “Starting Monday, we’re going to be announcing our economic plan. When we do that, we’re comfortable that we can get the agenda and the narrative of the campaign back on where it belongs, which is comparing the tepid economy under Obama and Clinton versus the kind of growth economy that Mr. Trump wants to build. ” Perhaps Mr. Kaine’s most surprising comments were about the fate of Judge Garland. He and Mrs. Clinton strongly support Judge Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court, but the judge’s future remains unclear in the   Senate. If the Senate does not act on Judge Garland, and Mrs. Clinton becomes president in January, she would have to decide whether to stick with the choice of Mr. Obama, her close ally, or to pick someone else for the vacancy. Mr. Kaine, who represents Virginia in the Senate, said the fate of Judge Garland “will be for the president and the   to decide,” adding that it was up to Republicans in control of the Senate to bring the nomination to a vote. Asked if it was a 100 percent certainty that Mrs. Clinton would stick with Judge Garland’s nomination if she were elected, Mr. Kaine sidestepped the question and said that the onus was on Republicans to hold a vote and that he would vote in favor of the nomination. On Syria, Mr. Kaine said he believed the Obama administration had sent “a mixed message” about whether President Bashar   had to be deposed after crossing Mr. Obama’s   red line forbidding Syria to use chemical weapons. Still, Mr. Kaine said he supported the administration’s decision not to focus on ousting or replacing Mr. Assad and instead to concentrate on battling the Islamic State in Syria and elsewhere. On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination and has refused to endorse him, ruled out voting for Mrs. Clinton in November, as some Republicans have said they would do. But asked if he would vote for Mr. Trump, Mr. Kasich said, “I wish that I could be fully enthusiastic  —   I can’t be  —   so I don’t know what’s going to happen in the end. ” He also said he did not know if Mr. Trump could win Ohio in November  —   a key state in his electoral strategy  —   if Mr. Trump continued to make controversial comments. “I still think it’s difficult if you are dividing to be able to win in Ohio,” he said. “I think it’s really, really difficult. ” Mr. Kasich also confirmed a recent report in The New York Times Magazine that one of his aides had received a phone call from the Trump campaign to offer the   slot with a promise that Mr. Kasich could have unusual authority over domestic and foreign policy in a Trump administration. Mr. Kasich, in his remarks to CNN, did not go into detail and added that he had personally never gotten a call. He added: “I was never interested in being anyone’s vice president. Never considered it. Why would I want to be? I would be the worst vice president. I have too many opinions. ” The Trump campaign has disputed details about the call, and Mr. Trump has said he never offered the   position to Mr. Kasich."
25946,Hillary Clinton Is Getting Surprisingly Little Extra Lift From Blacks and Hispanics - The New York Times,New York Times,Nate Cohn,M,2016-09-14,2016.0,9.0,,"The conventional wisdom holds that sweeping demographic shifts propelled Barack Obama to the presidency. So here’s a simple question: Why haven’t these demographics swept Hillary Clinton to a big polling lead and a smooth glide to victory? Donald J. Trump, after all, has alienated just about every growing demographic group and every category that helped push Mr. Obama to victory. The biggest reason is that demographic change was an overrated contribution to Mr. Obama’s victory, and it will help Mrs. Clinton only at the margins this year. Analysts have conflated all of the effect of higher turnout and percentage of support among nonwhite voters with demographic shifts. In truth, the turnout and support were far more powerful components. Mrs. Clinton is not poised to match the gains Mr. Obama made among nonwhite voters over previous Democratic nominees. That brings the pace of Democratic gains down to the slow crawl of demographic change. The traditional demographic story is fairly simple: Between 2000 and 2012, the white,   share of voters plummeted. According to the census, white,   voters represented just 74 percent of the electorate in 2012  —   down from 81 percent in 2000. The shift was, indeed, driven by demographic change. The white,   share of adult citizens  —   roughly the pool of people eligible to vote  —   fell by roughly the same amount over the same period. The white,   share of adult citizens who are eligible voters has continued to fall  —   probably down to around 68 percent, although the census information is not yet up to date. The growing diversity of the electorate has undoubtedly helped the Democrats. However, many people look at these numbers and assume that the preponderance of Democratic gains over the last decade can be attributed to these shifts. That is not so. In fact, John Kerry would have probably lost the 2004 election even if eligible voters had been just as diverse as they were in 2012. Conversely, Mr. Obama would have probably won his two elections even if the last decade of demographic shifts had never happened. How? Because Democratic gains come from three largely distinct sources: demographics, support and turnout. Demographic trends did help Democrat nominees, a little. But they were helped just as much by favorable turnout trends  —   the huge surge in black turnout, in particular  —   and by favorable trends in support. Mr. Obama did much better than Mr. Kerry among Hispanic voters, among black voters and even among white voters outside the South and Appalachia. On balance, these other factors  —   support and turnout  —   not only outweighed demographic shifts as drivers of growing Democratic strength, but they also made demographic shifts more powerful. Demographic change, for instance, wouldn’t have done Mr. Kerry nearly as much good as it did Mr. Obama because Mr. Kerry didn’t do as well among Hispanic and Asian voters  —   the main drivers of demographic shifts. Here’s one way to look at it: Between 2004 and 2012, the Democratic margin among Hispanic voters roughly doubled, from 18 percentage points to 38 points, according to The Upshot’s estimates, which are based on   polls, census data and the actual results. But over the same period, the number of Hispanic voters increased by just 20 percent, a far smaller contribution to Democratic strength. The impact of turnout and support over demographic shifts was even greater in the battleground states. Many of the key Northern battleground states  —   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Wisconsin  —   saw    changes in the composition of the electorate. In these states, Mr. Obama nonetheless ran ahead of Mr. Kerry by energizing black voters and doing better among white voters as well. Even the states with   “demographic shifts”  —   like North Carolina and Colorado  —   actually had   demographic shifts. And many of the biggest demographic shifts occurred in the Sun Belt states where Democrats talked about being competitive, like Georgia and Arizona, even Texas, but really weren’t. Demographic shifts in these areas were often canceled out by considerable losses among white voters over the same period. My view is that this is somewhat coincidental. Many of the red states with growing nonwhite populations also have the sort of older, Southern, less educated and more religious white populations that have trended toward the Republicans, even in states with far less demographic change and far fewer nonwhite voters (Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Missouri). The states with rapid demographic change but fewer Southern white voters  —   like California or New Jersey  —   did not see the same weakening in Democratic strength. Yes, demographic shifts will continue to slowly help Democrats. But Mrs. Clinton isn’t getting the same leaps in support and turnout among nonwhite voters that let Mr. Obama grow the Democratic coalition as much as he did. On average, Mrs. Clinton leads among Hispanic voters by almost the exact same amount that Mr. Obama did in   polls in 2012. This is lost in many articles that   the most shockingly   results. The results that don’t show her doing so well  —   like a Pew poll showing her leading by 50 to 26  —   are dismissed, even though the same pollsters four years ago showed Mr. Obama faring about as well as he ultimately did.’ ”Another reason Mrs. Clinton’s relative weakness among nonwhite voters has been overlooked is that analysts and journalists have tended to focus on how Mr. Trump is doing worse than Mr. Romney (Mr. Trump has only 15 percent support among Hispanics compared with Mr. Romney’s 27 percent in the exit polls). But they leave out that Mrs. Clinton, by the same measure, is doing worse than Mr. Obama to the same extent.” ’A final problem is that a handful of polls specifically targeting Latino voters tend to show Mrs. Clinton ahead by a larger margin than other surveys do. These pollsters argue that they’re a more accurate reflection of the Latino electorate. Whether this is true is beside the point: The methodology employed by these surveys has always yielded stronger results for Democrats than other surveys, including the exit polls.’ ”As a result, comparing these polls with the exit polls tends to show Democrats gaining when, in fact, they may not be at all. Mr. Obama, for instance, led the final Latino Decisions poll by a margin of 75 percent to 23 percent, about the same as Mrs. Clinton’s current   lead in a recent survey.” ’Why isn’t Mrs. Clinton doing better than Mr. Obama among Hispanic voters? Part of her problem, I suspect, is that Hispanic voters are disproportionately young, and she has had a tough time rallying the support of young voters. It is also possible that she is struggling among less educated   or   Hispanic voters who may vote more similarly to less educated white voters. Mrs. Clinton isn’t doing better than Mr. Obama among black voters, either. While several polls have suggested that Mr. Trump is winning a vanishingly small share of that vote, the polls showed something similar in 2012. Then,   polls showed Mr. Obama beating Mr. Romney by an even greater margin than the polls currently show Mrs. Clinton beating Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama held a   percent lead among likely black voters (92 to 3 among registered voters). Most of the analysis that shows Mrs. Clinton faring better depends on a comparison with the exit polls, which showed Mr. Romney winning 6 percent of the black vote. My view is that the   polls were probably right, and that Mr. Obama won black voters by an even greater margin than the exit polls found. The exit polls are not good at measuring clustered groups, as the exit pollsters have long acknowledged. But regardless of which measure most accurately depicts the electorate, the    comparison is the sounder one. It shows more stability than change. Mrs. Clinton is also in danger of losing at least some of the favorable shifts in turnout between 2004 and 2012, which benefited Mr. Obama. Black turnout may not exceed white turnout again, either because black turnout fades a bit, or because white turnout increases. I’m agnostic on this question: It is very difficult to project turnout with that kind of precision. But there’s more room for Mrs. Clinton to fall here than to make additional gains. The bottom line is that Mrs. Clinton is unlikely to benefit from the same jump in black turnout and support that Mr. Obama had. Similarly, she is unlikely to repeat the same jump in support from Hispanic voters. It is possible she won’t see any gains among these groups at all. Democratic gains from nonwhite voters have greatly slowed, to the marginal gains from demographic shifts alone. The end result: According to The Upshot’s estimates, Mrs. Clinton’s gains from demographic change could be as small as a single percentage point."
25956,"Hillary Clinton Struggles to Gain Traction in Florida, Despite Spending - The New York Times",New York Times,Trip Gabriel,M,2016-09-27,2016.0,9.0,,"TAMPA, Fla.  —   Hillary Clinton has vastly outspent Donald J. Trump on TV ads in Florida. Her 57 campaign offices dwarf Mr. Trump’s afterthought of a ground game. And Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular among Hispanics, who account for nearly one in five Florida voters. Despite these advantages, Mrs. Clinton is struggling in the Sunshine State, unable to assemble the coalition that gave Barack Obama two victories here, and offering Mr. Trump a broad opening in a road to the White House that not long ago seemed closed to him. Mr. Trump is pressing down hard to win the state, campaigning in Miami on Friday and in Fort Myers on Monday, after a rally in Pensacola recently. Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton is not earning the same support among Hispanics, young people or white voters that Mr. Obama captured when he eked out a Florida victory four years ago in the country’s most   swing state. Mrs. Clinton could afford to lose here and still find other routes to victory. Mr. Trump’s electoral map is narrower he must have Florida in his column. But as the most populous and one of the most racially diverse battleground states, Florida is also a bellwether for the nation: a candidate’s struggles here often are mirrored elsewhere. Polling in swing states that Mrs. Clinton once led, prompting predictions a month ago of an Election Day romp, now show Mr. Trump closing the gap or slightly ahead, including in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. “If she underperforms what Obama did in ’12, she’s not going to carry Florida,” said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist in Miami. A poll his firm conducted for Univision, released last week, showed Mrs. Clinton winning 53 percent of Florida Hispanics, compared with the 60 percent who voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. After several weeks in which Mr. Trump attempted to sand off some of his rough edges and attacked Mrs. Clinton for portraying half his supporters as “deplorables,” the share of Florida voters who view the candidates unfavorably is now the same for Mr. Trump as for Mrs. Clinton, according to a   poll. In Miami on Friday, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton’s bodyguards should disarm and “see what happens to her,” a comment that could renew voters’ doubts about his fitness for the presidency. The Clinton campaign maintains it always expected the Florida race to be tight. “Two months before the election, Hillary Clinton is within a couple of points of where President Obama ended on Election Day with Hispanic voters, while Donald Trump has been drastically underperforming Romney by 10 points or more,” John Anzalone, Mrs. Clinton’s pollster for Florida, said in a statement. With 20 million people and 10 major media markets, Florida is a place of vast diversity and contrasts that is a challenging puzzle for any statewide campaign. The traditional playbook has been for Democrats to run up the score in South Florida, with its large nonwhite population, and for Republicans to rack up votes in the conservative panhandle. That leaves Central Florida, and especially Tampa on the Gulf Coast, as one of the state’s most contested swing areas. The booming region has the largest share of registered voters statewide, with one in four voters in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, registered as independents. “The old saying is: ‘As goes Hillsborough County, so goes Florida,’ ” said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Within this swing region, an epicenter of swing voters is the explosively growing New Tampa. It is a community of affordable subdivisions reached by grandiose landscaped entrances off a   highway, attracting young professionals with families. In interviews, undecided voters there seemed uncertain if they would cast ballots at all. Kish Nathan, 45, a computer professional born in India, voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. He has ruled out Mr. Trump, but is unenthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton. “I might not even vote,” he said. Leo Lewis, 51, was reading political news on a laptop outside a Starbucks. Mr. Trump scares him, Mr. Lewis said. Mrs. Clinton, he believes, is dissembling about her health. He, too, is considering sitting out the election. “The world has gotten so bad no matter what you do, no one’s going to fix it,” he said. Some strategists believe the pool of persuadable voters this year is shallower than in the past, which may explain why the tens of millions in TV ads run by Mrs. Clinton and her allies in the state have failed to give her a noticeable advantage. (Mr. Trump and outside supporters have spent about $8 million.) Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, said recently that the Clinton advertising push was a failure. “You give us $22 million, and I’ll produce more votes for you than a damn television ad,” Mr. Hastings told a meeting of Democrats, arguing that television does not reach young voters. Mrs. Clinton’s bulwark is her vast organizing effort, currently focused on registering new voters and signing up volunteers. But Republicans have not been idle: Field teams working for the Republican National Committee and state party have cut the Democrats’ advantage with registered voters in half since 2012. It is now just 258, 000 active voters. The Florida Democratic Party pointed out that of the 146, 000 newly registered Hispanic voters this year, only 15 percent are Republicans. “I want to make sure I give my vote to Hillary,” said Valesca Barilles, who registered for the first time with a Clinton volunteer outside a Dollar Tree store in Tampa last week. Born in Honduras, Ms. Barilles, an assistant bank branch manager, said of Mr. Trump, “I love the U. S. A. and I don’t think we need someone to come and ruin it. ” After poor   efforts during the primaries, Mr. Trump seems to be belatedly getting a ground game together. When he spoke in Pensacola, where the crowd was asked to text “Trump” to a number, some 3, 500 followed up on a reply message about how to check their voter registration, according to the campaign, and 1, 400 signed up to volunteer. “There is an army of R. N. C. volunteers and Trump volunteers crawling every part of this state every day,” said Susan Wiles, Mr. Trump’s state director. Mr. Trump must find a way to turn out a wave of white supporters who are infrequent voters. The campaign concedes that Mitt Romney’s field staff members four years ago drove conventional white turnout in Florida about as high as possible. In this state of   contests, every small demographic shift is closely watched. Mr. Obama won 37 percent of the state’s white vote in 2012. Mrs. Clinton is falling short of that number in    polls with Mr. Trump. “If she’s getting 34, 33, 35 among whites in Florida, I’m going to start to buy a lot of antacids,” said Steve Schale, who ran Mr. Obama’s Florida race in 2008 and was a senior adviser in 2012. Mrs. Clinton could make up for the erosion among whites by gaining with Hispanic voters. But so far, polls show Mrs. Clinton falling short of Mr. Obama’s 60 percent share of Florida Hispanics in 2012. “Against the candidate perceived to be the most hostile to Hispanic voters in modern presidential politics, why is she not exceeding where Barack Obama was?” Mr. Amandi, the Miami pollster, asked. He criticized the Clinton campaign for beginning   advertising only this month and for not doing a forum during the general election campaign with either Univision or Telemundo. “I think it’s too early to hit the panic button, but if these numbers by   aren’t at or slightly above where Obama was, there’s reason to be concerned,” he said. “She’s going to need all these votes to carry Florida. ” And Florida, he added, “is the whole enchilada. ”"

26200,Hillary Clinton Denounces Donald Trump as Untrustworthy on Women’s Issues - The New York Times,New York Times,Alan Rappeport,M,2016-06-11,2016.0,6.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Hillary Clinton assailed Donald J. Trump on Friday as untrustworthy on women’s issues, sharpening her tone against him in her first major speech since becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Finally free to focus on the general election, Mrs. Clinton signaled that she planned to hit her likely Republican opponent in an area of perceived weakness while working to mend fissures within her own party by focusing on issues dear to progressives, such as protecting abortion rights and funding for Planned Parenthood. “When Donald Trump says, ‘Let’s make America great again,’ that is code for let’s take America backward,” Mrs. Clinton said at a Planned Parenthood Action Fund event in Washington. In a   speech, Mrs. Clinton seized on Mr. Trump’s suggestion in March that abortion be banned and that women who violate such a ban face punishment. Although he later retracted the remark amid a bipartisan backlash, Mrs. Clinton made clear that she would not let it go. “Anyone who would so casually agree with the idea of punishing women, like it was nothing to him, the most obvious thing in the world, that’s someone who doesn’t hold women in high regard,” Mrs. Clinton said to loud applause. Mrs. Clinton said that protecting Planned Parenthood’s funding was a top priority amid an onslaught from Republicans who have threatened to shut down the government over its opposition to the organization. She also called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of government money for abortions. Mrs. Clinton has struggled at times this year to appeal to younger women, but she does not expect that to be a problem against Mr. Trump. Her campaign plans to regularly remind female voters about his penchant for making sexist remarks, such as referring to women as “fat pigs” and “dogs. ” On Friday she quoted Mr. Trump as saying that he thought   leave made the country less competitive and that women should work harder if they wanted to earn more. Mr. Trump has said that he will be better for women than Mrs. Clinton, but polls show that so far he is turning them off in a big way. A Gallup survey from April found that 70 percent of women in the country had an unfavorable opinion him. By making Planned Parenthood Action her first campaign stop after capturing the nomination, Mrs. Clinton demonstrated that, instead of making a quick pivot to the center, she is intent on rallying the Democratic base after a bruising primary campaign against Senator Bernie Sanders. Another important step toward party unity came on Thursday night when Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a rousing endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. The two women met privately on Friday morning in Washington to discuss the party’s path forward and how to beat Mr. Trump in November. Ms. Warren is a favorite of the progressive wing of the party and has become one of its most vocal and effective critics of Mr. Trump. She described Mr. Trump as a “racist bully” in a speech on Wednesday night and made a forceful case for Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. The meeting Friday could also fan speculation that Ms. Warren is on Mrs. Clinton’s shortlist of potential running mates. While she has maintained that she loves her current job, Ms. Warren did say Thursday night on MSNBC that she felt she had the capacity to be president. For now Mrs. Clinton is taking on Mr. Trump on her own, and after a difficult week for him in which he drew widespread condemnation for making racist remarks about a federal judge, she is not holding back. She mocked him for walking back his claim that Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel  —   who is presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University  —   was biased because of his Mexican heritage and lamented Mr. Trump’s disparaging treatment of a disabled reporter. Both were examples, she said, of how a Trump presidency would be problematic for more than just women. “Donald Trump would take us in the wrong direction on so many issues that we care about,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He does not see all Americans as Americans. ”"
26215,House Benghazi Report Finds No New Evidence of Wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton - The New York Times,New York Times,David M. Herszenhorn,M,2016-07-03,2016.0,7.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Ending one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report on Tuesday, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead. The   report delivered a broad rebuke of the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department  —   and the officials who led them  —   for failing to grasp the acute security risks in Benghazi, and especially for maintaining outposts there that they could not protect. The committee, led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, also harshly criticized an internal State Department investigation that it said had allowed officials like Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, to effectively choose who would examine their actions. In addition, it included some new details and context about the night of the attacks on the American diplomatic compound and reiterated Republicans’ complaints that the Obama administration had sought to thwart the investigation by withholding witnesses and evidence. The report, which included perhaps the most exhaustive chronology of the attacks to date, did not dispute that United States military forces stationed in Europe could not have reached Benghazi in time to rescue the personnel who died  —   a central finding of previous inquiries. Still, it issued stinging criticism of the overall delay in response and the lack of preparedness on the part of the government. “The assets ultimately deployed by the Defense Department in response to the Benghazi attacks were not positioned to arrive before the final, lethal attack,” the committee wrote. “The fact that this is true does not mitigate the question of why the world’s most powerful military was not positioned to respond. ” But the lack of any clear finding of professional misconduct or dereliction of duty was certain to fuel further criticism of the length of the investigation  —   more than two years  —   and the expense, estimated at more than $7 million. It also bolstered Democrats’ allegations that the inquiry was specifically intended to damage Mrs. Clinton’s presidential prospects. After a campaign stop in Denver, Mrs. Clinton said that the investigation had uncovered nothing to contradict past findings, and that the House committee’s work had assumed a “partisan tinge. ” “I’ll leave it to others to characterize this report,” she said, “but I think it’s pretty clear it’s time to move on. ” Yet even as Mrs. Clinton seemed eager to press forward, she must still contend with the fallout from the committee’s most significant, if inadvertent, discovery: that she exclusively used a private email server during her four years as secretary of state. That revelation has spurred separate investigations into whether classified material was mishandled, including a continuing inquiry by the F. B. I. In a sign that Mr. Gowdy was also facing pressure from the right, two of the committee’s conservative members, Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mike Pompeo of Kansas, wrote a   addendum including somewhat harsher criticism of Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration. After the attack, “with the presidential election just 56 days away, rather than tell the American people the truth and increase the risk of losing an election, the administration told one story privately and a different story publicly,” Mr. Jordan and Mr. Pompeo wrote. Technically, the report is not final until the full committee formally votes to accept it, which it is scheduled to do July 8. Among the committee’s chief findings: ■ Despite authorization from President Obama, no American military forces were deployed to Benghazi on the night of the attacks, and Marines stationed in Spain repeatedly received conflicting orders. ■ The Libyan forces that helped evacuate Americans from a C. I. A. annex to the Benghazi airport were not part of militias allied with the United States, but were fighters previously loyal to Col. Muammar   of Libya. ■ Susan E. Rice, then the United States ambassador to the United Nations, made numerous false statements about the Benghazi attack on television that one State Department press officer described in an email as “off the reservation on five networks!” ■ Senior State Department officials  —   including Mrs. Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills  —   exerted too much influence over the Accountability Review Board that conducted the department’s own inquiry, casting doubt on its independence and findings. ■ The Obama administration repeatedly sought to obstruct the select committee’s investigation by delaying or refusing to respond to requests for documents and testimony. The committee made scant mention of procedures put in place since the Benghazi attacks, which fundamentally changed the way American embassies and consulates operate. The State Department has taken a maximalist approach to security that some diplomats now say makes it difficult for them to carry out their responsibilities. The Defense Department has increased the number of Marine guards at diplomatic posts and created new   teams. Democrats on the committee complained that they had been excluded from decisions on the report, and noted that the Benghazi investigation had dragged on longer than the inquiries into the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the attack on Pearl Harbor and the response to Hurricane Katrina. In the most dramatic confrontation over the two years of the investigation, Mrs. Clinton testified before the committee for more than eight hours in October. The hearing was widely perceived to have backfired on Republicans, as she answered their questions and coolly deflected their attacks. By the time of her testimony, Mrs. Clinton had already taken responsibility for the State Department’s handling of the attacks. Previous investigations concluded that State Department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation. But they also determined that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they had begun. The investigations generally concluded that after the attack, the Obama administration’s talking points were flawed but not deliberately misleading. The Pentagon had no forces that could be readily sent to Benghazi when the crisis began. The closest   gunship was in Afghanistan. There were no armed drones within range of Libya. There was no Marine expeditionary unit, a large seaborne force with its own helicopters, in the Mediterranean Sea. The Africa Command also did not have on hand a force able to respond rapidly to emergencies. Every other regional command had one at the time. The Pentagon was caught unprepared for this type of crisis. On the night of the attacks, the Pentagon was able to divert an unarmed Predator drone operating 90 miles away to Benghazi, and the C. I. A. later used it to help plan an escape route for the surviving Americans. But other military forces were too far away or could not be mobilized in time, military commanders have said. The unclassified version of an independent 2012 report, headed by Thomas R. Pickering, a former diplomat, concluded that “there simply was not enough time, given the speed of the attacks, for armed U. S. military assets to have made a difference. ” But that report did not address whether it would have been prudent to station   forces in the region, a step the Pentagon has since taken. At a news conference at the Capitol on Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy praised as heroes the Americans who died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2012. They included Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and Sean Smith, a State Department information officer, who were killed at the main American diplomatic compound in Benghazi by a mob of militia fighters who had been incited by an   video deriding the Prophet Muhammad. The fighters were apparently further inflamed by news of an assault on the American Embassy in Cairo. Two other Americans, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, who were contractors for the C. I. A. died later when a separate annex run by the agency was hit by mortars. The attacks spanned about eight hours. At the time the select committee was created, there had been at least seven congressional inquiries into the Benghazi attacks in addition to the State Department’s review, with all of them reaching much the same conclusion. Mr. Gowdy urged Americans to read all 800 pages of the report. “You can read this report from pillar to post in less time than our fellow Americans were under attack in Benghazi,” he said."
26239,"Hillary Clinton, North Carolina, Zika: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",New York Times,Jonah Engel Bromwich and Sandra Stevenson,B,2016-07-30,2016.0,7.0,,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Will Hillary Clinton get a convention bounce?  That’s what Democrats were asking Friday, as the final sprint of the presidential campaign began. Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, embarked on a campaign tour that will take them through Pennsylvania and Ohio. Donald Trump, who was heading to Colorado, criticized Mrs. Clinton’s acceptance speech, saying she “ ‘forgot’ to mention the many problems of our country. ” _____ 2. Email accounts connected to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign were hacked in an attack that appears to have come from Russia’s intelligence services, a federal law enforcement official said. If Russia did engineer the hack, as well as last week’s leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee, the moves may represent an escalation of the international information wars. Analysts have long said that hacking between countries is likely to expand, as the method gives states a   method to meddle in one another’s affairs. As our reporter points out, though, their very appeal gives these    tactics the potential to make the international arena more volatile. _____ 3. “Donald Trump, you’re asking Americans to trust you with their future. Let me ask you, have you even read the United States Constitution?” That question was part of an emotional speech delivered on the final night of the Democratic National Convention by Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of an Army captain who died more than a decade ago during the war in Iraq. Mr. Khan emphasized the importance of liberty and equal protection under the law, telling Mr. Trump, “You have sacrificed nothing and no one. ” _____ 4. The American economy continues to expand at a sluggish rate. From April to June, it grew only at a rate of 1. 2 percent, well below the 2. 5 percent that analysts had expected. But there is good news: Wages are beginning to rise more quickly, and consumer spending grew enormously. In Europe, a surge of terrorist attacks has hurt businesses, and Japan’s central bank decided not to take certain extreme measures to boost a flagging economy. _____ 5. A federal appeals court struck down North Carolina’s   voter identification requirement The requirement, imposed as a part of changes to voting rules in 2013, has been criticized by civil rights groups as unfairly targeting   and other minorities. The court’s decision, delivered only months after the requirement was upheld by a Federal District Court judge, upended voting procedures in a state that tends to be up for grabs in presidential elections. And in Wisconsin, a federal judge ruled that parts of the state’s voter ID law are unconstitutional, noting that “a preoccupation with mostly phantom election fraud leads to real incidents of disenfranchisement. ” _____ 6. Florida announced that four cases of Zika found in Miami were most likely caused by infected mosquitoes. The three men and one woman infected are the first people believed to have contracted the virus from insects in the continental United States. The news signifies a new phase in the life of an epidemic that has already spread through dozens of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, causing hundreds of birth defects. _____ 7. Houston, we have competition. Seattle is becoming fertile ground for outer     as the commercial space race heats up. The city is home to two tech billionaires who are funding efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a smattering of smaller companies aiming for the stars. As the head of one such effort put it, “I think we’re putting the space back into the Space Needle. ” _____ 8. Maggie Nolting has some unusual accomplishments under her belt. A    actress, Ms. Nolting ran a   on crutches in May after breaking a foot. She finished with a time good enough to beat 43 people who were running on both feet. She also holds the record for fastest ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro on crutches. Ms. Nolting has some tips for   crutch racers: Wrap the tops with sports shirts and smear your underarms with an antichafing gel wear the thickest gloves you can find and optimize your hop. _____ 9. After all the roommate drama of your 20s, it’s nice to imagine a home of your own. But some New Yorkers, priced out of the city’s real estate game, have given up that dream, finding that pooling resources with friends can more quickly make homeownership a reality. “It’s a really good way for people to work the system,” says one real estate saleswoman. “Not everybody has that money for a down payment. _____ 10. It’s tough to find a contemporary comedian whose jokes are appropriate for kids. That’s what our comedy critic found when he took his daughter to see a show, and ended up keeping his hands over her ears for a significant part of the night. If you are set on doing the same, he suggests checking with the theater in advance  —   or simply buying tickets to see Jim Gaffigan, above, a comedian so   that he has performed for the pope. _____ 11. It’s the weekend, and while many of you are surely excited to groove your worries away, others may be reluctant to set foot anywhere near a dance floor. Believe it or not, professional dancers have the same problem. Some worry about being treated like “show horses” others have trouble translating formal training into fun. “When I started going out, my   mind was always looking to be ‘correct,’ ” one dancer says. “Eventually I saw that   is completely antithetical to the vibe of a good dance party. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

26262,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Ages 68 and 70, Share Few Health Details - The New York Times",New York Times,Patrick Healy,M,2016-09-11,2016.0,9.0,,"Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have been more secretive and selective than many recent presidential nominees in providing    details about their personal health  —   a particularly striking departure, experts say, given the candidates’ age. No American election has ever featured two   nominees as old as Mr. Trump, 70, and Mrs. Clinton, 68, and they have kept a grueling pace for more than a year. Yet they have declined to share the latest information about their health or to make their doctors available for interviews. Each released a brief medical statement in 2015 neither has added to it since. Mr. Trump has been especially unforthcoming, even as he has sought to turn health into an issue in the presidential race, questioning Mrs. Clinton’s “physical and mental strength and stamina” as his allies push unfounded rumors that she is ill. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said Monday that he would have “no problem releasing additional records” about his health if Mrs. Clinton did the same. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton, who has released more details than Mr. Trump, said the onus was on him to match her disclosures. Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Mitt Romney have released details in the months before Election Day or directed their doctors to field questions. John McCain allowed some reporters to review more than 1, 100 pages of his medical records. Among Democratic nominees, Al Gore and John Kerry spoke openly about their health Mr. Kerry had survived prostate cancer. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were more reticent: Their aides argued that the two were young men with no health problems, though Mr. Clinton granted an interview on his health in 1996 under pressure from his Republican opponent, Bob Dole. Mr. Trump, who regularly eats fast food and says he does not sleep much or take long vacations, has provided only a   statement from his gastroenterologist last December. It contained no details about his heart rate, respiratory rate, cholesterol level, past medications or family medical history. It did include several laudatory declarations, describing Mr. Trump’s blood pressure ( ) and laboratory test results as “astonishingly excellent. ” The doctor, Harold N. Bornstein of Manhattan, concluded that Mr. Trump, if victorious, “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency”  —   a claim that was widely mocked as unprovable and unscientific. Mrs. Clinton issued a significantly more detailed   letter from her physician in July 2015 that included information about a concussion Mrs. Clinton suffered in 2012, which left her with a blood clot in her head and double vision. Her doctor, Lisa Bardack of Mount Kisco, N. Y. said those symptoms were resolved within two months. Mr. Clinton, however, has said that Mrs. Clinton “required six months of very serious work to get over” the concussion  —   a statement that helped feed conspiracy theories among Republicans that Mrs. Clinton’s concussion was worse than disclosed, though there is no medical evidence to support that conclusion. Doctors and medical experts said they had rarely seen so few details or updated information about the health of presidential nominees. “Voters deserve far more information from Clinton and Trump about their health than we have now,” said Dr. Burton Lee, who was the elder George Bush’s personal physician during his four years as president. “The public has a right to know, but you just don’t have transparency with these two candidates on much of anything. That’s a given. ” Lawrence O. Gostin, a lawyer on the faculty of medicine at Georgetown, said Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump had both fallen short of releasing    medical information, which he described as “extremely important,” given their age. “A person’s fitness, particularly at an older age, can change very quickly, and the rigors of a campaign  —   all the speeches, travel, long days and nights  —   can take a toll on your health as well,” said Mr. Gostin, who worked with Mrs. Clinton on her health insurance overhaul effort in 1993 and 1994. “The campaign is a kind of trial run on a patient’s ability to serve as president, so the public deserves details on their health after a year of running. ” Mr. Gostin, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, said he was not implying that she had any health problems. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton said Monday that she had provided sufficient information about her personal health in the 2015 statement and had no plans to release more, though they pointed to remarks last week by Dr. Bardack reiterating that Mrs. Clinton “is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States. ” The statement last week was a response to fake documents, purportedly by Dr. Bardack, claiming that Mrs. Clinton had suffered seizures and memory loss after her concussion. Her advisers pushed back forcefully when asked if Mrs. Clinton or her doctor would give an interview about her health, arguing that the 2015 statement disclosed far more details about past examinations, vital signs and incidents like Mrs. Clinton’s concussion than Mr. Trump’s medical summary last year. “Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in the race who has met the standard expected of presidential candidates,” said Glen Caplin, a Clinton spokesman. “Donald Trump needs to produce a real doctor’s letter, written by a credible doctor, that details the state of his health for voters. ” Trump campaign advisers said Mr. Trump had no plans to grant interviews about his health, insisting that his age was not an issue. They said he was in good shape, disputing the opinion of some friends of Mr. Trump that he has gained weight recently. The Trump campaign declined a request for an interview with Dr. Bornstein. For much of American history, presidents and candidates were secretive about their health. Woodrow Wilson suffered a severe stroke in 1919 that largely incapacitated him, a condition that he and his advisers hid for a time. Franklin D. Roosevelt was rarely photographed in his wheelchair, and John F. Kennedy’s chronic back pain and regimen of medications were concealed. Mental health issues emerged as a liability, too: Thomas F. Eagleton gave up the 1972 Democratic   nomination after acknowledging his past electroconvulsive therapy for depression. But since Reagan’s nomination in 1980 at age 69  —   then the oldest   nominee to date  —   candidates’ medical histories have been routinely disclosed and scrutinized. Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist, recalled that Lloyd Bentsen, the 1988   nominee, provided extensive details about his health “because he was 67, which was considered quite old at the time. ” “I think health transparency is important and candidates have to take that responsibility seriously,” Mr. Devine said. “As transparency goes, Trump’s   statement is preposterous. ” Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser to Mr. McCain in 2008, said most presidential campaigns want to disclose as little as possible while providing enough information to claim to be transparent. But he suggested that the balance should tilt toward more disclosure this year. “You have two candidates around 70 years old, and while it hasn’t happened since 1974, you’ve had many vice presidents succeed to the office of the presidency,” Mr. Schmidt said. “When you have candidates at their ages, the disclosure should be on the burdensome side. ”"
26266,"Hillary Clinton Denounces the ‘Alt-Right,’ and the Alt-Right Is Thrilled - The New York Times",New York Times,Alan Rappeport,M,2016-08-30,2016.0,8.0,,"As Hillary Clinton assailed Donald J. Trump on Thursday for fanning the flames of racism embraced by the “” the community of activists that tends to lurk anonymously in the internet’s dark corners could hardly contain its glee. Mrs. Clinton’s speech was intended to link Mr. Trump to a fringe ideology of conspiracies and hate, but for the leaders of the   the attention from the Democratic presidential nominee was a moment in the political spotlight that offered a new level of credibility. It also provided a valuable opportunity for   and recruiting. Jared Taylor, editor of the white nationalist publication American Renaissance,   Mrs. Clinton’s remarks, questioning her praise of establishment Republicans and eagerly anticipating her discussion of his community. “Come on, Hillary,” he wrote. “Talk about Alt Right. ” In an ode to Mr. Trump’s characterization of Jeb Bush, Mr. Taylor described her speech as “low energy. ” Other white nationalists mocked Mrs. Clinton, saying she sounded like a neoconservative and a “grandma,” while welcoming the publicity. Mr. Trump has publicly kept his distance from the   but his critics have accused him of offering subtle cues to invite its support. His appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, to be chief executive of his campaign was cheered by   members who are avid readers of the Breitbart website. The   claims to support the preservation of white culture in the United States, and many of its members want to see an overhaul of the entire political system. However, its views are widely seen as white supremacist and  . Many who align themselves with   philosophies say that they do not subscribe to all of Mr. Trump’s policies, but that electing him would be a step in the right direction because of his “America First” worldview and his hard line on immigration. This week, some expressed disappointment that Mr. Trump appeared to be softening his tone on deporting people who are in the country illegally. Richard B. Spencer, the president of the   National Policy Institute, who is credited with coming up with the name “” pushed back against claims that the group promotes violence and said in a statement that there was a double standard at play. “While Hillary  Co. condemn the    —   nonviolent activists seeking social change, largely through a vibrant internet presence  —   she allows noted supporters of terror to attend her rallies and has never once disavowed the actions of domestic terrorists associated with Black Lives Matter,” Mr. Spencer said. Mrs. Clinton’s public criticism of the   could turn out to be a boon for the movement, and its members did their best to capitalize on the moment. Some, in an effort to show a lighthearted side, circulated footage of Mr. Taylor playing the saxophone at the group’s most recent conference. The white nationalist website VDare published a “What Is the  ?” video and blasted out a   pitch warning, “Hillary wants to ignite a witch hunt against the   because she knows we are finally starting to make an impact on the public’s thinking about immigration. ” And the Stormfront forum set up an online thread for potential new members. After Mrs. Clinton’s speech, one group of white nationalists convened a   videoconference that was broadcast on YouTube. The consensus was that Mrs. Clinton was “toothless” and “lackluster,” and they expressed disappointment that she had not mentioned   leaders by name. She made reference only to David Duke, the former Klansman whose support Mr. Trump was slow to disavow. Although the   tried to put its best foot forward, there was plenty of venom directed at Mrs. Clinton, and the conspiracy theories ran wild. A popular attack was the continuing effort to raise questions about her health. By addressing the   in such a prominent setting, Mrs. Clinton ran the risk of helping its cause. But Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, dismissed the idea that Mrs. Clinton was doing the public a disservice by drawing attention to the  . “I think every public official ought to denounce racism, and that is what Secretary Clinton did,” Mr. Cohen said, noting that the   ideology opposes the notion that all people are equal. Referring to the term “” which was trending on Twitter, he added, “It is a fancy, almost antiseptic term for white supremacy in the digital world. ”"
26283,Hillary Clinton’s Doctor Says Pneumonia Led to Abrupt Exit From 9/11 Event - The New York Times,New York Times,Jonathan Martin and Amy Chozick,B,2016-09-12,2016.0,9.0,,"Hillary Clinton is being treated for pneumonia and dehydration, her doctor said on Sunday, hours after she abruptly left a ceremony in New York honoring the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and had to be helped into a van by Secret Service agents. The incident, which occurred after months of questions about her health from her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, and his campaign, is likely to increase pressure on Mrs. Clinton to address the issue and release detailed medical records, which she has so far declined to do. Mrs. Clinton was taken from the morning event at ground zero to the Manhattan apartment of her daughter, Chelsea. About 90 minutes after arriving there, Mrs. Clinton emerged from the apartment in New York’s Flatiron district. She waved to onlookers and posed for pictures with a little girl on the sidewalk. “I’m feeling great,” Mrs. Clinton said. “It’s a beautiful day in New York. ” Mrs. Clinton left in her motorcade without the group of reporters that is designated to travel with her in public. A campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, indicated that she had returned to her Chappaqua, N. Y. residence sometime after 1 p. m. and Mrs. Clinton was not seen publicly the rest of the day. Mr. Merrill initially described Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, as feeling “overheated” at the commemoration ceremony. But just after 5 p. m. a campaign official said Mrs. Clinton’s physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, had examined the candidate at her home in Chappaqua, and Dr. Bardack said in a statement that Mrs. Clinton was “rehydrated and recovering nicely. ” “Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies,” Dr. Bardack’s statement said, adding that on Friday morning, after a prolonged cough, Mrs. Clinton was given a diagnosis of pneumonia. “She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule,” Dr. Bardack added. “At this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. ” Dr. Bardack did not indicate what sort of pneumonia Mrs. Clinton had or elaborate on the nature of the examination last week, whether Mrs. Clinton had a fever today, or a host of other issues that could offer more precise insights about her condition. Late Sunday night, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign said she was canceling her plans to travel to California on Monday for what had been a planned   trip there. A video of Mrs. Clinton taken by an attendee at the ceremony captured what appeared to be her legs buckling as she struggled to steady herself and walk to her van. She required assistance from two Secret Service agents, who held her on either side, to move off a curb and into the van.   images revealed that her feet were dragging as she was hoisted into the vehicle. The episode thrust questions about Mrs. Clinton’s health and the transparency of her campaign squarely into the last two months of the race, which many polls show has grown tighter. For months Republicans have, with scarce evidence, questioned the stamina of Mrs. Clinton, 68, and claimed she is ill, often pointing to her repeated coughing bouts. She has brushed off such claims. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, 70, have shared substantially less information about their health than some previous presidential candidates. And Mrs. Clinton revealed that she had pneumonia and had been prescribed medication only after the startling video emerged of her being unable to walk under her own volition after the ceremony. Her campaign initially did not offer any information about why she had left early or her whereabouts. Twice during the day, she abandoned the group of reporters assigned to cover her public movements. Campaign officials did not respond to multiple inquiries about whether Mrs. Clinton had been treated by a doctor or had taken any medications. Even some members of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign staff had been unaware of her recent diagnosis. Huma Abedin, Mrs. Clinton’s   aide, sent an email to the full campaign staff on Sunday that included the doctor’s note, to share with them “the full picture. ” “Onward as H. R. C. would say,” Ms. Abedin wrote in the message, the contents of which were disclosed by a Clinton aide who requested anonymity to share an internal campaign email. Temperatures were in the high 70s on Sunday morning in New York, and humidity was high. Mr. Trump also attended the ceremony, as did many other dignitaries. Other attendees at the event said afterward that Mrs. Clinton had not appeared ill when she first arrived at the former site of the World Trade Center. “She seemed fine,” said Representative Peter T. King of New York, a Republican, who recalled speaking briefly with Mrs. Clinton around 8:30 a. m. But about an hour later there was a minor commotion, Mr. King said. A number of New York’s current and former elected officials had been standing in silence as the names of the victims of the attacks were read. Suddenly, Mrs. Clinton, a former New York senator, left her position. Mrs. Clinton emerged last week from an August mostly focused on private   with campaign events in Ohio, Illinois, Florida, North Carolina and Missouri. On Wednesday, she participated in an NBC forum on national security, and on Friday she attended a Manhattan   where she characterized half of Mr. Trump’s supporters as a “basket of deplorables. ” The candidates had taken their advertisements off the air to honor the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, and Mr. Trump said nothing when he was asked on Sunday about Mrs. Clinton’s condition. But he and his supporters have aggressively sought to raise questions about Mrs. Clinton’s health in recent months. Mr. Trump has highlighted her recurring cough and wrote on Twitter last month that “both candidates” should “release detailed medical records. ” (Mr. Trump has issued only a limited summary of his health.) Questions about the health of presidential hopefuls are hardly new to this campaign, but long before the exacting scrutiny of the modern media environment, campaigns were often able to suppress information about the ailments of candidates. Rumors about Franklin D. Roosevelt’s health, for example, pervaded his final presidential campaign in 1944, but he campaigned vigorously and his aides kept the extent of the heart disease that would kill him the following year out of the news. More recently, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and Senator John McCain, each of whom was the Republican presidential nominee while in his 70s, faced questions about their physical condition. “The physical demands of running for president, even with private planes and Secret Service protection, are more difficult than the mental demands,” said Scott Reed, who managed Mr. Dole’s 1996 campaign. Mr. Trump has also been criticized for sharing few details about his health, providing only a brief statement from his personal physician in December. Short on particulars like heart rate, cholesterol level or family history, it described Mr. Trump in laudatory terms, saying that he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. ” The physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, later told NBC News that he had written the statement in five minutes while a black car waited outside his office to collect it. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has tried to bat away rumors about her health, including releasing a letter from Mrs. Clinton’s doctor saying she was in “excellent health. ” But aides have dismissed such questions as a way to distract from the issue of Mr. Trump’s not releasing his tax returns. In July 2015, Mrs. Clinton issued a detailed   letter from her physician that included a concussion she sustained in 2012, while she was secretary of state it left her with a blood clot in her head and double vision. Dr. Bardack, Mrs. Clinton’s physician, said those symptoms had been resolved within two months. The candidate’s husband, Bill Clinton, however, has said that she “required six months of very serious work to get over” the concussion  —   a statement that helped feed conspiracy theories among Republicans that the injury was worse than initially disclosed, though there is no medical evidence to support those theories. Asked whether she was concerned that such questions about her health would affect the election, as the polls have tightened, Mrs. Clinton told reporters on her campaign plane last week: “I’m not concerned about the conspiracy theories. There are so many of them, I’ve lost track of them. ”"

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton’s diagnosis of pneumonia has grounded her for a few days and shifted the focus of the presidential race to the candidates’ health. Mrs. Clinton, 68, and Donald Trump, 70, have promised to release more detailed information from their doctors. The issue isn’t just their state of vigor but whether they operate with more insularity than transparency. Mr. Trump also demanded that Mrs. Clinton apologize for calling some of his supporters “deplorables” and released an ad showcasing the remarks on national cable and in four battleground states. _____ 2. President Obama will veto a bill that would allow the families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot, the White House said. Since both the House and Senate passed the legislation with majorities, the president could face the first veto override of his presidency. He also met with congressional leaders, above, to discuss measures needed to finance the government after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, since lawmakers have not agreed on a budget. _____ 3. The U. N. secretary general, Ban   is racing to get the Paris climate agreement into effect  —   possibly even before the U. S. election. The pact goes into force when 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions formally sign on, conditions that are more than halfway met. The world’s three largest emitters  —   the U. S. China, above and Brazil  —   are on board. This year is shaping up to be the third consecutive hottest on record, and some scientists warn that the oceans’ ability to absorb excess heat has masked the scale of the problem. These graphics lay out the issues. _____ 4. The N. C. A. A. made a surprise announcement: All its championships are being moved from North Carolina for this academic year because the state passed laws the group said violated the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The N. B. A. already moved next February’s   Game from Charlotte, and stars like Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman have canceled concerts in the state. _____ 5. Florida’s offer of free Zika testing for pregnant women has increased rather than decreased their anxieties. That’s because so many responded that state labs are overwhelmed, and the wait for results can stretch to six weeks, complicating already difficult decisions about possibly terminating pregnancies. Above, workers went door to door to take blood samples. _____ 6. Colin Kaepernick, above right, and his teammate Eric Reid knelt during the national anthem before the San Francisco 49ers played their first game of the season against the Los Angeles Rams (10:20 p. m. Eastern, ESPN). Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the anthem to protest racial injustice has emboldened players on other teams  —   and in other sports  —   to make their own symbolic gestures of dissent. Such moves have been rare, in part because athletes are often preoccupied with team morale and financial and branding issues. _____ 7. If you’re forever playing   our television experts can speed you along. Their list of the best shows that emerged over the summer includes some of contenders for Emmys on Sunday, including the documentary series “O. J.: Made in America” (ESPN). There’s also “Stranger Things,” above, an oddly straightforward horror story set in 1983. Our experts also suggest a few newbies, like Amazon’s promising pilots “I Love Dick” and the reboot of “The Tick. ” _____ 8. Feel whipsawed by the shift in the last few years from demonizing fat for health problems to blaming sugar? Historical documents discovered by a researcher show that the sugar industry paid several Harvard scientists in the 1960s to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and promote saturated fat as the culprit instead. “They were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades,” said a medical professor who helped bring the case to light. _____ 9. The Syrian   called for in an agreement by the U. S. and Russia had an uneven start. Violations were reported in the north and south of the country shortly after it went into effect. The timing coincided with Eid   the Muslim Feast of the Sacrifice, which commemorates a story central to Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son at God’s behest. One Syrian activist, pessimistic that the   would make any difference in the conflict, posted on Facebook: “and they gathered like sheep in front of the guillotine. ” _____ 10.

Finally, this may hearten many Medicare beneficiaries: Claims for skilled nursing, home health care or outpatient therapy are not supposed to be rejected just because a patient has ceased to improve. In fact, a federal judge has ordered supervisors to do a better job of making that clear to health care providers and claims adjudicators. The actual rule is that Medicare must approve such services when they are “necessary to maintain the patient’s current condition or prevent or slow further deterioration. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

26401,"Bernie Sanders, Eyeing Convention, Willing to Harm Hillary Clinton in the Homestretch - The New York Times",New York Times,"Patrick Healy, Yamiche Alcindor and Jeremy W. Peters",B,2016-05-19,2016.0,5.0,,"Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a   phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July  —   or even wrest the nomination from her. Advisers to Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday that he was newly resolved to remain in the race, seeing an aggressive campaign as his only chance to pressure Democrats into making fundamental changes to how presidential primaries and debates are held in the future. They said he also held out hope of capitalizing on any late stumbles by Mrs. Clinton or any damage to her candidacy, whether by scandal or by the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump. After sounding subdued if not downbeat about the race for weeks, Mr. Sanders resumed a combative posture against Mrs. Clinton, demanding on Wednesday that she debate him before the June 7 primary in California and highlighting anew what he asserted were her weaknesses against Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders, his advisers said, has been buoyed by a stream of polls showing him beating Mr. Trump by larger margins than Mrs. Clinton in some battleground states, and by his belief that an upset victory in California could have a psychological impact on convention delegates who already have doubts about Mrs. Clinton. But his newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton a   arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees and the party’s rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. While Mr. Sanders says he does not want Mr. Trump to win in November, his advisers and allies say he is willing to do some harm to Mrs. Clinton in the shorter term if it means he can capture a majority of the 475 pledged delegates at stake in California and arrive at the Philadelphia convention with maximum political power. Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the campaign did not think its attacks would help Mr. Trump in the long run, but added that the senator’s team was “not thinking about” the possibility that they could help derail Mrs. Clinton from becoming the first woman elected president. “The only thing that matters is what happens between now and June 14,” Mr. Devine said, referring to the final Democratic primary, in the District of Columbia. “We have to put the blinders on and focus on the best case to make in the upcoming states. If we do that, we can be in a strong position to make the best closing argument before the convention. If not, everyone will know in   and we’ll have to take a hard look at where things stand. ” The prospect of a   Democratic fight is deeply troubling to party leaders who are eager for Mrs. Clinton and House and Senate candidates to turn to attacking Mr. Trump without being diverted by Democratic strife. Mr. Sanders has won nearly 10 million votes, compared to Mrs. Clinton’s 13 million, and Democratic leaders say she needs time to begin courting the young voters, liberals and other Sanders supporters who view her as an ally of corporate and   interests. But Mr. Sanders has sharpened his language of late, saying Tuesday night that the party faced a choice to remain “dependent on   campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy” or “welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change. ” Mr. Sanders’s   instincts have been encouraged by his   campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, who has been blistering against the Clinton camp and the party establishment. On Wednesday, he took to CNN to accuse Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic national chairwoman, of “throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning. ” For weeks, some current and former Sanders campaign workers have privately acknowledged feeling disheartened about Mr. Weaver’s determination to go after the Democratic National Committee, fearing a pitched battle with the party they hope to support in the general election. The intraparty fighting has affected morale, they say, and raised concerns that Mr. Weaver, a longtime Sanders aide who more recently ran a comic book store, was not devoted to achieving Democratic unity. Several described the campaign’s message as having devolved into a   with perceived conspiracies on the part of Mrs. Clinton’s allies. Democratic leaders said they wanted to do everything possible to avoid having   tensions send the Philadelphia convention into the sort of chaos they had expected to mar the Republican convention. So far, though, Mr. Sanders has not indicated that he would ask his delegates to support Mrs. Clinton, as she did in 2008 for Barack Obama. “I’m hopeful that the two candidates will come together, and soon, which could blunt the possibility of real trouble at our convention,” said Edward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a Clinton supporter who is chairman of the Philadelphia host committee for the convention. “But you look at what happened in Nevada, and you worry. ” The melee there, at which Sanders supporters revolted and threatened the state Democratic chairwoman in a fight over delegates, intensified concerns among Clinton allies. Senator Barbara Boxer of California, who attended the convention, said she spoke with Mr. Sanders late Tuesday and said he was “distressed” by the Nevada episode. “He will be judged as whether or not he has leadership qualities by the way he handles this,” she said. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who is close to Mr. Sanders, spoke with Mr. Sanders on Friday about not letting the state convention devolve into a messy fight. They spoke again on Tuesday afternoon, and Mr. Reid complained that a staff member who had attended feared for her safety. But Mr. Sanders’s subsequent statement condemning the violence, which mostly dwelled on how dismissively he felt the party was treating him, did little to soothe Mr. Reid’s unease. “Bernie and I have known each other for a long time, and I believe he is better than this,” Mr. Reid said Wednesday. But some Sanders supporters said that Democrats were ignoring an undercurrent of anger among those who fear that Mrs. Clinton, if elected, would lack the courage to challenge her friends and political contributors. “We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention’s agenda, rather than slip back into centrist Democratic thinking if she gets elected,” said Tick Segerblom, a state senator in Nevada and a Sanders supporter. “I think there could be some chaos at the convention  —   at least outside, with a lot of anarchists, socialists, young people. ” Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has largely taken Mr. Sanders’s latest broadsides in stride. In soliciting donations Wednesday, it said that the   battle against Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump was “one of the toughest parts of our campaign so far. ” A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment about Mr. Sanders’s debate proposal in California. Privately, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers said Mr. Sanders could win California but emphasized their confidence that Mrs. Clinton would still win the nomination. She now has a total of 2, 293 pledged delegates and superdelegates she needs 90 more to win the nomination, although superdelegates can shift their support up to the convention. Mr. Sanders has 1, 533 pledged delegates and superdelegates. Mr. Sanders is now running slightly behind Mrs. Clinton in California in public polls. Ben Tulchin, Mr. Sanders’s pollster, pointed to signs of rising voter registration in California among young people and independents  —   two core Sanders constituencies  —   as evidence that he could win the state. But Hispanic registration is also rising, which could benefit Mrs. Clinton. With Mr. Sanders expected to campaign aggressively over the next three weeks, his supporters in the state said they were focused on winning the primary, not on November. “If you want to talk about historic, let’s talk about the record turnout numbers at his rallies,” said Mayor Bao Nguyen of Garden Grove, Calif. a Sanders supporter. “Senator Sanders isn’t obliged to help Secretary Clinton if she wins. That’s a decision his team can make if they face that choice. ” Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, Mr. Sanders’s lone endorser in the Senate, said that the party’s divisions would only deepen if Mr. Sanders was driven from the race now. “You can’t say to them, ‘Hey we don’t want to hear your views,’ and shut the door on them,” Mr. Merkley said, “and then a month later open the door and say, ‘Hey, can you come in and help us out?’"
26424,"From Links to Lucifer to Calls for Execution, Republicans Seethe at Hillary Clinton - The New York Times",New York Times,Alan Rappeport,M,2016-07-21,2016.0,7.0,,"There have been aerial signs reading “Hillary for Prison,” rallying cries of “lock her up,” misogynistic souvenir swag mocking her body parts and, in a violent turn, a public call for Hillary Clinton to be executed. Political conventions are usually a mix of talking up the party’s nominee and denouncing the opponent. But as Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Donald J. Trump, the venom being directed at Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has taken a strikingly sinister tone that makes the days of   and   at past conventions seem tame. Here are some of the harshest attacks leveled at Mrs. Clinton this week. Hillary Clinton’s responsibility for the deaths of Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 has been a regular topic of conversation among Republicans, and on Tuesday Al Baldasaro, a delegate for Mr. Trump from New Hampshire who advises him on veterans issues, suggested that she had committed treason. “This whole thing disgusts me  —   Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,” Mr. Baldasaro said on The Kuhner Report radio show. Mrs. Clinton has not been charged with committing any crimes. Mr. Trump has previously described Mr. Baldasaro, a state representative from New Hampshire who was on the convention floor on Tuesday night, as his favorite veteran. Mr. Baldasaro had no regrets about the remark on Wednesday, telling WMUR of Manchester, N. H. that he would also be satisfied with other forms of execution. “As far as I’m concerned, it is treason and the penalty for treason is the firing squad  —   or maybe it’s the electric chair now,” he said. The U. S. Secret Service later said it was investigating the matter. If execution is taking things too far, sending Mrs. Clinton to prison is another popular wish at the Republican National Convention. The chants of “lock her up!” echoed through Quicken Loans Arena on Monday night when Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general advising Mr. Trump, ripped into Mrs. Clinton for her “careless” use of a private email server as secretary of state. “Lock her up,” he said, rousing the crowd. “You’re damn right. There’s nothing wrong with that. Lock her up! You know why we’re saying that? If I did a 10th of what she did, I would be in jail today. ” Mr. Flynn, who was briefly considered as a potential running mate for Mr. Trump, also called on “Crooked Hillary Clinton” to quit the race because of her lack of integrity. Ben Carson got a prime speaking slot at the convention on Tuesday evening, and he took a different approach at questioning Mrs. Clinton’s integrity. Digging into her college thesis about Saul Alinksy, the   community organizer and radical, Mr. Carson suggested that Mrs. Clinton admired him. Then he pointed out that Mr. Alinsky had acknowledged Lucifer on the dedication page of one of his books, suggesting that such an association was somehow damning for Mrs. Clinton. “Are we willing to elect someone as president who has as their role model someone who acknowledges Lucifer?” Mr. Carson asked. “Think about that. ” The connection might seem like a stretch, but Mr. Carson, who ended his own presidential bid in March, doubled down on his assertions Wednesday morning. “If she believed that at that time  —   and now you look at her actions  —   you look at what she advocates, the killing of babies, the dissolution of the traditional family, all these kinds of things  —   those are pretty consistent, quite frankly,” Mr. Carson said on CNN. One of the most emotional attacks on Mrs. Clinton came from Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in the 2012 Benghazi attack. On the first night of the convention, she called Mrs. Clinton a liar who was responsible for her son’s death. “For all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of this cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has brought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton,” she told the cheering crowd on Monday. “I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son. ” After laying blame on Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Smith also accused her of lying to her directly about how her son, Sean, had died and said that the State Department had withheld information from her. “How could she do this to me? ,” she said. “How could she do this to any American family?”"
26513,Hillary Clinton Struggles to Find Footing in Unusual Race - The New York Times,New York Times,"Amy Chozick, Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin",B,2016-11-02,2016.0,11.0,,"Democrats could hardly believe their good fortune last month when it became clear that Hillary Clinton was headed to a general election showdown with Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump carried so much baggage and had insulted so many voting blocs that some Clinton supporters began to imagine a landslide. But early optimism that this would be an easy race is evaporating. In the corridors of Congress, on airplane shuttles between New York and Washington, at donor gatherings and on conference calls, anxiety is spreading through the Democratic Party that Mrs. Clinton is struggling to find her footing. While she enjoys many demographic advantages heading into the fall, key Democrats say they are growing worried that her campaign has not determined how to combat her unpredictable, often wily Republican rival, to whom criticism seldom sticks and rules of decorum seem not to apply. Mrs. Clinton is pressing ahead with a conventional campaign, echoing the 2012 themes used against the Republican nominee that year, Mitt Romney. But Mr. Trump is running a jarringly different crusade: accusing her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of rape proposing that the country conduct brutal methods of torture and suggesting that South Korea and Japan be permitted to develop nuclear arms. Prominent Democrats say a more provocative approach is needed. “The guy’s a maniac,” John Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, said about Mr. Trump. Referring to a famous 1964 political message, he said, “You could run the old L. B. J. ad against Goldwater, with ‘Three, two, one,’ and a hydrogen bomb blows up with a little girl counting daisies. ” Of course, Mr. Trump faces many hurdles himself, and has stumbled in managing his growing campaign as he shifts toward a general election. But Democrats suggest that the past few weeks have shown that Mrs. Clinton and her aides must become more agile and creative against him. The sense of nervousness crystallized this week when Mrs. Clinton devoted campaign events across California to hitting Mr. Trump for not releasing his tax returns and depicting him as a cold corporate titan who profited off the housing crisis. Such charges helped undermine Mr. Romney four years ago. Yet Mrs. Clinton’s remarks received little   coverage in the news media, while cable channels went live with Mr. Trump’s    recitation of “Crooked Hillary,” his favored nickname for her. Ken Salazar, the former Colorado senator who has been mentioned as a possible Clinton running mate, said the campaign should draw a sharp contrast between Mr. Trump’s shortcomings and Mrs. Clinton’s potential to be “the most qualified person to be president in our lifetime. ” “The campaign needs to expose Donald Trump as the opposite  —   selfish, egomaniac, divisive and unqualified to be president,” Mr. Salazar said in an email. Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said that the news coverage Mr. Trump is receiving is not helping him. She said that unlike Mr. Trump, who uses “nothing but his own mouth,” Mrs. Clinton has a campaign that employs many methods of communication, including videos, respected surrogates and bilingual outreach. “We hear from friends who think we should act more like Trump or criticize us for sometimes using traditional communications tactics,” she said. “But we don’t think that’s the answer. ” As a candidate, Mrs. Clinton is not without her own issues to overcome, including her inability to quickly put away Senator Bernie Sanders and her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, feeding a perception she is not trustworthy. In a report delivered this past week to Congress, the State Department’s inspector general strongly criticized her for the practice. But it is the campaign’s approach to Mr. Trump that is making even Mrs. Clinton’s most loyal supporters uneasy. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York is concerned that she lacks a comprehensive strategy to confront Mr. Trump, and has told Democrats that the Clinton campaign must bring on a senior staff member dedicated only to the Trump portfolio. “As soon as she clinches the nomination, we need a   person in the campaign whose sole job is to respond to Trump, almost on an hourly basis,” said Mr. Schumer, who has begun conversations with Clinton officials about who could fill that role. During a conference call this month,   female supporters pressed Mrs. Clinton’s advisers about her message  —   which has as a slogan “Breaking Down Barriers”  —   and whether it needs to shift for the general election. “The message will be broadening,” Karen Finney, a senior adviser, explained, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The New York Times. “But,” she added, leaving some participants perplexed, “breaking down barriers and unity will continue to be part of the theme because Hillary believes we need to come together as a country in many ways. ” Debates have broken out in Mrs. Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters over the best approach to take. Some advisers worry that by running against Mr. Trump as she would a traditional Republican candidate, Mrs. Clinton is actually making the   star appear more legitimate. This month, when Mr. Trump suggested he would reduce the national debt by negotiating with creditors to accept something less than full payment, economists dismissed the idea as fanciful. Hours later, the Clinton campaign sent out a news release about Mr. Trump’s “risky” idea of defaulting on the national debt with a response from Gene Sperling, formerly a senior economic adviser to both President Obama and Mr. Clinton, condemning the idea. The seriousness of the campaign’s response seemed to elevate a nonsensical proposal. “That is a danger,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. “You have to take the threat of Trump becoming president seriously, but you shouldn’t treat him as a serious person. ” At the same time, Mrs. Clinton’s attempts at poking Mr. Trump have felt tame compared with what he has unleashed. The day after he accused her husband of rape on Fox News this month, she told CNN, “I have concluded he is not qualified to be president. ” Her aides were exuberant that Mrs. Clinton, a cautious candidate who for weeks had demurred when asked if Mr. Trump was up to the job, had finally publicly declared him unfit. But to many Clinton allies, it felt like a tepid tactic from yesteryear. “Sometimes, you get the feeling that they’re in a professional boxing match and he’s in a street fight, and they’re coming in with their gloves on,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, expressing dismay over the Clinton operation’s apparent lack of appetite for combat. “This is a street fight with a guy with a razor and a broken   bottle,” he added, “and you’ve got to fight him like that. ” Ms. Palmieri said, “Each tactic we use is designed for a particular purpose to either engage the press or reach a certain audience. ” Any aggressive approach by Mrs. Clinton is potentially dangerous, however, because recent polls show she is viewed negatively by a majority of the electorate. The campaign says it intends to go after Mr. Trump more forcefully, particularly on national security and his business record, after June 7, when Mrs. Clinton is expected to officially clinch her party’s nomination. For now, her aides appear to be throwing ideas against a wall to see what sticks, including trying out different monikers after the Democratic National Committee’s “Dangerous Donald” flopped. An internal favorite is “Poor Donald,” with its implication that Mr. Trump, famously defensive about his net worth, is not nearly as wealthy as he lets on. Her advisers also say that a large percentage of voters have not yet paid attention to the details of the race and do not know about Mr. Trump’s business dealings or that he has refused to release his taxes. “It wouldn’t be a general election without some early   from Washington insiders,” said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager. He noted that the campaign had attacked Mr. Trump over the tax returns and for his “demeaning millions of Americans. ” “Our campaign has already shown the resolve to take him on and put him on defense in ways his Republican challengers never could,” Mr. Mook added. William M. Daley, Mr. Obama’s former White House chief of staff, attributed any early shortcomings in taking on Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton’s prolonged primary battle against Mr. Sanders. The period between the June 7 contests and the July convention will reshape the race, he said. To that end, Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton’s pollster and chief strategist, pointed out that at this stage in the 2008 primary battle against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama led Senator John McCain by only two percentage points. He went on to defeat Mr. McCain by 7. 2 percentage points. It is clear, however, that Democrats are no longer mocking Mr. Trump. Many of them seem determined instead to understand his appeal. In an interview on Friday, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said he had purchased and begun reading Mr. Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal. ” The governor said he remained confident that Mrs. Clinton would ultimately win, but added that “she has to be careful, because now he has momentum. ”"
26524,"Hillary Clinton’s Lead Has Shrunk, but She Still Has an Edge - The New York Times",New York Times,Nate Cohn and Toni Monkovic,M,2016-07-14,2016.0,7.0,,"Nate Cohn, The Upshot’s elections analyst, based in Washington, and Toni Monkovic, an Upshot editor in New York, discussed a big day of polling results, posting a lightly edited transcript of their written exchange.  Toni After a quiet period, the polls poured in over 24 hours. What are the big takeaways? Nate I think the quick ones are that Hillary Clinton’s standing has deteriorated a bit since last month, but that she still has an advantage. Toni Let’s start by looking at the bad news for her. The first polls of the day, from Quinnipiac, probably panicked a lot of Democrats. FLORIDA: Trump 42, Clinton 39 PENNSYLVANIA: Trump 43, Clinton 41 OHIO: Clinton 41, Trump 41 Nate Yeah, the Quinnipiac polls aren’t great for Clinton. Quinnipiac polling has generally tilted toward the G. O. P. all year, so it’s reasonable to suppose that Clinton’s standing in those states would be a bit better in other polls. But they’re still consistent with a narrower race than the one suggested by most polls over the last month. The    polls were in that category as well. Their   numbers were better for Clinton than the Quinnipiac surveys, but they were still weaker for Clinton than their past surveys. Toni  Despite that Republican lean from Quinnipiac, it’s not as if it’s a terrible pollster. Yes, it’s just one poll, but it can’t be dismissed. Nate Well, I do think their Republican lean is a bit concerning. They conduct a lot of polls and they have big samples. As a result, it’s unusually clear that they have a real Republican tilt. But it’s not really clear why they should tilt that way, and that gives me pause. That said, you’re right that the polls shouldn’t be dismissed: Add them to the average. Toni There’s another bit of bad news for Clinton. Again, the mantra is to focus on the polling average, not on one poll. In this case it’s the   poll. It hasn’t been released to the public as we write this Wednesday night, but it will be by the time this is published. It will show her tied with Trump, which is one of her worst recent national results. (Sure, Rasmussen had Trump up by 2, but that’s actually a rare poll that can be disregarded, as you wrote Wednesday.) Nate You certainly can’t dismiss the   poll: It’s a very   survey. And yes, you really can dismiss the Rasmussen poll (unlike Quinnipiac). But as you said, it’s best to focus on the average. Right now, the balance of data remains consistent with a modest Clinton lead. A single   poll showing a tied race isn’t enough to change that: If Clinton is up by, say, 3 or 4 points, you would expect a few   polls to show a very tight contest, while others would show a larger Clinton lead. It’s also possible that the   result is   and a wave of new data will confirm a closer race than the balance of recent evidence. I’m not sure we’ll get to find out, since the convention is just around the corner. Toni This is the speculative part of the program. Her lead is shrinking. Why? On the one hand, you have the rebuke from the F. B. I. director over the emails, and you also have a calamity in which an   killed five police officers in Dallas amid a sense of racial strife. On the other hand, Bernie Sanders endorsed her, although that was very recent (so it wasn’t captured by the polling). Nate Well, I think the F. B. I. is the easiest explanation. I wouldn’t discount racial tension, either. I’d note that Obama’s approval rating in Gallup dipped to 48 percent today, the lowest in a while. I’ll be interested to see whether other polls show that, too. Toni Stating the obvious, but there are more whites than   so   strife is not normally a political winner for Democrats. When we talk about whites favoring Trump, we tend to skip the explanation. Republicans have won whites for decades, but readers should take a look at Nick Confessore’s article for how Trump is taking white identity politics to a new level. Or read Jamelle Bouie in Slate, who’s been writing about this a lot. Nate I certainly agree that racial polarization would be bad for the Democrats. But Trump isn’t doing much better than Mitt Romney among white voters, if at all. He’s losing as many   white voters as he’s gaining among less educated white voters. I think Clinton’s polling numbers may be particularly vulnerable to these sorts of fluctuations in the media environment. She’s counting on the support of a lot of people who simply don’t like her very much. I’d guess a lot of them know, deep down, that they’ll support her eventually. But right now, the act of telling a pollster that they intend to support someone they don’t really want to support might be fairly agonizing. Toni Election 2016: “Fairly agonizing. ” That’s a great summation. Nate One further thought on this: I think it’s relevant that Clinton is falling in these polls more than Trump is gaining. Toni Why? Nate We know that these voters have supported Clinton, even if in modestly more favorable conditions. There’s no way to be sure they’ll return to her side, but surely they’re more likely to revert to her in a more neutral media climate than to support Trump. Toni And the email issue may not resonate quite as much four months from now, especially if Republicans batter it into the ground. Nate It might still resonate quite a bit, but it’s hard for it to resonate much more. I think it’s going to be interesting to see where she’s at after the convention, after she gets some strong character witnesses in President Obama and Elizabeth Warren. Toni Earlier, you mentioned, “I’m not sure we’ll get to find out” about a better measure of the race “since the convention is just around the corner. ” We’re heading into a “noisy” season with polling. Can you explain? Nate Generally, a candidate gets a “bounce” of a few points after a convention. This year, it’s pretty messy. The two conventions basically happen back to back. It’ll be hard to read too much into the polls for a few weeks with the conventions (unless Trump leads coming out of Clinton’s convention, which would obviously be a very strong sign for him). The good news, though, is that the polls start getting fairly accurate a few weeks after the conventions. So that’s something to look forward to. Toni Let’s turn to some of her positive results, and they got more positive as the day wore on. Colorado was particularly a bright spot. Fox had her up by 10 points, and Monmouth by 13. Nate Yeah, that’s a great result for her. It’s not hard to see why it could be a good state for her: It’s very well educated and it has an   Latino vote. The same story basically holds in Virginia, where the Fox poll also showed her doing well. And I think it’s worth remembering that Virginia and Colorado would basically be almost enough to get Clinton over the top. If you give her all of the states carried by Obama where she’s not airing advertisements (which includes Wisconsin and Pennsylvania) then Colorado and Virginia would get her to 269 electoral votes. It would only take one more, and she has a lot of options. It’s hard to look at the polling right now and say that Trump has a discernible edge in any battleground, even if a few  —   like Ohio and Iowa  —   look very close. Toni I was going to ask you about Ohio and Iowa. We’ve gotten quite a few polls from those states recently, and they seem dead even. Nate It does seem that way. Iowa and Ohio are two states where Democrats are heavily dependent on   white voters. Same story in Wisconsin, where Clinton was up by just 4 points today. In all three states, Clinton is running about 3 or 4 points worse than Obama four years ago. It’s kind of the reverse of Colorado and Virginia. Toni But a slight difference with Wisconsin it has been consistently leaning for Clinton. Nate True. My point is just that it’s a state where she’s underperforming Obama, unlike the states where Romney was more dependent on   voters like Colorado and Virginia. Toni The map you discussed supposes she’ll win Pennsylvania, and we had some divergent results in the state today. We also had this tidbit: Pennsylvania white voters: Trump, 40%  —   Clinton, 40% Pennsylvania black voters: Trump, 0%  —   Clinton, 91% It cannot be possible that Trump is getting 0 percent support from black voters. I mean, he made a big production of “my  ” a while back. Nate   well, he’s probably not actually getting zero percent of the black vote. But here, let’s use some data. I have this polling data from 2012 loaded on my computer. It’s 20, 000 interviews, or about 24 times more respondents than the    poll in Pennsylvania. In that data set, there are 1, 881 black respondents, and just 55 of them supported Romney. So in 2012 you would have expected there to be about two voters who were black and supported Mitt Romney in an     national poll. With numbers like that, you’re going to get more than a few polls where there are no black voters for the G. O. P. And here’s a flashback from 2012, from the   poll heading into the G. O. P. convention: Obama ahead   among black voters. Sound familiar? Toni That makes sense, but maybe you’re ruining it  —   the zero somehow seems more meaningful. (Like turning the stereo up to 11.) Nate Here’s something fun: In my data set, which includes 880 respondents from Pennsylvania, the black vote was   for Obama (and that’s with 60 black respondents). I don’t think it’s very meaningful. We know that Clinton is up by a huge margin among black voters. There are going to be polls where Trump gets zero black voters. Toni One thing that’s very meaningful is whether Clinton can win Pennsylvania. You mentioned one overall path to victory, through Colorado and Virginia. It’s also true that if the Democrats hold onto Pennsylvania and win Virginia and Florida, it’s essentially game over. But we didn’t learn that much from the Pennsylvania results today, did we? Nate No, it was a split decision, with Quinnipiac showing a tight race and    showing a considerable Clinton lead. I’m inclined to lean toward    considering that the Clinton campaign isn’t taking Pennsylvania especially seriously [no ad spending, although a   super PAC is spending money there]. But it’d be nice to have more data there. Toni It was a rich day of polling. If you had to assess Clinton’s national lead right now, what would you say, 3 points? Four points? That’s a pretty close race against a candidate who has struggled in  many ways. Nate  I’d probably say 4 or 5 points, but that’s not very  . The newest data does provide reason to pause and wonder whether the race has gotten even tighter, even if the preponderance of evidence doesn’t point that way quite yet. The only other thing I’d say, though, is that we know Clinton has had a rough week or two. The polls are going to bump around, and I think there’s reason to think this is a relatively low point. On Wednesday, Nate and Toni looked at the groups Donald Trump would win if the election were held today. "
208889,Hillary Clinton’s campaign raised $55 million in the latest fundraising quarter,Washington Post,Anne Gearan,F,2016-01-01,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160102012843/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/01/hillary-clintons-campaign-raised-55-million-in-the-latest-fundraising-quarter/
","     Hillary Clinton’s campaign announced Friday that it raised $55 million in the final fundraising period of 2015, and $112 million in   funds for the year. Clinton brought in $37 million in money specifically for use in the primary during the fourth quarter of 2015. Clinton also raised $3 million for the general election. Her annual total is the most for any   in a   year and roughly equal to what President Obama raised as a sitting president ahead of the 2012 election, the campaign said. The totals are further evidence of the Democratic  ’s   muscle, despite public fretting from her campaign that the numbers might slip or that challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders might   her. The campaign had set a 2015 goal of $100 million for use during the primary period. The campaign exceeded that, leaving about $38 million in the bank. The Iowa caucuses are a month away, meaning heavier travel and more expensive advertising and other costs as the primary fight with Sanders nears its first test. Clinton kept up a steep burn rate in the fourth quarter, racing through nearly $33 million    almost 86 percent of the $37 million she raised over the last three months for her campaign. That’s up from the more than $25 million she spent in the third quarter of the year, when she raised $29. 4 million and spent 86 percent of it. Overall, Clinton spent more than $76 million last year, with huge investments in digital technology and an    network of organizers. It remains to be seen how her resources compare with those of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who nearly matched her fundraising in the fall, bringing in $26. 2 million. His campaign’s burn rate in the third quarter was half of Clinton’s. For the first time since she entered the 2016 race last April, Clinton raised money for a general election contest as well, bringing in $1 million for her own campaign’s use and $18 million for the Democratic Party in the fourth quarter. Most of that came from a single     event in New York last month. ”Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have joined together and powered this historic campaign, we are now heading into Iowa and New Hampshire with the resources we need to be successful,” said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. The Clinton campaign shilled hard in recent days, emailing supporters in the names of Bill and Chelsea Clinton, among others, to ask for   donations. Clinton’s own name was on one such appeal to Democrats titled, ”If We Lose.” Political contributions logged through midnight on Dec. 31 count for the fourth quarter and for the 2015 year. The figures released by the campaign will be included in a more detailed report due to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31. Supporters are limited to donations of $2, 700 apiece for the primary period, and most of the fundraising parties Clinton attends are geared to bringing in that maximum contribution from each attendee. The Clinton campaign said, however, that 94 percent  of donations in the fourth quarter arrived in increments of $100 or less. The campaign also said that more than 60 percent of donors for the year were women. Related: Inside the Clinton donor network Why so many women are raising money for Hillary Clinton"
208925,Heckler disrupts Hillary Clinton town hall over Bill Clinton’s sexual history,Washington Post,Abby Phillip,F,2016-01-03,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160104002408/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/03/heckler-disrupts-hillary-clinton-town-hall-over-bill-clintons-sexual-history/
","     DERRY, N. H.  —   One day before former president Bill Clinton arrives in New Hampshire to campaign for his wife, Hillary Clinton, she was confronted with questions about allegations involving his sexual history at a town hall meeting in the state on Sunday. State Rep. Katherine  ’Brien (R) repeatedly interrupted Clinton during the meeting, which was held in a middle school gymnasium.  ’Brien has for years followed the former first lady, peppering her with questions about allegations of past sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton. The state lawmaker’s outbursts startled an otherwise friendly town hall audience. It is unclear whether Clinton was able to hear her comments. After  ’Brien’s third interruption, Clinton responded angrily: ”You are very rude, and I’m not ever going to call on you.” Later,  ’Brien told reporters that she wanted to raise the issue of Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual misconduct and was incensed by ”the hypocrisy of the   women fighting for women.” The allegations of misconduct that have swirled around the former president for years have reemerged in the campaign recently, thanks to GOP businessman Donald Trump, who has said that those allegations are fair game on the campaign trail."
208952,Hillary Clinton is the most miscast figure on the 2016 political stage,Washington Post,Ed Rogers,M,2016-01-04,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160104234219/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/01/04/hillary-clinton-is-the-most-miscast-figure-on-the-2016-political-stage/
","     With all the noise and bluster coming from the Republican campaign, suggesting dysfunction among the Republican candidates, the fact is, Hillary Clinton is the most miscast character in the 2016 race. This is shaping up to be a change election, and nothing about a Clinton candidacy offers change. Period. While Republicans are engaged in a noisy, boisterous process that is at the very least compelling to watch, the Democrats appear to be letting Clinton sleepwalk them into the doldrums of a campaign that will not be able to channel the emotions of the electorate. Her campaign will only feed the malaise that many voters feel and won’t do anything to create the enthusiastic wave to turn out Democrats in the numbers she will need to repeat President Obama’s 2008 and 2012 victories. Poll after poll indicates voter dissatisfaction, with a vast majority of voters believing our country is headed in the wrong direction, and a sense that anger at the governing establishment is the prevailing emotion. It looks like the forces of change are gathering  —   and among today’s presidential candidates, on either side, Clinton is the biggest mismatch for today’s zeitgeist. That is particularly true among Republican and independent voters, but even some Democrats are questioning Clinton’s suitability. Just look at the phenomenal success of oddball Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) who is drawing enthusiastic support from the left wing of the Democratic Party, as well as the stunning news that Ron Burkle, a billionaire Democrat and Hillary ’08 supporter, has abandoned Clinton for John Kasich’s presidential campaign. Clearly, Clinton is missing the moment  —   yet, somehow, she is also the only candidate practically guaranteed a spot in the finals this November. When you think about the state of the economy, the dysfunction of our foreign policy and the growing partisanship in our country, it’s not hard to see why Clinton appears so out of step. On our anemic economy, Clinton would be an Obama 2. 0; she doesn’t even pretend to be something different or new. She is promising more of the usual Democratic freebies to more people. Nothing about her policies would stimulate robust growth; she barely even uses the word “growth. ” Obama’s weakening of America’s place in the world has caused anxiety about our national security, and Clinton can’t disassociate herself from our foreign policy debacles. And in the specific instance of Libya, where Clinton was in charge, look what that got us. No one on the left or right thinks U. S. involvement in Libya is a formula for success in the future. Not to mention, at home, like Obama, Clinton is a divisive figure. She regularly calls Republicans her enemies, even comparing Republicans to “terrorist groups”; she buys into conspiracy theories that allow her to blame others for her mistakes; and she surrounds herself with partisan sycophants. There is no case to be made that Clinton is a refreshing change, that she has the answers and the leadership abilities to not only bring the country together but also to reverse the chaos abroad that threatens the United States today. If Washington doesn’t work now, Clinton is not going to bring a new leadership style, energy or fresh appeal to the White House to change anything. At least when Bill Clinton ran for president, he was credible as a “New Democrat. ” Clinton can’t try to make the claim that she is a “new” anything. Clinton can’t successfully play the woman card because she is so clumsy in doing so. Instead of allowing voters to determine for themselves that she is a woman, oddly, she seems to constantly need to remind everyone of that fact. She wants voters to believe that she has some unique or enhanced capacity to lead on “women’s issues,” but both Donald Trump’s latest attacks and the Bill Cosby scandal have reawakened the public’s interest in several old sex scandals and in the process, this has compromised Clinton’s credibility. Both show us that the statute of limitations on sexual harassment  —   both legally and in the public relations realm  —   is a long one. We are reminded that when Clinton had an opportunity to stand up against workplace sexual harassment, she herself became an attack dog against the victim and an enabler for the perpetrator. At the end of the day, the issue won’t drive many votes, but it is a stark reminder of Clinton’s cynicism and hypocrisy. The bottom line is that if voters are looking for change, there is no affirmative case to be made for electing Hillary Clinton as president. So what is she to do? Simple. She will need to attack the Republican nominee. 2016 may be the most vicious campaign ever, as Clinton has to make the Republican candidate unacceptable. Arguably, Republicans could do their part by nominating a candidate who will be hard to swallow. But the Clinton forces don’t have a choice. And actually, given her limited presentation skills, it is a campaign strategy that will suit her. The Empire will go negative and do so early. So while Americans are looking for peace, prosperity, a booming economy, a robust and assertive national security, a return to competent governing and to be given confidence about the future, all they will get from Clinton and the Democrats are scare tactics, crocodile tears and outright lies about Republicans. Welcome to the 2016 campaign."
209029,Planned Parenthood will make unprecedented primary endorsement of Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Abby Phillip,F,2016-01-07,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160108032704/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/07/planned-parenthood-will-make-unprecedented-primary-endorsement-of-hillary-clinton/
","     PASADENA, CALIF.    The political arm of Planned Parenthood will endorse Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire on Sunday, a Clinton campaign official confirmed. The endorsement marks the first time in the organization’s   history that Planned Parenthood Action Fund has endorsed a candidate in a primary. The endorsement was first reported by CBS News. “Let’s be clear  —   reproductive rights and health are on the ballot in 2016,” said Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards. “We’re proud to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.  ”No other candidate in our nation’s history has demonstrated such a strong commitment to women or such a clear record on behalf of women’s health and rights,” she added. ”This is about so much more than Planned Parenthood. Health care for an entire generation is at stake. ” Planned Parenthood is one of the nation’s leading providers of abortions and reproductive health services. Its early endorsement of Clinton will effectively mobilize supporters    and millions of dollars    nationwide for her candidacy. Richard is expected to officially announce the endorsement at an event on Sunday in Manchester that kicks off the Action Fund’s efforts in the 2016 election season.    During a rally in St. Louis, Mo. on Dec. 11, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she will defend Planned Parenthood, along with a number of civil rights. ”I will defend a woman’s right to choose and I will defend Planned Parenthood,” Clinton said to a cheering crowd. (Reuters)   Clinton has vocally said she will defend the organization from what she has characterized as partisan attacks by Republicans in Congress. ”As a lifelong Planned Parenthood supporter, I’m honored to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund,” Clinton said in a statement. ”There has never been a more important election when it comes to women’s health and reproductive rights —  and Planned Parenthood’s patients, providers, and advocates across the country are a crucial line of defense against the dangerous agenda being advanced by every Republican candidate for president.” The organization has been under fire for months, after a slew of undercover videos alleged that Planned Parenthood had illegally sold fetal tissue, an accusation it has denied. But Republicans have not relented. This week, the House and Senate    both controlled by Republicans    passed legislation to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. President Obama is expected to veto the legislation.   [Congress sends health care repeal to Obama, setting up certain veto]   ”This week was a jarring reminder of what’s at stake in 2016,” Clinton added in a statement. ”Thankfully, President Obama will exercise his veto power to stop the Republicans from cutting off women, men, and young people from vital health care services at Planned Parenthood —  including cancer screenings,   exams, and STI and HIV tests —  and taking away health coverage from 18 million people. ”Any of the Republican candidates will proudly sign that bill into law if they win,” she added. Planned Parenthood said it expects to spend more than $20 million supporting its candidates in the 2016 election    the most ever in one cycle."
209047,Heidi Cruz is the high-powered political spouse we’ve rarely seen since Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Katie Zezima,F,2016-01-08,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160109004723/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/meet-heidi-cruz-hard-charging-career-woman-but-first-a-loyal-spouse/2016/01/07/bf822444-9dee-11e5-a3c5-c77f2cc5a43c_story.html
"," When Heidi and Ted Cruz came to the Atlanta suburbs to campaign a few weeks ago, she perfectly played the role of political spouse: a loving gaze for her husband as he spoke, hands on the shoulders of their two daughters, beaming smiles for supporters. A few days earlier during a solo swing through Missouri, Heidi Cruz made clear that her other identity  —     career woman with ambitions of her own  —   was never far from her mind. “I want to tell you, I did take a leave of absence from work,” she told her audience, standing among shiny motorcycles on the sales floor of a   dealership. “I wouldn’t have given up my job and the time with my girls if I did not really believe in my heart that Ted Cruz would win this election. ”  No one has taken on more roles in the Cruz campaign than Heidi Cruz. Most visibly, she is the traditional campaign spouse. But she is also her husband’s chief fundraiser, a surrogate who hopscotches across the country asking voters, one    at a time, for their support  —   and in private meetings imploring political and faith leaders for theirs. They are all new roles for Heidi Cruz. On leave from her career at Goldman Sachs in Houston, she has embarked on a journey unlike any she has navigated before  —   rearranging her entire life and applying her own substantial experience to serve the ambitions of her husband.   Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) with his wife, Heidi, and their daughters, Catherine and Caroline, as he announces his candidacy for president at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. on March, 23, 2015. (Chris  )  Cruz is not the only Republican spouse this cycle with notable professional accomplishments. Mary Pat Christie was a longtime bond trader before quitting after her husband declared his candidacy, and she, too, has helped raise money. Karen Kasich spent nearly 20 years working in public relations, and Frank Fiorina was a telecommunications executive. But the more apt comparison for Heidi Cruz may be Hillary Clinton. Since Clinton’s years as a campaign partner and first lady, few political spouses have redirected their own ambitions to the degree that Heidi Cruz has this cycle. And few since Clinton, now trying to follow her husband into the White House, have demonstrated as Heidi Cruz has the kind of political talent and experience of her own to prompt speculation among those who hear her speak that she, too, could some day be a formidable candidate.   [Ted Cruz promises conservative Iowa something it’s never had: A nominee]  Shortly after former Texas governor Rick Perry left the contest, a group of Perry donors torn between Cruz and former Florida governor Jeb Bush  —   and others who weren’t even sure whether they wanted to donate any more money this election cycle  —   met over breakfast. It was a way for Cruz to make his pitch to a   audience, but there was a snag: He got stuck in Washington at the last minute because of Senate votes. The host, Mica Mosbacher, called Heidi Cruz.  She charmed the audience with talk both personal and strategic. She left with converts. Mosbacher said a doctor who attended was not sure whether she liked Ted Cruz. She listened to Heidi Cruz and wrote a check.  “I got a lot of emails and calls that it was Heidi who did it,” Mosbacher said. “They said, ‘If he’s married to her. . . . ’ ”    Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) his wife, Heidi, and their daughters, Caroline and Catherine, appear at a campaign event in Kennesaw, Ga. on Dec. 18, 2015. (Erik S.   Pressphoto Agency)  Welcome Wilson Sr. a wealthy Cruz donor, knew Heidi Cruz from Houston’s business community; the two sat on the board of the Greater Houston Partnership. She called him and told him the reasons that she thought the campaign would win. They included the campaign’s robust ground game. She told him that Cruz would be leading in the polls in Iowa in December, a statement that he found “outrageous” but which ended up being true.  “She is the most dynamic female I have ever met, and I mean that,” he said. “She is on point and relentless. ”  Cruz, 43, grew up in San Luis Obispo, Calif. the daughter of a dentist and dental hygienist who are   Adventists. When she was 5, Heidi’s parents signed her up for piano lessons, and she insisted on practicing an hour and sometimes two each night. At age 8, when her parents first enrolled her in school, a family trip to Washington sparked an interest in politics. By fifth grade, Heidi announced she wanted to go to Harvard Business School.  “I don’t even know how she knew about Harvard Business School. It wasn’t in our world at all,” her mother, Suzanne Nelson, said in an interview. “A good word to describe her is ‘driven.’ I don’t really know what has made her so driven. ” She attended high school at Monterey Bay Academy, an Adventist school in Northern California with a   private beach and strict rules about curfews and interactions between boys and girls. Heidi Nelson was preppy, popular and always studying.  One year, she ran for student body president. Her campaign poster read, “Heidi Nelson, the auspicious choice,” according to classmate Travis Romero.  “I asked her, ‘Nobody knows what the word auspicious is,’ ” Romero said. “She said, ‘Isn’t that great? You get an extra word for your SATs.’ ”  Despite the slogan, Cruz lost. Romero said he endearingly thought of Cruz when he watched the movie “Election,” in which Reese Witherspoon plays an overachieving student running for class president.  Cruz went to Claremont McKenna College and was active in the college Republicans and interested in appointive political office, said her mentor, Edward Haley. She also was intent on a career in business first. She moved to New York after graduation and worked on emerging markets at J. P. Morgan, an area in which she was interested after spending summers in Africa doing missionary work with her parents. She was put on the Latin America desk and taught herself to speak Spanish between   work days.  Cruz achieved her dream of attending Harvard Business School but turned down a job at Goldman Sachs to work on George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential campaign. She told the New York Times in 2001 that she had just broken up with a boyfriend of two years. She planned to “forget boys” and “kill myself on the campaign. ” Instead, she met Ted Cruz, who by his own admission turned off campaign colleagues with what he described as a “cocky” attitude. But not Heidi Nelson. She said he reminded her of “a 1950s movie star. ” He grilled her on her hopes, aspirations and dreams during their first date. They were married the following year.  She was the star when the couple arrived in Washington, netting jobs at the Treasury Department and then the White House, working as a Latin America director on the National Security Council. Ted Cruz was floundering, and he moved back to Texas to become the state’s solicitor general with hopes of launching a political career. They lived apart for more than a year, until she gave up her job and moved to Texas.  After the move, she suffered through a period of depression. “When I moved to Texas, it really was for Ted, and I wasn’t comfortable with that,” she told The Washington Post in September. She said she recovered with spiritual counseling. She started working at Goldman Sachs in Houston; she was promoted to managing director. And she began to apply her talents to her husband’s political career. Heidi Cruz comes off as breezy and fun, chatting with women as if they are old girlfriends, making liberal use of the word “awesome” and doling out hugs to just about anyone who comes her way  —   the opposite of her husband, who is known for throwing rhetorical bombs.  “Stylistically, I can soften him a little bit,” said Cruz, clad in navy leggings and black flats, with Roberto Cavalli sunglasses perched atop her blond hair.  She now holds her own campaign events, talking up her husband’s values and laying out what the campaign sees as a   path to victory. She speaks clearly but sometimes haltingly in speeches, and is more comfortable working the crowd, complimenting a young girl in Missouri on her butterfly shirt.  She remains the campaign’s top fundraiser, now making many calls from the road instead of from the campaign’s airy Houston headquarters, where she installed a playroom with pillows decorated with raspberry prints for the girls. Cruz said she aims to make 30 calls a day but typically averages about 20 to 25; she is calling from the campaign and super PAC lists and trying to persuade donors to give the maximum allowed under federal election law.  “I don’t want to say it’s easy, and I don’t close every deal,” she said. “I think people want to be a part of something that addresses the main issue of the day, number one, which is Washington versus the people. ” She tries to frame the chance people have to support her husband, whether with time, money or a vote, as an investment opportunity. She said she is not hitting up Wall Street.  Ted Cruz told an audience in Winterset, Iowa, on Monday that the couple’s decision to run for president was difficult for his wife.  “Heidi spent a lot of years building a very, very successful career. And when we were deciding whether to run, particularly when you’re parents of young girls, that’s not an easy decision. And she was struggling with it,” he said. Ted Cruz said his wife was driving, listening to a CD of Christian music sent by her   . She was struck by a song about seeking the face of the Lord and pulled over on the freeway and started crying, he said. That moment, he said, “changed her heart,” and she decided that the race was about God, the country and the future.  Now, Heidi Cruz says her main job is to bolster her husband’s candidacy.  “There are women who use their husband’s candidacies for their own” purposes, she said recently while being driven to yet another airport. “I love my life. I love my career. This is not for me. This is for our country. ” "
209109,The scenario that could become a nightmare for Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-01-10,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160111002457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-fantasy-scenario-that-could-become-reality-for-clinton/2016/01/10/085496a6-b7d6-11e5-829c-26ffb874a18d_story.html
"," Close your eyes for a minute and imagine it’s Feb. 10. In the past nine days, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) has beaten his Democratic presidential challenger Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. There won’t be another vote for 10 more days (Nevada) and then it’ll be another week until South Carolina, the last of the big four early states, votes. That scenario would be a total nightmare for Clinton. Period. It’s also a lot more likely to go from fantasy to reality than most people  —   including most establishment Democrats  —   understand.  Consider two polls conducted by NBC and Marist College in Iowa and New Hampshire that were released Sunday. In Iowa, Clinton has 48 percent, Sanders has 45 percent and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley has 5 percent. In New Hampshire, it’s Sanders in the lead with 50 percent, with 46 percent for Clinton and 1 percent for O’Malley. Even if you accept that these surveys are a snapshot in time and take a step back to look at the broader polling picture, the idea of a Sanders’s sweep of the first two states remains plausible. In Iowa, Clinton’s lead on Sanders is 10 points, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polling conducted in the race. In New Hampshire, Sanders’s lead over Clinton is just shy of five points, according the RCP polling average. There’s little question that Iowa is the tougher nut to crack of the two states for Sanders. Although Clinton finished third in the state in the 2008 Democratic primary, she and her team have worked extremely hard to ensure that she is well organized and well funded in the state to avoid a repeat of that performance. Sanders, given his strong liberal positions on, well, almost everything  —   including his early opposition to the war in Iraq  —   should endear him to liberals who tend to comprise a large chunk of the caucus electorate. In 2008, by way of comparison, a majority of Iowa Democrats in the caucus exit poll identified themselves as either “very” (18 percent) or “somewhat” (34 percent) liberal. In New Hampshire, Sanders has steadily run ahead of Clinton. Of the past 10 polls in the state, Clinton has led just three  —   and never by anything outside of the surveys’ margins of error. Clinton allies have long insisted that Sanders’s geographic proximity to New Hampshire makes him naturally competitive in the state. And, they argue, a Sanders victory in the state would effectively be a “favorite son” situation  —   rendering it largely meaningless. But,    wins in Iowa and New Hampshire would make it impossible for the Clinton team to make that case credibly. Sanders wouldn’t be a   phenomenon; he would be   in    matchups against the heavy favorite to be the Democratic nominee. Now, I know what you are thinking. Even if Sanders wins Iowa and New Hampshire, Clinton is still in fine shape because the rest of the calendar is made up of much more racially diverse states  —   Nevada on Feb. 20, South Carolina on Feb. 27 and so on and so forth  —   where Clinton runs far better than Sanders. True! But remember that politics is a changeable business. And that most normal voters (still) aren’t paying much attention to the process. If Sanders won the first two states, is it that hard to believe that the race could fundamentally shift  —   and not in a good way for Clinton  —   in the 10 days between New Hampshire and Nevada?  To me, the idea that the race is totally upended is at least as likely as the notion that Sanders winning the first two states wouldn’t affect much of anything in the states that followed. Clinton and her team are very aware of the peril inherent in their present situation. She has launched an aggressive attack on a 2005 Sanders vote in favor of giving immunity to gun manufacturers, a strategy clearly designed to take some of the shine off the senator from Vermont in the eyes of Iowa liberals.  “I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote, which the National Rifle Association hailed as the most important in 20 years, points at a clear difference,” Clinton said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday. “It’s a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account. ” The political reality for Clinton goes like this: If she wins Iowa, she almost certainly could weather a New Hampshire loss and go on to win the nomination. But, if Clinton comes up short in Iowa, look out. We could be in for a longer  —   and more competitive  —   race than anyone expects. "
209152,What do we want Hillary Clinton to do about her husband?,Washington Post,Alyssa Rosenberg,F,2016-01-12,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160113011555/http://washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/01/12/what-do-we-want-hillary-clinton-to-do-about-her-husband/
","     Bill Clinton’s sexual misadventures have never quite vanished as a national story. But in recent weeks, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has called renewed attention to them, and Juanita Broaddrick, who in 1999 said Bill Clinton had raped her in 1978, has renewed those allegations. Both because the case is past the statute of limitations in Arkansas and because Hillary Clinton is running for president now on a platform that includes greater support for rape victims, the headlines have become more about Hillary Clinton than about her husband, the man who actually has been accused of misconduct. But though the circumstances are different, the question remains the same: What is it we want Hillary Clinton to do about her husband? Because however unfair or incoherent that desire is, Americans seem to want her to do something. In a great post published last week, my colleague Greg Sargent got at the incoherence that lies behind the idea that Bill Clinton’s sexual history is “fair game” during the 2016 presidential election. Does “fair game” mean that “Bill Clinton’s past sexual indiscretions are a legitimate topic for political debate in and of themselves, as a way of discrediting Bill Clinton, in his capacity as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton, a role which he is undoubtedly playing? Or does it mean that,” Sargent asked, “Bill Clinton’s past sexual indiscretions are a legitimate weapon to use against Hillary Clinton, which is to say, as something that undermines Hillary Clinton’s claim to being a lifelong advocate for women and her argument that her policies are better for women than those of Republicans are?” Rebecca Traister, answering the latter assumption and examining the Clinton marriage in the context of the saga of Camille and Bill Cosby, traced the long history of making women responsible for the private lives and private acts of their very public husbands. “The position she is being put in is emblematic of the double binds placed on wives in all kinds of circumstances,” Traister wrote. “Husbands act; wives react to them. Husbands behave poorly; people look to wives for explanations of why. Wives pay prices for goods they never bought; they do time in publicity hell for actions they never took; they receive judgments for crimes they did not commit. They are offered impossible choices: Do they condemn their partners and thereby destroy the legacies and legitimacy they have helped to build, and if they do not, do they become culpable in those partners’ misdeeds?” If we haven’t been able to articulate that in real life, fiction has imagined a number of ways Hillary Clinton might deal with her more frustrating half. In both Joe Klein’s initially anonymous novel “Primary Colors” and the Mike Nichols 1998 film adaptation of the book, the answer seems to be that we’d like the satisfaction of knowing that Hillary Clinton is a mess. In “Primary Colors,” the   for the Clintons are Jack and Susan Stanton (John Travolta and Emma Thompson) and their transgressions are rather more baroque than even the most dramatic things Bill Clinton has actually been accused of. Jack carries on an affair with Susan’s hairdresser. He sleeps with the    daughter of a family friend, and when she becomes pregnant, there is some suggestion that Jack might be the father. Susan has sex with a campaign aide, Henry Burton (Adrian Lester) as revenge. And it later emerges that she has sometimes slept with Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) the family’s wartime consigliere, in similar moments of emotional pain. Nobody in the novel seems to want Susan to leave Jack; at the beginning of the novel, her faith in him is part of what makes Jack seem intellectually credible. And for much of the novel, their marriage seems, from the outside, to be defined by what Henry refers to as “the mysterious emotional concavity of their bond: the most blatant transgressions often had to be ignored. ” But as Jack’s flaws become too obvious for us, and for Henry, to deny, Susan takes on a different role in the action. Now, her job is to be the person who acknowledges that terrible things have taken place, but that Jack is still worth supporting anyway. She slaps her husband, she comforts the mother of the young girl Jack had sex with, she has revenge sex of her own. Susan punishes Jack so that we don’t have to, and she suffers along with us. She’s the bridge between our moral horror over Jack’s actions and our emotional desire to fall for his charm and promise. “Political Animals,” Greg Berlanti’s spritely 2012 miniseries, follows a former first lady, Elaine Barrish (Sigourney Weaver) who must confront her choice to stay with her philandering husband, Bud (Ciarán Hinds) after she loses her own run for the presidency. If “Primary Colors” was primarily concerned with Jack Stanton’s political fate, “Political Animals” prioritizes Elaine, its Hillary Clinton  . If Susan had to stay with Jack to get him elected, “Political Animals” sees Bud as dead weight on Elaine’s promising career and   sexual charisma. She dumps him, becomes secretary of state, flirts with foreign diplomats  —   and seizes her second chance at the presidency when it comes along. Bud’s philandering doesn’t have victims, as far as we can tell; there’s no abuse of power, no allegations of statutory rape or rape. Rather, the question is one of  : Why would a woman like Elaine  —   or Hillary Clinton  —   stay with a man who keeps putting her in a position to be embarrassed, who drags his mud all over her outstanding promise? These questions might be easier to answer in fiction than in life, but only marginally. The only sure thing is that Hillary and Bill Clinton chose each other a long time ago and have been choosing each other ever since. What we project onto their relationship says as much about us, and how our thinking about marriage and gender roles has changed, as it does about the Clintons’ private feelings and compromises. And given how exposed and examined the Clintons have been during their decades in the national spotlight, that’s the only thing about them that may remain forever mysterious."
209154,How a Sanders surge may help Hillary Clinton — if it doesn’t bring her down first,Washington Post,Greg Sargent,M,2016-01-12,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160113011555/http://washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/01/12/how-a-sanders-surge-may-help-hillary-clinton-if-it-doesnt-bring-her-down-first/
","     The smart Beltway money has suddenly decided, based on a handful of polls, that we’ve got ourselves a real race on the Democratic side. A new Monmouth University poll finds Bernie Sanders leading Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire among likely Democratic primary voters by  . Meanwhile, a new Quinnipiac poll finds Sanders leading Clinton in Iowa by   among likely Democratic  . A new Public Policy Polling survey puts Clinton up in Iowa by   but that’s a tightening, and the polling averages clearly suggest a tightening in Iowa as well. So Sanders may well be surging. We’ll know more tomorrow, when the Des Moines Register poll  —   the gold standard in Iowa polling  —   is set to drop. But in the event that the Sanders surge continues, but doesn’t take down Clinton  —   and a Clinton loss by no means can be ruled out  —   it could prove a good thing for her candidacy. Nate Silver is taking Sanders’ surge in Iowa seriously: It’s probably worth being at least a little bit skeptical of a polling swing like this one without any major news events to precipitate it. But here’s the thing: You can make the case that Sanders was underachieving in Iowa before. As we’ve been saying since July, it’s entirely plausible that Sanders could win the state. From a   level, the demographics of the Democratic caucuses here should look pretty similar to those of the New Hampshire primary. Meaning there will be lots of white liberals. And while Sanders doesn’t have the advantage in Iowa of hailing from a neighboring state, as he does in New Hampshire, he has some other things working for him here: lots of college students and caucuses that rely heavily on voter enthusiasm, which could make his ground game more important. If Sanders doesn’t win Iowa, and Clinton pulls out a win, it will mostly offset a Sanders victory in New Hampshire, and then it’s on to the later contests, where more diverse electorates will probably give Clinton and her broader coalition a substantial advantage. So it’s all about Iowa. But Sanders could win there. If he does, and if he goes on to win New Hampshire, it’s perfectly possible that it could shift the dynamic in other states. It’s a strange year. Predictions are perhaps even more perilous than usual. But as Silver has also documented, it’s also perfectly possible that Sanders could win both early contests and go on to lose the nomination by losing pretty much everywhere else. That’s largely because Clinton performs very well among minority voters, and you would probably have to see a massive exodus of them from Clinton to Sanders for him to win the nomination. Make no mistake: A Sanders win in both early states would unleash gale force winds of pundit   for Clinton. But Dem voters in the later contests may not play along. And if Clinton does go on to win later contests, and the nomination, a stiff Sanders challenge along the way could prove all to the good for her. The structure of this primary so far has not been uniformly beneficial to Clinton. The Democratic National Committee set up too few debates, on a schedule that helped guarantee a smaller audience, that  —   intended or not  —   may have served to insulate Clinton from high profile challenges. This has not served Clinton well. She has been at her best when directly challenged in high stakes settings, such as during the debates we did have and during the marathon showdown with Benghazi committee Republicans in the fall. Exposure and challenge have been good for Clinton. If Clinton had wrapped up the nomination with little challenge, it might have spared the Clinton campaign and top Democrats who support her some tense moments. But a serious battle for the nomination could end up offering more upside than downside. As one senior Democrat remarked to me earlier today, daily political combat hones campaigns. It forces them to respond and innovate and deal with crises. It pushes them out of their comfort zones. It forces candidates to make arguments and to grow. Clinton, if she wins the nomination, could very well face either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. Laugh all you want about Trump’s buffoonery, and scoff all you want about Cruz’s   extremism, but both of them are brutal and unpredictable on the attack. (Marco Rubio is said to be a political killer, too, but it’s not clear to me that we know what he’s really made of yet.) Whether it is Trump or Cruz  —   and quite possibly if it is Rubio  —   the GOP nominee will run a very tough campaign against Clinton. Just look at what we’re seeing now. The Clinton campaign  —   nervous about the growing Sanders threat  —   is kicking things into high gear. It has been aggressively challenging Sanders’ record on guns. It released the first piece of her tax plan yesterday, a proposal to hit those who earn over $5 million per year with a tax surcharge. Per reporting from Jennifer Epstein and Jonathan Cohn, the Clinton camp today rolled out two more pieces of this plan, a call for expanding the estate tax and a call to close various loopholes employed by the wealthy. This is a campaign that’s fighting hard. That’s a good thing for it. To repeat, the possibility that Sanders could pull off an upset cannot be dismissed  —   not at all. But if she does hang on to win amid difficult circumstances, a serious, sustained and spirited Sanders challenge could make Clinton and her campaign stronger and better for it.  "
209217,Carly Fiorina’s outrageously sexist attack on Hillary Clinton is the worst yet,Washington Post,Ruth Marcus,F,2016-01-15,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160116003331/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/carly-fiorinas-outrageously-sexist-attack-on-hillary-clinton-is-the-worst-yet/2016/01/15/5ec62f4c-bbb2-11e5-b682-4bb4dd403c7d_story.html
"," Carly Fiorina has dwindled to   irrelevance in the Republican primary field, as illustrated by her demotion to the undercard debate. But Fiorina, piping up from the kiddie table Thursday, said something so calculatedly outrageous that it demands response: “Unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband. ” This reference to Hillary Clinton was no gaffe. It was in Fiorina’s opening statement, in response to a question about the economy. In a campaign that has, so far, been blessedly free of sexism toward the Democratic   this was the most retro, sexist remark yet, at least where Clinton is concerned.   Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive   Facebook RSS   Shame on Fiorina. I wrote recently that it was fair game for Donald Trump to raise the subject of Bill Clinton’s conduct toward women, when Hillary Clinton had both dispatched her husband as surrogate in chief and attacked Trump’s undisputed “penchant for sexism. ”  Any campaign surrogate’s past remarks and behavior are fair game  —   a former president’s surely are  especially when they stand in contradiction to the candidate’s message. Bill Clinton’s philandering is between him and his wife, not a legitimate topic for campaign commentary. His inappropriate, arguably even predatory, behavior toward women is. That distinction explains and underscores why Fiorina’s comment was so out of line. What does she know of the Clintons’ marriage? What does anyone know about another person’s marriage? Fiorina says she loves spending time with her husband, and great for her, but she has no clue  —   none  —   about whether Hillary Clinton loves spending time with hers.  For what it’s worth, I believe Clinton deeply loves her husband, which explains her decision to stay with him  —   a choice that conservatives should applaud, not disdain. But I also believe that how they feel about one another, and how much time they spend together, is none of our business. Just like Trump’s multiple marriages.  In   television appearances, Fiorina flailed around in the muck when called on to justify her remark. Why hadn’t she questioned the state of other candidates’ marriages, asked Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s “Hardball. ” Fiorina: “There’s only two women running for president. I’m one, and Mrs. Clinton is the other. ” Um, but other candidates are married, aren’t they? Only the wives are relevant? On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday, Fiorina offered a different   for raising the subject: “Bill and Hillary Clinton have craved power their entire lives. ” The Huffington Post’s Sam Stein: “Why even go to the point that you’re criticizing her marriage?” Fiorina: “Well, I guess I would say, you know, if my husband had done some of the things Bill Clinton had done, I would have left him long ago. ” Stein, in a tone of disbelief: “Why is that a campaign issue?” Fiorina: “Oh, I think if you’re running for the presidency of the United States, everything’s an issue. . . . If you’re going to lead, people have to trust you, and in order to trust you, they have to know you. So, yes, I think it’s all fair game. ” Whoa. It’s one thing for a voter to decide for herself whether to think well or ill of Clinton for staying in her marriage. It’s quite another for a rival candidate to deploy that decision  —   or in Fiorina’s case, to make smarmy insinuations about the state of the Clinton marriage  —   against her.  Which brings us to the rampant sexism embedded in Fiorina’s comments. First, she feels empowered by her gender to go after another woman in a way that a male candidate would not. Second, Fiorina chose not to focus on    but    an issue irrelevant to her suitability for the presidency.  Finally, her particular critique suggests that Clinton’s marriage is a sham tool in her unseemly  —   unwomanly?  —   quest for power. Clinton is, in Fiorina’s depiction, a grasping woman willing to tolerate humiliation in the service of her ambition.  Would Fiorina question the amount of time that a male candidate spends with his wife and family? Of course not. Indeed, unedited video footage posted by Sen. Ted Cruz’s ( .) campaign includes his wife describing how he once returned home to Texas to his daughter shrieking, “There’s a guest in the house!”  Heidi Cruz: “So even though they know he’s very much a part of our home, they do sometimes see him as a guest. ”  To imagine how that would play with a female candidate in the   parent role is to recognize the double standard to which female candidates are subjected  —   including by rivals of their own gender.

209326,Bernie Sanders gains on Hillary Clinton in a new poll – but it’s not all good news for him,Washington Post,Philip Bump,M,2016-01-19,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160120025445/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/19/bernie-sanders-gains-on-hillary-clinton-in-a-new-poll-but-its-not-all-good-news-for-him/
","       When Monmouth University surveyed Democrats nationally last month, the picture was a familiar one. Hillary Clinton led Bernie Sanders by 33 points, 59 percent to Sanders’s 26. That was   before more recent national polls putting Sanders and Clinton a bit closer  —   like one just out from Monmouth. This new survey has Clinton with a   lead, a swing of 18 points toward Sanders. Support for Clinton has fallen to 52 percent nationally, while support for Sanders has increased to 37. Clinton down 7; Sanders up 11. That’s a very big swing over the course of a month, one that could suggest that either December’s poll or this one is an outlier  —   or that we’re starting to see the sort of   movement that is not uncommon in a primary season. It’s worth looking at how support among demographic groups shifted over that time period. We’ve broken out Monmouth’s numbers below. Clinton’s lead among liberals, moderates, men, women, younger people, older people and whites fell since last month  —   evaporating entirely among liberals, younger people and whites.     Only among black and Latino Democratic voters did Clinton’s lead grow, from a healthy 43 points to a massive 50 points. We’ve talked about this a lot recently. It’s a critical split in the Democratic base, one which explains why Sanders and Clinton are running close in Iowa and New Hampshire  —   two very white states  —   and why Clinton is up by a wide margin in South Carolina (less white). If Clinton and Sanders are tied among white voters as the primaries progress, her support from   voters can make a difference in states where whites aren’t an overwhelming majority. Sanders has room to grow. Clinton is seen more favorably in the new Monmouth poll, but only because   of respondents still don’t know enough about Sanders to have an opinion.   percent of the people Monmouth talked to had no opinion of Sanders to 9 percent for Clinton  —   suggesting that a decent part of the population, including many   voters, don’t know much about the Vermont senator at all. That said, there’s an important bit of good news for Clinton worth mentioning. While many Democrats think Clinton and Sanders would be equally likely to defeat top Republican contenders, far more people say that only about Clinton. As Democratic voters make up their minds, the ability to defeat Republicans in November will be a critical consideration, and here Clinton has an advantage.     The Iowa caucuses are in 12 days, and Clinton holds a narrow lead in the polling average. If national polling shifted this much over the last month, though, it’s safe to assume that the races in Iowa and New Hampshire are subject to some similarly dramatic shifts as the hours tick by. Those states won’t test the racial split in the party, though  —   and if nothing changes on that front, Sanders still faces a significant hurdle.    Bernie Sanders enjoys strong support among young voters, but they’ll need to turn out at the polls if he wants to win the Democratic nomination. (Peter   Washington Post)   "
209400,"Top Democrats, and a little bit of Hollywood, are rushing to Iowa to boost Hillary Clinton",Washington Post,Philip Rucker,M,2016-01-22,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160123003737/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-democrats-and-a-little-bit-of-hollywood-are-rushing-to-iowa-to-save-hillary-clinton/2016/01/22/29c4970a-c113-11e5-9443-7074c3645405_story.html
","  DES MOINES  —   With another Iowa presidential contest at risk of slipping out of Hillary Clinton’s reach, the Democratic Party is launching a massive effort this weekend to boost her candidacy. A crowd of   entertainment and political figures, including Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (Va.) a former party chairman, and Tony Goldwyn, star of the hit series “Scandal,” is jetting to all corners of this state to help Clinton erase her enthusiasm deficit to Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt. ). And major progressive groups such as the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the National Education Association are firing up their political operations, including   teams and phone banks, to give her an outside push. The campaign and its allies had planned all along to escalate their efforts at this point, as the caucuses near. However, Democratic governors, senators and other party leaders said they are increasingly alarmed at the prospect of Sanders, a   democratic socialist, surfing a wave of populist frustration to the nomination. And they were quick in interviews this week to dispense advice to Clinton. Get feisty and real, they said. Open your heart. Find visceral ways to show people how you would fix their problems. Most of all, throw that Clintonian caution to the wind and sharpen your attacks on the senator from Vermont: Challenge his knowledge of foreign affairs, his     plan, his temperament and his ability to forge consensus in Washington.     These Democrats said Clinton should call for more debates so she can prosecute the case against Sanders. They said it is imperative for her husband, former president Bill Clinton, to assume an even greater role in crystallizing the choice for Democrats. “It’s important that she draw more contrasts with Sanders without ticking off his supporters,” said former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, a Clinton endorser. “Do it carefully, do it succinctly, but you have to do it because this is when voters are picking candidates. You can’t run a   campaign now. ”  [Sanders camp calls Clinton ally David Brock a ‘mudslinger’]  In the 2008 campaign, Clinton was at her best when she was losing to Barack Obama. As she is under siege anew this year, her allies said they hope to see her return to that performance level. “She’s no stranger to this,” said Kaine, a top Obama backer eight years ago who now supports Clinton. “In ’08, she was always stronger when pressed  —   after Iowa, then in New Hampshire; after Super Tuesday, then in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. She was always, always better when the going got tough. ” Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.) another Clinton convert from the Obama team, said: “She does her best work as an underdog. She’s got amazing determination and grit. ” In the final week before the caucuses, Clinton is relying heavily on the formidable ground organization her campaign began building last spring. She has invested heavily in Iowa, viewing the caucuses, where she finished a devastating third in 2008, as the top priority this time around. Her campaign long ago recruited volunteers in all of the state’s 1, 680 precincts and for months has been surgically targeting likely  .   A volunteer at Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ Jan. 19 event in Fort Dodge, Iowa, wears a shirt decorated with Sanders’ image. (Jim  )  Long considered Clinton’s to lose, the Iowa race is now a dead heat, with some recent public polls showing Sanders inching ahead. Sanders has scaled up his ground organization and is spending heavily on television advertising. This week, he boarded a hulking new bus and barnstormed the state, staging the large rallies that have become his signature as well as more intimate events in rural areas. “You tell me: Which campaign, objectively speaking, is creating the energy and the enthusiasm for a large voter turnout?” Sanders asked reporters Tuesday. “Everybody knows that it is our campaign. ” From Day One, the mantra from Clinton’s New York headquarters has been to prepare for a competitive primary, starting in Iowa. As Delaware Gov. Jack Markell said, “I don’t really remember a Democratic primary that was not competitive. ” Publicly at least, Clinton’s senior advisers project calm and composure. In the tightening polls, they see a silver lining: Her supporters have been shaken awake, erasing fears of complacency. On the ground here, there has been a noticeable difference between Clinton’s events and Sanders’s, where a seemingly more organic enthusiasm is on display. To close that gap, Clinton is deploying star power. Thursday night, she rallied with pop singer Demi Lovato at the University of Iowa’s student union, a hive of Sanders fans. This weekend, actors Goldwyn and Jamie Lee Curtis; Sens. Kaine, Cory Booker (N. J.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N. Y.); and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro are fanning out across Iowa for their own organizing events. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said he regrets that there are not more days on the calendar for the Clintons to campaign in Iowa. “Honestly, I just wish we had more time to get her and President Clinton out to talk to people,” he said, noting that about half the attendees at these events sign “commit to caucus” cards pledging their support. Outside groups backing Clinton are helping with phone banks and   outreach, and by showing up at her events. At a rally in Vinton, members of the NEA, the nation’s largest teachers union, came out in force wearing   pins and stickers, and waving signs. The union’s state chapter, the Iowa State Education Association, which has 35, 000 members, also worked with the campaign to identify some precinct captains. “We want to win,” chapter President Tammy Wawro said. “This is the bottom line, and we need to come out of the gate with a candidate that can win. ” After the Human Rights Campaign endorsed Clinton this week, the gay rights group’s staffers in Iowa have been urging members to caucus for her. President Chad Griffin will officially endorse Clinton on Sunday in Des Moines. Also providing a lift is Emily’s List, which recruits and supports female candidates and was an early Clinton ally. President Stephanie Schriock spent Thursday and Friday rallying Clinton volunteers and organizers at eight stops in Iowa. “This is actually what we do as progressives,” Schriock said. After giving Clinton its   primary endorsement, Planned Parenthood adopted a “whatever it takes” strategy to support her in Iowa. The group sent mailers, organized phone banks and plans to soon release digital ads on Clinton’s behalf. President Cecile Richards is holding her own events here Saturday and Sunday. Another abortion rights group,   Choice America, has invested in the range of six figures in an effort to boost Clinton in Iowa. With a staff of 10, NARAL is focusing on canvassing in Ames, Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, as well as manning phone banks to reach members in other parts of the state. Democratic leaders are resigned to the reality that Clinton is in danger of losing both the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses and, eight days later, the New Hampshire primary, where Sanders has long had a leg up. “I realize that at this moment in the primary cycle, in both parties, being pragmatic, experienced and visionary isn’t in vogue,” said Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Clinton supporter. But eventually, Shumlin said, “voters are going to want to choose someone who is a bright, experienced, capable, pragmatic progressive who has a track record of pulling people together to get really tough things done. That’s Hillary. ”  [Sanders camp airs closing campaign ad in Iowa filled with inspired voters ]  Clinton allies find comfort in the calendar. Iowa and New Hampshire are overwhelmingly white states with decidedly liberal Democratic electorates. But next up are contests in Nevada and South Carolina, states that have more diverse and centrist voters, which could play to Clinton’s strengths. Many of the March events are in states across the South and the Midwest, where Clinton is favored. Within the Democratic elite, where Clinton enjoys   support, the antipathy toward Sanders has grown steadily as he has emerged as a potential Clinton slayer. All week, McCaskill has been loudly predicting an electoral catastrophe if her party nominates Sanders. “Bernie has labeled himself a socialist  —   we’re not labeling Bernie as a socialist  —   and I know what the Republicans will do with that,” McCaskill said Thursday. “They’re going to rip him from limb to limb! . . . I said, ‘They’re going to connect him to communism,’ and [GOP   Donald] Trump did it yesterday. ” Delaware’s Markell, also a Clinton backer, agreed. “If I were a candidate for the Senate or governor or Congress in Ohio or Florida or Missouri or New Hampshire or Pennsylvania, I’d be really, really concerned,” he said. Clinton’s supporters said she could dispatch Sanders if she adjusted her message. One fix Richardson suggested: “Use Bill Clinton more than they’re doing. He’s an asset. I know there’s all this [Monica] Lewinsky stuff, but people remember the good economy of Clinton. ” Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio) said one of Hillary Clinton’s finest moments of late was when she spoke forcefully in last weekend’s debate about the water crisis in Flint, Mich. “Her rhetoric is not as strong as Bernie’s, but that does not fix these problems,” said Brown, a Clinton supporter. “She can reach people equally by telling their stories and talking about how she’s going to fix them. I’m convinced she can. She’s not doing it as well as we’d like yet, but she will. ”  John Wagner in Iowa and Mike DeBonis, Karoun Demirjian, Anne Gearan and Kelsey Snell in Washington contributed to this report. "

"," For Hillary Clinton, it’s starting to look like deja vu all over again. Start a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination as giant  . Check. Raise tens of millions of dollars and look unbeatable for large swaths of the year before the primaries start. Check. An insurgent challenger running to her ideological left? Check. Collapsing poll numbers on the eve of actual votes? Check. Over the past week or so, Clinton has watched as her national polling lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) a   socialist, has shrunk. And, far more important, Clinton’s standing    Sanders in the key   states of Iowa and New Hampshire has eroded as well.  In Iowa, after holding a    lead (at worst) for months, Clinton now finds herself in a dead heat with the caucuses just over a week away. The Real Clear Politics polling average gives Clinton an edge of less than five points.  Sanders has always run stronger in New Hampshire than in Iowa, but of late several polls suggest that he is widening his steady lead over the former secretary of state. In the Real Clear Politics polling average, Sanders is up by almost 13 points.       [Sanders goes for “hope and change” in new ad]  Lose both of those states early next month, and Clinton’s inevitability bubble bursts. Period.  Clinton, to her credit, is doing everything she can to avoid a repeat of 2008. She’s savaging Sanders as both too conservative (on guns) and too     liberal (on health care).  Complicating those efforts is the news that broke midweek: The intelligence community’s inspector general confirmed that dozens of emails on the private server Clinton used while she was at the State Department contained extremely highly classified information. Clinton continues to stick by her original line on the email controversy  —   that she never sent or received anything that was classified at the time  —   but the latest news is proof that the story and its reverberations are likely to dog her all the way through the campaign.

","I was pretty sure I knew who to vote for earlier this month, until Jeffrey Cohen died. See, when Ernest Overbey died on Jan. 2, his obituary in the Richmond   instructed readers to ”please vote for Donald Trump” (as well as to donate to the hospital that cared for him). I’m certainly not going to reject a dying man’s wish, so that was that. Then Mr. Cohen died in Pittsburgh. And his obituary in the   asked people, ”Please do not vote for Donald Trump.” (Or to donate to an educational foundation.) So what is a conscientious person supposed to do with that?      If there’s one thing that I know, it’s that I’m not meant to vote for Hillary Clinton. Stephen Ryan of New York (”In lieu of flowers, please don’t vote for Hillary”) Arnold Mininger of California (”In lieu of flowers, please don’t vote for for Hillary”) Michael Klein of Michigan (”Opinionated (please don’t vote for Hillary!) outspoken, sometimes even a little bit grumpy”) Elaine Fydrych of New Jersey (”In lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Hillary Clinton. ”) Eddylou Brown (”In lieu of flowers, please don’t vote for Hillary”) and Karl Kmentt of Ohio (”His only regret is NOT being able to vote against Hillary Clinton in the next presidential election”) made that perfectly clear. Sorry, Harold Cecil of Florida! Your final ”special request” to ”please vote for Hillary in 2016” was outnumbered. This is, after all, a democracy. This trend of telling the world how to vote after you are dead appears to be fairly recent in provenance, but maybe it’s just that the internet allows all of us to pass these things around more easily. In the year 2000, there were a few news stories about guys (it’s usually guys) asking people to vote for George W. Bush (it’s usually  ). James Hollister and James Fete both worked Dubya into their obituaries; Hollister included a plug for Cheney. In 2004, Stephen Shepard’s children celebrated his memory by running an item in the Hartford Courant posthumously guilting voters on Stephen’s behalf. ”We hope that in your memory,” it read, ”all your friends and admirers will vote against Bush.” Maybe they did, but it didn’t really matter in Connecticut anyway. The first time Clinton ran for president, Sara Buckner of Florida took space in her 2009 obituary to point out that she wanted to vote against Hillary the year prior, but Barack Obama deprived her of that opportunity.    (Giphy)  Speaking of Obama! If you were planning your 2012 vote based on a tally of the mentions in obituaries, you would have wanted to vote for Mitt Romney. Vernon Boddicker of Arizona and Audrey Barker of Texas tried to plan their    around the 2012 election. Boddicker wasn’t successful (”His only regret was that he would not be able to vote against Obama. ”). Barker was (”She loved Mark Levine and vowed to stay alive long enough to vote against President Obama. ”) Pearl Levine of New Jersey offered Obama her dying support, and was no doubt smiling when Karl Rove was breathlessly insisting that Ohio was still close on election night. It’s rare that someone would go out of their way to undercut a   candidate with their final words, but there’s a noteworthy example that we’d like to share. The Las Vegas   published the obituary of Charlotte McCourt of Pahrump, who died in July 2010. McCourt ”assisted in many political figures’ campaign efforts,” the obituary read. One of those efforts was singled out by McCourt’s children, just as the subject was set to seek reelection. ”We believe that Mom would say she was mortified to have taken a large role in the election of Harry Reid to U. S. Congress,” the obituary said. ”Let the record show Charlotte was displeased with his work. Please, in lieu of flowers, vote for another more worthy candidate.” Harry Reid won reelection, of course. In death, as in life, one vote rarely makes a difference."
209549,The State Department: Hillary Clinton’s email correspondence contained ‘top secret’ material,Washington Post,Rosalind S. Helderman,M,2016-01-29,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160130020655/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/29/the-state-department-concludes-there-is-top-secret-material-in-hillary-clintons-email-correspondence-from-her-time-as-secretary-of-state/
","       The State Department has concluded there is ”top secret” material in Hillary Clinton’s email correspondence from the time she was secretary of state, indicating that some of her emails will never be released, even in heavily redacted form, because they are too sensitive for the public to view. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the material crosses seven email chains, amounting to 37 pages worth of material. The finding is likely to deepen the political consequences for Clinton of her decision to use a private email account, routed through a server installed in her suburban New York home, and it comes just three days before the Iowa caucuses, as Clinton remains locked in a heated battle with Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) for the Democratic presidential nomination. The State Department’s conclusion came as it has worked to process 55, 000 pages of Clinton’s correspondence for public release, including about 1, 000 pages that will be released Friday evening. Clinton has said none of her emails were marked classified when they were sent. However, it is the responsibility of individual government officials to handle classified material appropriately, including by properly marking it as classified, and the finding means that information deemed highly sensitive passed through the unsecured system that Clinton directed be established for her use. Kirby said the State Department has not yet made a determination of whether the information was classified at the time it was sent or has become more sensitive due to subsequent events. He said that, regardless, the information was deemed too sensitive Friday for release. Kirby also said for the first time that some emails between Clinton and President Obama have been located and will also be withheld from public release. He said there were 18 emails between the two, comprising eight email chains. None will be released publicly. The State Department has already released about 1, 300 emails that contained classified material, but the vast majority were labeled by State Department reviewers as ”confidential,” the least sensitive category of classification. The inspector general of the intelligence community has indicated that he believes some of the emails contain ”top secret” material, the highest level of classification. But the State Department had declined to concur with the assessment, allowing Clinton and her supporters to ascribe some concerns about the presence of government secrets in her emails to disputes between agencies. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon called the decision ”  run amok” and called for the emails to be released publicly despite the State Department’s finding. ”After a process that has been dominated by bureaucratic infighting that has too often played out in public view, the loudest and leakiest participants in this interagency dispute have now prevailed in blocking any release of these emails. This flies in the face of the fact that these emails were unmarked at the time they were sent, and have been called ’innocuous’ by certain intelligence officials,” he said in a statement. He indicated that the emails in question were exchanged between State Department officials using their official accounts before they were shared with Clinton on her private server. They have remained on the department’s unclassified system for years. And, in at least one case, the emails appear to involve information from a published news article,” he said. Kirby indicated that the classification decision was made by the State Department but said officials there made the determination at the request of the intelligence community. An FBI probe of the security of Clinton’s email setup continues, with Republicans increasingly insisting that the Justice Department take legal action against Clinton for mishandling classified information. The State Department has been under a court order to release the documents in batches, once a month, as part of a lawsuit filed by reporter Jason Leopold of Vice News, who sued after the department failed to promptly respond to his request for the public documents. The department has so far released approximately 42, 000 pages of Clinton’s correspondence. While a judge had ordered the department to release all of the emails by the end of January, lawyers for the department said this week that they would miss the deadline and requested another month. That would mean the last of the emails would not be released until the end of February    after the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, officials there told a federal judge this week. The lawyers said there are 9, 000 more pages left to review and release. But they indicated that 7, 000 of those pages required review by other government departments before they could be made public, so as to allow other agencies the opportunity to flag material they considered classified. The lawyers indicated that the department discovered several weeks ago that the documents still needed review and had not yet been distributed, a process that was further slowed by the weekend blizzard, which shut down government for days. Clinton has encouraged the State Department to release her emails as quickly as possible and, when delays have occurred, her campaign has been quick to point out that they do not control the schedule, which was set by the court and government bureaucrats. ”I think it’s great. Let people sort them through,” Clinton said at a town hall sponsored by CNN in Iowa earlier this week. ”And as we have seen there is a lot . .. [of] interest. But it’s something that took time to get done.” In December 2014, Clinton submitted 30, 000 emails to the State Department from her private account  —   adding up to 55, 000 pages of correspondence the department has been slowly making public.    CNN host Chris Cuomo questioned Hillary Clinton on the email server she used during her time as Secretary of State during the Jan. 25 town hall in Des Moines, Iowa. (CNN)    "

"," A  steady drip of comments just before the Iowa caucuses has left little doubt: Many former Obama aides consider Hillary Clinton his natural heir. One former staffer put it pretty directly, saying that Bernie Sanders’s campaign “resembles Howard Dean’s a lot more than it resembles Barack Obama’s. ”  It was a clear shorthand for “insurgent who lost”  —   fair enough. Obama’s the insurgent who won, right?  But that isn’t really the whole story. The Obama organization’s strength eight years ago came from its unlikely and somehow functional mix of insurgents and insiders. This time, the two leading Democrats are each succeeding in only half of that equation  —   and that’s a problem they will both need to solve to have the best chance at winning a general election.  (Two disclaimers at this point. One: I ran Obama’s digital efforts in 2008 and 2012, but I don’t personally have a candidate in this race. Two: The company I lead, Blue State Digital, has done work for all three Democratic presidential campaigns and the Democratic National Committee this cycle.) Obama’s 2008 campaign achieved an incredibly difficult balance, making an orderly organization out of the pragmatic and the   alike. Many senior staffers were operatives who’d worked in Congress or for previous Democratic presidential bids, but a huge portion of the wider team, especially in the field and digital operations, had little previous campaign experience, if they had any. Obama himself reflected these two sides: The measured constitutional law professor was also the community organizer who’d opposed “ a dumb war ” in Iraq.  That a   movement propelled Obama in 2008 is  : A huge share of our volunteers and   donors were engaging with the political process deeply for the very first time. But that campaign redefined modern election tactics not only by raising a massive   insurgency but by playing the inside game well.  The insiders were crucial in building the case for Obama with outreach to elected officials, big donors and superdelegate types who could help him secure the Democratic nomination and the influence of the mainstream media. The finance team matched Clinton and outpaced John McCain in 2008, and then Mitt Romney in 2012, dollar for dollar in large contributions. Those insiders built a kind of scaffolding, and the insurgent grass roots stretched to bring in more   donations than any other campaign in history and did the hard work at the doors, on the phones and in the community that provided our margin of victory. That inside game is the sort of campaign that Clinton has excelled at, especially in this cycle, and it’s been one of Sanders’s biggest weaknesses up to now. But one of the underappreciated consequences of those Obama campaigns, which we’re seeing play out in this primary and will be felt for years to come, has been the modernization of mass mobilization in the Democratic Party. Thousands of staffers and volunteers got the training and seasoning that come with being part of a big, broad   effort.  This means there’s a new default level of sophistication for a Democratic presidential campaign. Both the Clinton and Sanders teams inherited an ingrained culture of constant testing and   optimization that shapes every ad, every email, every call script for a volunteer and every list of voters they call. And both campaigns have built their organizing efforts on the foundation of tech and data infrastructure at the Democratic National Committee that first came together in the 2008 cycle. This modernization of   also means that the potency of an   campaign has grown  —   by a lot. In a previous era, a candidate like Sanders might have been deprived of the scarce talent or limited party infrastructure needed to mount an   campaign. But Sanders has been able to make use of the wide talent pool and the specific tech cultivated by Obama, and he’s now surpassed the pace of   fundraising that the Obama campaign set in 2008 and 2012, with more than 2. 5 million individual contributions before the Iowa caucuses. (Obama, by the end of 2011, had 2. 2 million.) That’s not because he’s a more compelling candidate than Obama or because he’s got a better shot of winning than Obama did at this point in the 2008 race. But the people doing the organizing and   fundraising, and the technology platforms they use, trace their roots to the insurgent branch of the Obama campaign  —   and in some cases even to Dean’s campaign and his tenure as chairman at the DNC. Perhaps even more important than skills and software, the insurgents have been emboldened with the audacity to think they can win. And it’s clear that, whether you support him or not, Sanders’s campaign is the home of the prevailing   energy in this race. The most recent financial reports, for the period that ended in October, showed that the amount Clinton raised from donors giving less than $200 decreased from $8 million to $5. 2 million, while Sanders’s   take nearly doubled, from $10. 4 million to $20. 2 million. Clinton raised barely a quarter of the amount from   donors that Sanders did. Whatever the ultimate result, that shows the Sanders campaign has accomplished extraordinary things in volunteer mobilization and   fundraising, period. Those accomplishments are all the more remarkable for just how isolated from elites Sanders’s campaign is. One tally of endorsements by various elected officials puts Clinton ahead of Sanders 458 to 2. Even more than Dean in 2004, Sanders is running a true outsider bid. Yes, there was an outpouring of   support for Dean (I worked on that campaign, too) but he also had an inside game that people tend to forget. Heading into Iowa, he had endorsements from Al Gore, former Texas governor Ann Richards, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, and big unions such as the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The campaign just blew it, failing to turn either all that insider cred or its insurgent energy into a functioning organization.  Obama proved there’s no reason to conflate “insurgent” with “disorganized. ” But Clinton is actually playing the inside game now better than she did eight years ago: Her total dominance among party leadership far exceeds her 2008 position or even Gore’s over Bill Bradley in 2000. Whether you support her or not, she and her team set out to build  —   and have built  —   the kind of base that, if not for the new durability of an insurgency like Sanders’s, would have cleared the field and made for a formidable, unified front in November. A successful   campaign requires that kind of skill and political organization. Without it, even the   insurgent campaign won’t be sufficient to marshal a major political party to victory.  No matter who wins, though, this primary season has shown  —   even before the voting begins  —   that our eventual nominee will need to figure out how their organization can replicate what the other candidate has done so well. If Clinton prevails, she’ll need to find a way to build the   side of her campaign and encourage the many people who are legitimately excited about her candidacy to be more actively engaged in it. If Sanders wins, he’ll need to pay far more attention to traditional politics than he’s done so far, in order to leverage the institutional support that the Democratic Party apparatus can provide its nominee. The winner will be tempted to view victory as a validation of the   or   approach. But they will need to grapple with the reality that the opponent they’ve just defeated will, nevertheless, have accomplished something they didn’t.

209625,Why it matters so much if Hillary Clinton loses Iowa tonight,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-02-01,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160202001708/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/01/what-it-means-if-hillary-clinton-loses-iowa-tonight/
","     It’s hard to exaggerate how much is on the line for Hillary Clinton when Iowans head to their caucuses on Monday night. If Clinton wins, her path to the nomination grows smoother. Even allowing that Sen. Bernie Sanders would likely win New Hampshire’s primary in eight days, Clinton would remain   to beat Sanders in Nevada, South Carolina and into the decisive month of March when a bulk of Democratic delegates are allocated. Lose on Monday, however, and the best case scenario for Clinton becomes a protracted    delegate battle with Sanders that could extend well beyond March. And that’s the best case scenario. Consider this: If Clinton comes up short against Sanders tonight, she will almost certainly lose New Hampshire to Sanders on Feb. 9. Sanders’s average lead over Clinton in polling conducted in the Granite State over the last two weeks is 18 points, according to Real Clear Politics. It’s hard to imagine that lead shrinking in the event that Sanders wins Iowa tonight. Take a step back and think about what that would mean. The former first lady, former secretary of state and former senator from New York    with all of the establishment backing in the party and a massive lead over all comers when she entered the race    would have lost to a septuagenerian democratic socialist from Vermont.   [Iowa caucuses: Here’s how the voting works]   Which brings me to this point: This is not 2008    for lots of reasons. For one, Clinton never had a lead in national polling (or in Iowa) anywhere close to the one she enjoyed in the early stages of the 2016 campaign. And, she faced a far more crowded field. More importantly, Sanders is not Obama. Obama, from the time he delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, was pegged for great things. While people didn’t necessarily expect him to beat Clinton for the nomination, there was a sense that he was a     political talent who might rewrite all of the old rules. Sanders is not those things. He is someone who has spent 25 years in Congress    largely on the outskirts due to his socialist ideology and his deeply liberal ideas. He is someone who announced his presidential bid on the lawn outside of the Senate    with a few dozen reporters in attendance. He is someone, in short, that no one    including Bernie Sanders    thought would make even a   run at Clinton’s dominance. Sanders’s rise, then, is rightly understood as only partially about him at all. What Sanders has done is merely provide a vessel into which a   number of Democratic voters can pour their doubts about Clinton’s commitment to true liberal principles    or really any set of deeply held values. Sanders’s rise is entirely predicated on being the  ; he is the        combing vision that many people have for what a politician should be    a ”Mr. Smith goes to Washington” if Mr. Smith looked sort of like Larry David and talked like Woody Allen. To lose to that sort of candidate would be a major psychological blow to Clinton    and the entire establishment that has lined up behind her. (Sanders has not been endorsed by a single U. S. senator.) And it would quickly set off a panic within that same establishment about the prospect of what a Sanders’s nomination could mean for downballot Democrats    given his unwavering advocacy for tax increases to pay for his health care plan. Such a panic could    could not would    make it difficult for Clinton to last until primary votes that are more friendly for her like in South Carolina on Feb. 27. Talk of trying to add another establishment candidate to the mix    Joe Biden, anyone?    would immediately begin. Clinton could, of course, weather those worries and score a series of victories in South Carolina and beyond. But, as I mentioned above, that sort of   fight would be Clinton’s best case scenario if she loses Iowa tonight. The stakes are, therefore, unimaginably high for her. Her future political career could well hang in the balance."

","       It is the nature of our political environment that the best performance of one’s career can be ignored  —   and ruined  —   because of a single remark. Hillary Clinton was sailing along in the Democratic town hall hosted by CNN Wednesday night, sounding thoughtful and at ease when  —   bam!  —   the viral disaster ensued: ANDERSON COOPER: One of the things that Sen. [Bernie] Sanders points to and a lot of your critics point to is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs. You were paid $675, 000 for three speeches. Was that a mistake? I mean was that a bad error in judgment? CLINTON: Look. I made speeches to lots of groups. I told them what I thought. I answered questions. COOPER: But did you have to be paid $675, 000? CLINTON: Well, I don’t know. That’s what they offered. And if her feigned obliviousness to the   game were not infuriating enough, she let out yet another whopper: CLINTON : You know every secretary of State that I know has done [paid speeches]. COOPER: But (inaudible) for office they’re not running for an office  …     CLINTON: Well, I didn’t know  …     COOPER:   …     have known. CLINTON: To be honest I wasn’t  —   I wasn’t committed to running. I didn’t know whether I would or not. COOPER: You didn’t think you were going to run for president again? CLINTON: I didn’t. You know when I was secretary of State several times I said you know I think I’m done. And you know, so many people came to me, started talking to me. Really? Even while secretary of state, as we know from her emails, her political antennae were on high alert. And certainly those who paid her exorbitant sums and donated to her foundation believed that she would run for president. That is what drove up her price. The good Hillary Clinton  —   knowledgeable, occasionally thoughtful (as when expounding on the centrality of gratitude in her life)  —   is inseparable from the bad Hillary Clinton  —   often dull and entirely incapable of hiding her greed. When she is hitting her stride, one can imagine how impressive she might be in a general election, but then fairly or not, she can be so unforgettably awful that her strengths are ignored. It is not surprising that Republicans pounced as soon as the words “That’s what they offered” escaped her lips. “With her incredibly tone deaf answer on her exorbitant speaking fees, Hillary ‘Dead Broke’ Clinton gave New Hampshire voters a good reason not to support her next Tuesday,” Jeff Bechdel of America Rising said in a prepared statement. “The Clintons have lived at the nexus of money and politics for the last quarter century, and it’s one of the main reasons she is struggling so mightily in the areas of trust, ethics, and honesty. ” Clinton likes to fancy herself as an innocent (Oh, gosh, they just wanted to pay me a lot because what I say is so interesting) or a victim. She insisted that the vast   conspiracy is still going strong: “Yes. It has gotten even better funded. You know, they brought in some new   to pump the money in. And, look, these guys play for keeps. They want to control our country. . . . They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to. ” Well, that’s an apt description of her Wall Street backers as well. Clinton sees herself as the    . She is entitled to bend or disregard the rules because her motives are so pure, you see. We cannot question her motives or her shortcuts since she is, in her own mind, above reproach. Those motives always entail her acquisition of great power and wealth. Coincidence? Hardly."

","     In the annals of history, nothing said this weekend about the duties, obligations or habits of young women and politics will rank among the most egregious public comments made about women during the 2016 race. But they do merit mention. Just in case you missed these     weekend moments, what we are referring to here is the decision of feminist activist and cultural icon Gloria Steinem and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright  —   a woman regarded as the embodiment of female ability,   and grit  —   to essentially reprimand and ridicule women who do not plan to vote for Hillary Clinton.   [Clinton looks to sisterhood, but votes may go to Sanders]      Madeleine Albright, the first ever female Secretary of State, told supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that ”there’s a special place in hell” for women who don’t help each other. (Reuters)   Their logic differs slightly and yet seems to grow from the same diseased tree. But take just a few steps back here, and there is almost no one involved in this story  —   not those who made the comments, not those who have expressed outrage, not those who insist that their Democratic presidential candidate is better for women than the other  —   who really has much room to brag, boast or lambaste. Steinem essentially told HBO host Bill Maher that young women are throwing their support behind Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) because this is where politically active, progressive young men can be found in a social   cluster. Steinem’s comments were, to say the least, just a bit dismissive about the sound political reasons that some young women  —   and to be clear, the numbers indicate that we are talking about young, white women here  —   prefer Sanders over Clinton.  There is also little evidence that this strategy has been employed   works. Frankly, if winning young women’s votes was really as simple as finding an attractive group of young men to staff a campaign, it’s pretty clear that just about every campaign would do just that. What we do have, though, is evidence that married women  —   particularly women who do not work outside the home  —   are more likely to vote in ways that mirror their husbands. There are lots of data to show married women  —   particularly    moms  —   vote more conservatively than single women. And this offers a pretty strong counter to Steinem’s attempted young woman dis. Married women, who are also more likely to be white women and, in this country, in their   or or older, are not exactly a reliable part of the Democratic coalition at all. In 2012, a majority of white women and white married women, in particular, voted for Romney. Now, back to this weekend’s list of interesting ideas expressed about young women. At a Clinton campaign event in New Hampshire, Albright was actually repeating something she has said so often that it once appeared as a   statement on Starbucks coffee cups. Albright said there was a ”special place in Hell” for women who do not support other women or, worse, stand in their way or feel some duty to make other women’s lives hard to test and season them. That’s a set of ideas that may be almost always applicable in the office, or worth considering in the conduct of other portions of one’s life. But when it comes to politics, Albright and anyone else who agrees with this idea may need to remember that young female voters are like all others: Their votes must be earned. And that’s done by understanding their political needs, embedding policy proposals and ideas that address and prioritize those concerns at the center of a candidate’s platform, and being mindful of not just what is said in the course of a campaign, but how it is said. One needs to actually listen to the groups of voters with which a candidate is doing well and those with which a candidate is not. And a campaign that wants to move people out of the latter group and into the former can’t be dismissive about what those people who aren’t backing their candidate have to say. All of that is so very basic to the idea of campaigning and democracy that it’s actually rather sad that it must be said. But it boils down to this: Votes have to be earned. And any sort of entitled claim that certain votes belong to certain candidates is inherently disrespectful and opens the people and campaigns that lean upon them to reasonable ridicule. It’s also a tactic that Clinton and her supporters already tried in 2008 when Clinton was trying to defeat Barack Obama. It did not work well then, either. This lesson really ought to have been learned.    Former U. S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright, left, introduces Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during a campaign stop at Rundlett Middle School in Concord, N. H. on Feb. 6. (Adrees  )  That, of course, is exactly what Sanders’s   supporters have said everywhere and anywhere they could in the hours since Steinem and Albright said what they did. Several have been so bold as to profess to having a   view of women and their political views and obligations. And that, quite frankly, is also laughable. The weekend collection of comments about young women and what they ”ought to do” in relationship to Hillary Clinton is, no doubt, insulting. Still, no one who has had any kind of contact with more than 10 Sanders supporters will deny this. The Sanders camp  —   be it the campaign or the campaign’s rabid and vocal supporters  —   is not likely to be described as particularly respectful of those who do not agree with them completely. (Witness the ”Berniebros. ”) As an at least partial result of this, the Sanders campaign has a notable demographic problem with voters of color  —   including young women of color  —   to which their most frequent responses seem to center around the idea that these people ”ought” to support Sanders and need to educate themselves. The Sanders campaign and many of its most rabid supporters seem quite dismissive of the idea that the campaign may need to actually do or say anything different to win those votes.   [Bernie Sanders’s real problem with black and Hispanic voters]   Sanders’s pitch to women is largely about young white women whose primary political concerns may include things such as college debt load and costs. These are legitimate issues that the Sanders campaign has long put    in its platform and campaign appeals. But Clinton has put different issues or different frames on issues that have helped her do well with women of color  —   across the age spectrum. An example: Clinton has talked about the essential role that raising the minimum wage could play in lifting more women of color and children living in single parent homes out of poverty. So you see, if Sanders fans want to argue that the Clinton campaign should be respectful of the legitimate political concerns of young (white) women, that’s fine. But they also have to accept that same truth about the concerns of young and older women of color. Then there is this: One of the many reasons (and there are several) that the feminist movement has long struggled in its effort to speak for and to women  —   to become a kind of powerful and sustained organizing force in the political activity and lives of women  —   is the failure to first acknowledge and then address the very different social and economic positions of white and   women. These differences begin to explain why white women have, in more than a few recent presidential general elections, actually backed Republicans rather than any Democrat. Take a moment to look closely at the chart below, pulled from a 2015 report compiled by the Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics and the Higher Heights Foundation. Note the fact that a majority of white women  —   and white women alone  —   have backed the Republican presidential candidate each election since 2000.     And that’s a reality that really ought to humble every single person, campaign and campaign supporter mentioned above."
209808,Hillary Clinton just lost women to Bernie Sanders. But don’t blame Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem.,Washington Post,Janell Ross,F,2016-02-10,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160211003009/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/10/hillary-clinton-just-lost-women-to-bernie-sanders-but-dont-blame-madeleine-albright-and-gloria-steinem/
","       Perhaps the Clinton campaign’s internal polling had, by this weekend, made it clear just how poorly Hillary Clinton was doing among New Hampshire women. Maybe that triggered some kind of distress signal broadcast to Clinton’s   female supporters and surrogates. Maybe that helped set in motion the entire Madeleine     Clinton fiasco this week. But now, with the New Hampshire primary done, Clinton’s rather dire situation with women  —   particularly young white women in that state  —   is pretty clear for all to see. Clinton did not simply lose New Hampshire on Tuesday night to Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) by around 20 points; she also narrowly lost New Hampshire women to Sanders, too. In fact, early exit polling indicated that Clinton lost the quest for female voters to Sanders. Late Tuesday night, Sanders led her among women by around 10 points, according to exit polls reported by CNN. That’s right. The group that the Clinton campaign and  —   if we are honest  —   many a political prognosticator long assumed would form a strong contingent of Clinton’s voters due, at least in some part, to the thrilling prospect of casting votes that might help to put the first woman in the White House, appears to have opted for Sanders instead. In Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton did manage to pull off a narrow, if contested, overall victory and won Iowa women by a more comfortable   margin. Clinton earned 53 percent of Iowa women’s votes, compared to the 42 percent of women who voted for Sanders in that state. But in New Hampshire, that did not hold up, at all.    Madeleine Albright, the first ever female Secretary of State, told supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that ”there’s a special place in hell” for women who don’t help each other. (Reuters)   At the same time, let’s not oversell the importance of women in one state. In fact, there’s little about Clinton’s problems with female voters that clearly begin in 2016. In 2008, Clinton lost women to Barack Obama in Iowa, claiming 30 percent of the female vote, compared to Obama’s 35 percent. New Hampshire delivered a reversal of Clinton’s fortunes with women that year, with 46 percent of that state’s women casting a primary ballot for Clinton and 34 percent for Obama. Then, in South Carolina, a few weeks later, Obama won 54 percent of women’s votes and Clinton claimed a relatively small 30 percent. Are the tense and   days of the 2008 Democratic primary race beginning to come back to you now? Of course, this is not 2008. It is 2016, and Clinton faces a far different opponent with a different kind of platform. Clinton herself said during her New Hampshire concession speech Tuesday night, that she had some work to do to attract young voters (actually what we know is these are primarily young, white voters). Sanders, though, appears at this early juncture to be more polarizing for the genders than was Obama, who had clear and demonstrated appeal to female voters that often rendered a pretty small gender gap. In the early contests of 2008, men and women often voted for Clinton and Obama in similar numbers, rather than women tilting more for Clinton and men for Obama. Now, the gender gap is more real, so Clinton needs women. Still, there is likely one bit of modestly uplifting news for the Clinton campaign that can be gleaned from Sanders’s    performance in Iowa, overall win in new Hampshire and what appeared late Tuesday to be a victory in the contest for New Hampshire women’s votes. And that is this: The populations of New Hampshire and Iowa look nothing like those in South Carolina and Nevada.       In other words, Clinton has lost women before, and she may again. And while they’ll continue to be a big part of her base of support, the biggest demographic indicator of what happens from here on out is likely to be   voters.

","     There are many stories one could tell about Bernie Sanders’ defeat of Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire. One is that Sanders has captured the prevailing sentiment among Democrats, a fervent desire for political revolution to unmake a corrupt system, and he will ride this desire all the way to the nomination. Another is that yesterday’s result was a function of some idiosyncratic features of that primary, particularly New Hampshire’s demographic homogeneity and the fact that independents are allowed to vote in the party primary; now that the race moves to states that better represent the Democratic Party, Clinton’s strength among Latinos and   will move her back into command for good.    Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton emphasizes campaign finance reform and economic policy as she spoke to supporters after conceding to Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. (Reuters)   Either of those stories might be true. But right now, the Clinton campaign has a much bigger problem than the story it wants to tell about New Hampshire. That problem is this: the campaign has no story to tell the voters about Hillary Clinton and why she should be president. Having a good story doesn’t guarantee you victory, but nobody becomes president without one. The story has to contain three simple elements. First, it explains what the problem is. Second, it explains what the solution is. And third, it explains why this candidate, and only this candidate, is the person who can bring the country from where it is now to where it ought to be. As Greg discussed this morning, both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have very simple messages that are resonating with substantial parts of the base voters in each one’s party. Trump says that America is being played for chumps, and only a fantastic, luxurious individual like him can make us win again. Sanders says that the political system is corrupted by the influence of the wealthy and corporations, and a revolution delivered by an unsullied figure like him is necessary to break their stranglehold on our politics. Anyone who has paid attention to the campaign for five minutes understands what those messages are, whether you agree with either one of them or not. Now tell me: what’s Hillary Clinton’s message? She doesn’t have one. She doesn’t have a clear diagnosis of the problem the country faces, nor does she have an explanation of what the solution is, nor can she say why only she can bring about the better future voters are hoping for. Of course, Clinton can make a persuasive argument for her preferred solution on any policy area you can name. She also has a strong argument for why Sanders is being unrealistic about much of what he wants to do, an argument I basically agree with. And if you asked, she could tell you all about her ample qualifications for the presidency. But it doesn’t add up to a coherent story. What’s remarkable about this gaping hole in her candidacy is that she faced exactly the same problem eight years ago, and lost in part because she never solved it. Barack Obama told voters that our politics was being constrained by partisan bickering and small thinking, and only he, a new, inspiring figure, could forge consensus and bring the kind of change our future demanded. You might not think he succeeded in that, but at the time it was exactly what voters believed we needed. Far more than Obama’s specific policy ideas  —   which barely differed from Clinton’s at all  —   that vision and the way he embodied it was what drew first Democrats and then general election voters to him. I’m a little reluctant to make this critique, because reporters and pundits are often too eager to play political consultant and tell candidates and operatives how to do their jobs, when there are more important things we could be talking about. And candidates don’t need more encouragement to oversimplify things and reduce all the complexities of policy and politics to bumper   slogans. Nevertheless, the fact is that human beings understand the world through stories, which help bring coherence to complex situations. And there’s no reason a campaign can’t offer voters both lengthy policy plans and a simple, broad structure that organizes them into an understandable whole. Clinton’s campaign would argue that she has such a story to tell. In her speech in New Hampshire last night, she listed many of the problems she wants to solve and explained how she can solve them through commitment and hard work. Sources near to her tell Politico that now she will “push a new focus on systematic racism, criminal justice reform, voting rights and gun violence that will mitigate concerns about her lack of an inspirational message. ” That’s directed primarily at   the Democratic Party’s largest and most loyal constituency group, and the one no Democrat can win the nomination without. If Clinton can hold those voters, she can probably turn back Sanders’ challenge. But that’s far from guaranteed, and it’s a message that only addresses some of the problems the country faces. In contrast to broad ideas like Sanders’ call for revolution or even Trump’s claim that we’re a country of losers, it can’t be easily and logically applied to any problem a voter might see as urgent. And it doesn’t tell you much about Hillary Clinton in particular, other than the fact that this is something she cares about. There’s another successful presidential candidate we can remember who knew that being smart and experienced and having popular policy ideas wasn’t enough. His name was Bill Clinton, and he told the country that as an innovative thinker hailing from a place called Hope, this representative of a new generation could carry America out of its doldrums. He may have been more of a natural politician than his wife, but he also had a story to tell, one the voters found compelling. Hillary Clinton hasn’t told the country a story that connects their worries with her potential as a president. But she’d better find one soon.  "
209814,Hillary Clinton needs to figure out how to talk to women,Washington Post,Ruth Marcus,F,2016-02-10,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160211003009/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clinton-needs-to-figure-out-how-to-talk-to-women/2016/02/10/f01eefaa-d026-11e5-b2bc-988409ee911b_story.html
"," In a devastating outcome for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, this was the most unkindest cut of all: Women flocked to Bernie Sanders. Not by single digits, but by a margin of 55 percent to 44 percent.  These numbers matter, and not, as Shakespeare wrote of Brutus stabbing Caesar, because “ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, quite vanquish’d him. ” Clinton is not vanquished by what she and her supporters may see as female voters’ ingratitude; she will soldier on.   Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive   Facebook RSS   But moving forward, the candidate and her campaign need to figure out how better to speak to women, especially younger ones and those who are unmarried. In particular, they need to navigate the treacherous waters of celebrating the prospect of the first female president without sounding as if that is a qualification in itself. Or, worse, as if female voters tempted by Sanders are traitors to the feminist cause  —   Brutus to Clinton’s Caesar. Women are key to electoral success, especially for a Democrat. Not so long ago, analysts could debate whether the country was ready to elect a female president. Not anymore. If Clinton loses the nomination or the general election, she won’t have been defeated because she’s a woman. She’ll have lost despite that electorally helpful fact. Consider these numbers. Women accounted for 57 percent of Democratic   in Iowa, where they provided Clinton’s   margin of victory. They constituted 55 percent of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire. Even though Clinton did not garner a majority of support among women, according to network exit polls, female voters significantly softened Sanders’s win. Men backed him by an astonishing 67 percent to 32 percent.  Women similarly make up the majority of general election voters  —   53 percent in 2012. While Republican nominee Mitt Romney won the majority of male voters (54 percent to 46 percent for Barack Obama) women supported Obama (56 percent to 44 percent).  In short, in an unimaginable world in which women still lacked the right to vote  —   indeed, in a world in which women voted in fewer numbers  —   Clinton would stand no chance. “Her gender is still a very strong asset for this campaign,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. So what should she do? First, drop the argument,   and unconvincing, that gender is Clinton’s   calling card. “Honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment,” Clinton said at the most recent debate, and she’s made this point before.  Come on. The Clintons embody the Democratic establishment. Women know that. Instructing them differently just makes them feel as if they are being treated like fools by another typical politician. Second, stop the insinuations, subtle and explicit, that Clinton is the victim of sexism. Yes, the “Bernie bros” have tweeted ugly things. Yes, women who raise their voices face criticism that is not leveled at shouting men. But the Clinton campaign has been too quick to suggest sexism  —   more accurately, to leave it to their supporters to make those suggestions  —   when confronted with what is simply tough politics as usual.  Third, cut the  . It won’t only fail to convince younger women  —   it’s going to insult their mothers as well. Madeleine Albright was understandably frustrated about complacent young women who fail to grasp the significance of electing the first woman president, but the former secretary of state edged into offensive lecturing.  “So people are talking about revolution. What kind of a revolution would it be to have the first woman president of the United States?” Albright said. “We can tell our story of how we climbed the ladder, and a lot of you younger women [think] it’s been done. It’s not done. And you have to help. ” Then, the controversial part, “And, just remember, there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other. ”  This is true in general, and great advice on a Starbucks cup. It’s offensive in the specific context of instructing young women about their electoral obligation. Clinton would have been better advised to acknowledge this point than to dismiss it.  “Well good grief, we’re getting offended by everything these days,” she told NBC’s Chuck Todd, channeling her inner Trump. Not everything. Just suggestions that it’s a slap to the sisterhood to fail to support the female candidate. Feminism doesn’t mean imposing a moral obligation on women to vote a certain way. It means trusting them, not demeaning them, when they choose the candidate they like best, male or female. Even if their mothers disagree.

209854,Bernie Sanders’s claim that Hillary Clinton objected to meeting with ‘our enemies’,Washington Post,Glenn Kessler,M,2016-02-12,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160212235546/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/12/bernie-sanderss-claim-that-hillary-clinton-objected-to-meeting-with-our-enemies/
","     Sen. Bernie Sanders: “I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against   Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies. I have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality. ” Hillary Clinton: “Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. ” Sanders: “No, I think the idea was that president  —     Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It’s easier to talk to your friends. It’s harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both. ”  —   exchange during the Democratic debate hosted by PBS, Feb. 11, 2016 Some arguments never die. For readers who may not recall a pivotal exchange between  . Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, here’s what Clinton and Sanders are arguing about. In a debate on July 24, 2007 hosted by CNN, a question came to the candidates from YouTube: In 1982, Anwar Sadat traveled to Israel, a trip that resulted in a peace agreement that has lasted ever since. In the spirit of that type of bold leadership, would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries? Obama took the question first and answered emphatically yes: I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them  —   which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration  —   is ridiculous. Now, Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward. And I think that it is a disgrace that we have not spoken to them. We’ve been talking about Iraq  —   one of the first things that I would do in terms of moving a diplomatic effort in the region forward is to send a signal that we need to talk to Iran and Syria because they’re going to have responsibilities if Iraq collapses. They have been acting irresponsibly up until this point. But if we tell them that we are not going to be a permanent occupying force, we are in a position to say that they are going to have to carry some weight, in terms of stabilizing the region. Then Clinton responded, saying that before any such   meetings, diplomatic groundwork first would be necessary: Well, I will not promise to meet with the leaders of these countries during my first year. I will promise a very vigorous diplomatic effort because I think it is not that you promise a meeting at that high a level before you know what the intentions are. I don’t want to be used for propaganda purposes. I don’t want to make a situation even worse. But I certainly agree that we need to get back to diplomacy, which has been turned into a bad word by this administration. And I will purse very vigorous diplomacy. And I will use a lot of   presidential envoys to test the waters, to feel the way. But certainly, we’re not going to just have our president meet with Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez and, you know, the president of North Korea, Iran and Syria until we know better what the way forward would be. It’s worth noting that a third candidate on the stage, former senator John Edwards of North Carolina, backed up Clinton in his answer: “I think actually Senator Clinton’s right, though. Before that meeting takes place, we need to do the work, the diplomacy, to make sure that that meeting’s not going to be used for propaganda purposes, will not be used to just beat down the United States of America in the world community. ” The exchange became a flash point in the campaign, with Clinton later slamming Obama for being “naive” in an interview with the   Times: “I thought that was irresponsible and frankly naive to say he would commit to meeting with Chavez and Castro and others within the first year. As I said last night, there has to be a lot of diplomatic effort. ” The Pinocchio Test Sanders stated that Clinton in that debate opposed any discussions with “our enemies. ” But, in fact, she objected to any presidential meetings in the first year without preconditions, as she correctly stated. Moreover, as she noted, the approach Clinton outlined in the campaign turned out to be the one used by the Obama administration. Obama did not meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after he took office, though he did give U. S. diplomats more freedom to meet with Iranian officials than under the George W. Bush administration. A phone call between Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did not take place until 2013, when the two sides were deep in negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program. In other words, preconditions were set  —   and met  —   before a   conversation. Similarly, Obama did not have a substantive meeting with Cuban President Raul Castro (in 2015) until the two countries reached an agreement on normalizing relations, which included the release of an American detainee. Obama and Rouhani have never met, but that has not stopped opponents of Obama’s diplomacy from photoshopping images of an alleged meeting. Sanders earns Three Pinocchios. Clinton and Obama differed over whether to set preconditions, not about meeting with enemies. And it turns out that once in office, Obama followed the course suggested by Clinton, abandoning his earlier position as unrealistic.

"," Much of Hillary Clinton’s difficulty in this campaign stems from a single, unalterable fact: She is a woman. I’m not referring primarily to the Bernie Bros, those Bernie Sanders supporters who fill the Internet with misogynistic filth about Clinton. What drags down her candidacy is more pervasive and far subtler  —   unconscious, even.  Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation’s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. View Archive   Facebook Google+ RSS   The criticism is the same as in 2008: She doesn’t connect. She isn’t likeable. She doesn’t inspire. She seems shrill. “She shouts,” Bob Woodward said on MSNBC this month, also suggesting she “get off this screaming stuff. ”  Joe Scarborough, the host, agreed: “Has nobody told her that the microphone works?”  At that, Clinton supporters hollered  —   about the double standard that condemns her but not Sanders, who bellows at the top of his lungs. The episode was part of a constant stream of commentators (generally men) taking issue with Clinton’s demeanor and conduct  —   “She’s got to become herself,” David Gergen advised her on CNN before Thursday night’s debate  —   in a way they don’t do with Sanders.  At a Clinton rally last week in New Hampshire I discussed the decibel dilemma with Jay   of Time magazine. “It’s very hard for a woman to telegraph passion,” she explained. “When Bernie yells, it shows his dedication to the cause. When she yells, it’s interpreted in a very different way: She’s yelling at you. ”  That’s not about Clinton; it’s about us. “It is a subtle kind of sexism that exists that we don’t recognize,” said   who literally wrote the book on the matter. “Broad Influence: How Women Are Changing the Way America Works,” out last month, includes a chapter on Clinton. “When women raise their voices, people tend to get their hackles up. People I talk to at Clinton events put her in a maternal role: Why is she screaming at me? Am I in trouble?” Campaigning While Female also deprives Clinton of the ability to make lofty promises. Sanders, for example, has a $15 trillion   of a   plan. If Clinton floated such a plan, the media would mock it as patently absurd. But Sanders gets a pass. Why the double standard? “Men are the guys who want to go out and buy the motorcycle and women are the   holders,”   said. “It’s a very traditional role we are putting women into by making them the one saying, no, we can’t do all these really fun things. This is a very stereotypical box she gets put into, which then makes it very hard for her to be inspirational. ” This is the essence of Clinton’s trouble: If she can’t plausibly offer     and she can’t raise her voice, how does she inspire people? This hurts particularly with young voters  —   the same segment that shunned Clinton in 2008.  Clinton’s “likeability” problem also has something to do with her lack of a  . It’s a direct consequence of the imperative that she demonstrate her toughness. Men can be tough and warm at the same time  —   think Ronald Reagan  —   but for women, it’s a  . In 2008, she played down gender and positioned herself as “ready to lead on day one. ” This time she took a softer approach but eventually found herself back in the position of arguing that she’d be a better wartime leader than Sanders. For Clinton, “it’s a really tough needle to thread to be tough enough to be a commander in chief and still be likeable,”   said.  I disagree with those who scream sexism every time somebody criticizes Clinton. But there’s no denying that women are more often the victims of online savagery. That was true long before the Bernie Bros (who could be heard booing a mention of Madeleine Albright at Thursday’s debate). Sanders objects to the Bernie Bros but may encourage them when he talks about the “drama” Clinton creates and her “shouting. ” It’s also hard to imagine a male candidate being faulted for his wife’s misbehavior the way Clinton is blamed for her husband’s. There’s not much Clinton can do about this. But she can make the case that while Sanders talks “revolution,” her presidency actually would be one, because the first female president would govern differently from her 44 predecessors.  Clinton has been at the vanguard of the women’s movement for decades, but the movement has been so successful that young voters, even women, don’t realize how much has changed  —   and how having a woman as president could complete that Quiet Revolution.  “Women in general are better listeners, are more collegial, more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for   outcomes,” Clinton told   in “Broad Influence. ” Now that’s something worth shouting about.

209868,Is calling Hillary Clinton ‘angry’ or her voice ‘husky’ inherently sexist?,Washington Post,Callum Borchers,M,2016-02-12,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160212235546/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/12/is-calling-hillary-clinton-angry-or-her-voice-husky-inherently-sexist/
","     When is a word sexist and when is a word that could be construed as sexist simply, well, accurate? This is a tricky question the political press is grappling with  —   and will continue to  —   as Hillary Clinton wages a    campaign that increasingly requires her to draw sharp contrasts with her opponent in debates and on the campaign trail. When the former secretary of state makes a forceful argument, when she goes after Bernie Sanders, when she becomes animated, how should journalists describe her? One adjective that appeared in a Politico story Friday morning was “husky”  —   as in, “the last debate in New Hampshire was arguably Clinton’s worst  —   she wore her anger outwardly and seemed to deliver her lines in an aggrieved husky voice. ” That tripped the sexism alarm of at least one reader, who tweeted at author Glenn Thrush to say she has “never seen any reporter talk about a man’s voice. ” Thrush said the argument was nonsense (in slightly stronger terms) and cited Marco Rubio as an example of a male presidential candidate whose voice also has attracted media commentary.     “All the time” might be an exaggeration, but so is “never. ” Here’s what the New Republic’s Elspeth Reeve had to say about Rubio’s vocal quality just last week: His voice rises toward a yelp for emphasis, and his voice sometimes has a   quality. Even if you were never a bully, you kind of want to pick on him. The Twitter exchange between Thrush and the reader echoed a similar one from last week, which centered on a New York Times account of the same New Hampshire debate referenced by Thrush. Addisu Demissie, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, tweeted two excerpts from the Times dispatch  —   one stating that Sanders “largely kept his cool in the debate,” and the other painting Clinton as “tense and even angry at times. ” Demissie wrote that the contrasting passages were “offered without comment,” but the implication was clear: Clinton can’t get fired up without being called “angry” because she is a woman. Times reporter Nick Confessore, who did not write the piece, came to the defense of colleagues Jonathan Martin and Patrick Healy.   You could also consider the possibility that it is an accurate description of what actually happened. https:  .   —   Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) February 5, 2016  Accurate or not, Clinton made such a depiction very precarious last fall when, while discussing gun control, she memorably asserted: “First of all, I’m not shouting. It’s just when women talk, some people think we’re shouting. ” The remark was a response to Sanders’s saying there was too much ”shouting” on the issue of guns  —   after Clinton had attacked his record on that issue. (Sanders said his comment wasn’t sexist.) But Clinton was also issuing a warning to anyone who might think about characterizing her voice as some variation of    : Prepare to be called sexist if you do. It’s hard to deny the existence of some lingering institutional sexism in our political vernacular. Men and women  —   politicians and reporters  —   still use gendered terms to connote strength and weakness. The reason critiques of Clinton’s oratory can be seen as offensive is because they sometimes carry the suggestion that she’s not feminine enough  —   that she’s acting too much like a man. In other words, that her behavior is ”unbecoming,” as Mitt Romney once said of an attack by Shannon O’Brien during the 2002 gubernatorial race in Massachusetts.  Conversely, mockery of Rubio’s “ ” voice (or his “  booties”) implies that he’s just a little bit girly  —   which is, of course, presumed to be a bad thing. That’s why last month’s   was followed by a concerted effort by Rubio to prove his masculinity. So the question is not whether reporters remark on the voices of female and male candidates. They do. The question is whether remarks about either, or both, reinforce sexist stereotypes. It’s worth noting that Clinton doesn’t have a perfect record on this issue. Lost in the uproar this week over the revelation of an Atlantic writer’s transactional coverage of a 2009 speech by   of State Clinton is the highly gendered nature of the descriptor Clinton’s team required the reporter to use in exchange for an advance look at the speech: “muscular. ” To convey strength and power, a top Clinton aide demanded that her address be called “muscular.” If you think of Annie Thorisdottir when you read “muscular,” good for you. But I guarantee more people think of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson or any number of macho icons. The point, I think, is that journalists and the people they cover  —   including Clinton  —   should be thoughtful about word choice but also not conjure an offense where there is none. Sometimes Clinton does get angry. Sometimes she does shout. She wouldn’t be human if she didn’t, and it’s okay to call her outward displays of emotion what they are. But as journalists, we ought to check ourselves before typing those terms to make sure they are genuinely applicable and not influenced by latent, sexist mindframes that we’re too proud to acknowledge."

","     The Outrage Machine is a weekly opinion column by voices from the left and right on Washington.  RENO, Nev.  —   Nevada is still the new kid on the block when it comes to   status in the presidential race. But this year, the state could play a pivotal role on both sides. With the Democratic caucuses approaching on Feb. 20, followed by the Republican caucuses on Feb. 23, both contests have become increasingly intense, especially the pitched battle here between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. The Republicans are sending surrogates as South Carolina intervenes Saturday, three days before Nevada Republicans vote on their presidential preference. But both Democratic candidates spent the weekend in Nevada, and Clinton canceled events in Florida on Monday to campaign an extra day in the state, a clear sign her campaign is concerned about a place once considered a lock for her. It is a lock no more. [The Daily 202: Hillary Clinton could blow it in Nevada] The Clinton campaign had an early advantage in Nevada, setting up in the spring of 2015. She hired experienced operatives who know the state from their tenure on the Clinton and Obama campaigns in 2008. She did an event in Las Vegas last May, an effort to show she was even friendlier than the president on immigration reform and would use even more executive orders if necessary. The play was clear, the strategy solid. It seemed as if Team Clinton knew even then that Sanders would do well in new Hampshire and that she would need Nevada as a firewall to stop any momentum after the first two early states. And for about six months, it seemed Sanders did not even know Nevada was on the map. When his team finally arrived in October, Sanders’s campaign barely had an office and had no experienced Nevada hands. Within a few weeks, his campaign manager, who hails from New Mexico, had returned home and had to be replaced. The Nevada campaign was not in disarray because there really was no Nevada campaign. But that has all changed three months later. The new year brought new energy to Team Sanders as he used his fundraising prowess to start funneling resources into the state, opening offices, reaching out to Latinos, preparing for   Hampshire momentum. And now, buoyed by his landslide victory in New Hampshire, Sanders believes what would previously have been unthinkable: He could win here.    Nevada’s Democratic caucus is slated for Feb. 20. The race has emerged as an unusually important test for candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. (Reuters)   The Clinton panic is palpable. [In Nevada, a tightening race threatens Clinton’s   Hampshire firewall] Her staff repeatedly claimed that Nevada was as white as the first two early states. This was not only risibly false, but a clear sign that she wasn’t just lowering expectations but showing real fear she could lose Nevada. After Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid ( .) publicly criticized the Clinton campaign for making such assertions  —   he had argued for the state’s inclusion in the   lineup because of its diversity  —   Clinton contradicted her staff. This came amid a blizzard of events in the state for the former secretary of state to shore up her bases  —   unions, Latinos, African Americans  —   while also hosting events to try to cut into Sanders’s millennial cohort, including at a Reno community college on Monday. [In Nevada, Clinton hit from left and right on immigration] Clinton spent Monday in Nevada and sent her husband to fill in at Florida events after her campaign clearly sensed the firewall buckling here. There is a dearth of reliable public polling in Nevada, but no one on either side has asserted a victory is not within reach for Sanders. If he can make it in Nevada, Sanders can proffer the argument that he can win anywhere in America, not just in less diverse states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. And it could raise serious questions about Clinton’s ability to fend off an insurgent challenge that was once considered a lark. On the other hand, if she wins Nevada and then South Carolina, the entire dynamic shifts in her favor, halting the media narrative of the Sanders Surge. On the GOP side in Nevada, the Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio campaigns all are   but the question remains whether they can overcome the enthusiasm in the base for Donald Trump. Trump has held three rallies in Nevada, all enormously well attended, and some polling I have seen and heard about from credible sources shows him winning in a landslide. But the Nevada GOP caucuses are a strange animal. They’re on a Tuesday evening, last only four hours (and less in some counties) and turnout is expected to be under 10 percent. (In 2012, it was 8 percent). Rubio has done outreach to the important Mormon community, which will make up a significant percentage of the vote, and he has Mike Slanker and Jeremy Hughes, who helm the political operation of Gov. Brian Sandoval (R). Bush, as he does most places, has a raft of elected officials in his camp, and his effort is being run by Ryan Erwin, who won the last two caucuses here for Mitt Romney. Cruz came later but has the conservative rising star of the state, Attorney General Adam Laxalt, in his camp, and his effort is being run by Robert Uithoven, who also works for Sheldon Adelson. If Trump wins South Carolina by a lot, Nevada may not matter much because he should do the same here. But if not, this state could be interesting and may be the last gasp for Rubio and Bush as they strain to fill the Establishment lane.

209960,How Republicans may help Hillary Clinton make the Supreme Court more liberal,Washington Post,Greg Sargent,M,2016-02-16,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160217003532/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/02/16/how-republicans-may-help-hillary-clinton-make-supreme-court-more-liberal/
","     THE MORNING PLUM: Senate Republicans appear to be, if anything, closing ranks behind Mitch McConnell’s vow that the Senate will block anyone nominated by President Obama to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Even vulnerable Senate Republican incumbents are now rallying behind McConnell’s hard line. But in so doing, Republicans may be courting a pretty serious risk: if Obama doesn’t end up getting his pick through, there is a real possibility that President Hillary Clinton could nominate a more liberal replacement than Obama did  —   and she might also enjoy a Dem Senate majority, making it easier to get that more liberal replacement confirmed. Most analysts think that the outcome of the presidential race will play a substantial  —   though perhaps not decisive  —   role in determining the outcome of the most contested Senate races, many of which are taking place in key presidential swing states. And so, if Clinton does get nominated and then win the White House, that perhaps boosts the chances of Dems taking back the Senate, too. Former top aides to Obama believe he is likely to nominate a potential Scalia replacement who might have at least a marginal chance of getting some GOP support. (One potential nominee, Sri Srinivasan, is “considered a moderate,” has been praised by Republicans, and was confirmed to the D. C. Circuit by a   vote.) Obama might have a strong interest in picking someone with a chance of getting confirmed, since it would allow him to further shape the High Court before leaving office. On the other hand, President Hillary Clinton might end up being less constrained in terms of her pick  —   in 2017, Dems may control the Senate, or barring that, the GOP majority will likely be a lot slimmer. “If Republicans refuse to consider a nominee, they’re likely giving the next president much more leeway in selecting a justice and controlling the direction of the court,” Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, tells me. “That could mean a Republican president selecting a suitable heir to Scalia. But it could also mean a Democratic president nominating an  . ” Now, obviously, this may be a gamble  —   Adler calls it a “principled risk” and an “  bet on the future of the Court”  —   that Republicans are willing to take. Broadly speaking, the promise of keeping alive the possibility of a GOP president getting to replace Scalia with another conservative might weigh more heavily than the risk of getting a more liberal justice than Obama might nominate, since the court would be tilted in a more liberal direction under either Democrat’s nominee. Also, Republicans could presumably filibuster a Clinton nominee if they do lose the Senate, though they would be in a considerably weakened state after such a big loss, perhaps making that harder to sustain. McConnell may also be calculating that if Republicans do lose the White House, they could then quickly confirm Obama’s nominee. “If Obama makes a relatively moderate choice, and Republicans lose the election, don’t be surprised if there’s a lame duck confirmation, so Hillary doesn’t pick someone further to the left,” Adler notes. Of course, even if Republicans may have good reasons for refusing to consider and vote on Obama’s nominee, they may also have no choice. Even vulnerable Senate GOP incumbents such as Rob Portman of Ohio, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have rallied behind this new cause, even though, as Nate Cohn points out, opposing Obama’s pick could alienate the moderate voters in these swing states that might help determine their reelection chances. Yet they are digging in, surely in part because conservative groups are demanding that Republicans show maximum resistance to any Obama nominee. So this could end up unfolding as another example of the GOP base’s demands ultimately hurting the party over the long term. ******************************************************************* * TRUMP STILL DOMINATES NATIONALLY: The latest   Monkey poll finds that Donald Trump still holds a commanding lead among registered Republicans nationally: He has 38 percent, to 18 percent for Ted Cruz, and 14 percent for Marco Rubio. All the rest are in single digits. One big question is whether Jeb can post a very good showing in South Carolina to rescue his candidacy; in the new poll he’s at all of four percent nationally. Also: the percentage of Republicans who think Trump will win the nomination is up to 56 percent. * TRUMP, CLINTON DOMINATE SOUTH CAROLINA: A new Public Policy Polling survey finds Donald Trump with 35 percent in South Carolina, while Rubio and Cruz are tied for second place at 18 percent apiece. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders in the state by   perhaps illustrating the demographic challenges Sanders will now face. If Rubio comes in second in South Carolina, the roar of “ ” and “Rubio rebounds” punditry will be deafening. * HARRY REID TURNS UP HEAT ON REPUBLICANS: Dem Senate leader Harry Reid has a new piece in The Post blasting Republicans for signaling a refusal to vote on an Obama nominee to replace Scalia, arguing that it could render the Senate (even more) dysfunctional for years: If we enshrine this precedent and declare a functioning Supreme Court optional, subordinate to the whim of the Senate majority, it is easy to envision a future where the Supreme Court is routinely crippled. If my Republican colleagues proceed down this reckless path, they should know that this act alone will define their time in the majority  …    . they will be unconditionally surrendering their party to   presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Of course, this is a political fight, and the goal (in addition to prodding Republicans to consider a Scalia replacement) is to extract as much political pain as possible as long as they fail to do so. * SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED IN ELECTION YEARS: The New York Times has a useful chart that lays out this conclusion: Since 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed. But several of those were for seats that had become vacant in the previous year. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a successor from the time of nomination; on average, a nominee has been confirmed, rejected or withdrawn within 25 days.  If it is true that the Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a nominee, it’s worth noting that there are nearly double that number of days left in Obama’s second term. * HILLARY TO SPEAK ABOUT ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’: Hillary Clinton is set to deliver a speech today that is focused entirely on “systemic racism”: Her approach appears designed to highlight the contrast with her chief rival Bernie Sanders, who so far in his campaign has mainly addressed racism through the lens of economic inequality  …    . Clinton is expected to call for “new investments in job creation to ending redlining to ensuring equal pay for women of color to ending the    pipeline,” according to a campaign aide. Clinton is arguing to the more diverse electorates in coming Dem primaries that Sanders’s inequality focus is too narrow to address the problems that various Dem constituencies face. * AND REPUBLICANS PREP FOR BROKERED CONVENTION: Politico reports that GOP presidential campaigns are privately preparing for a possible brokered convention, should Donald Trump or Ted Cruz emerge at the top. Note this, from former RNC chair Michael Steele: “If they want to monkey around with this process and try to fix it, they’re asking for all hell to break lose,” he said. “Any inkling that state party officials or national party officials are colluding and conspiring to prevent a particular individual from getting the nomination,” he said, “will basically create Armageddon with the base. ” On the other hand, a Trump or Cruz nomination could prove even more disastrous for the party!"
210011,The economist who vouched for Bernie Sanders’ big liberal plans is voting for Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Jim Tankersley,M,2016-02-18,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160219000336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/18/the-economist-who-validated-bernie-sanders-big-liberal-plans-is-voting-for-hillary-clinton/
","     The first thing you should know about Gerald Friedman, the economist suddenly at the center of a   over Bernie Sanders’ policy proposals, is that he does not actually support Bernie Sanders for president. He likes Sanders. And he has written, in consultation with the Sanders campaign, an analysis that projects Sanders’ ambitious domestic agenda would raise economic growth to as high as 5. 3 percent per year, yielding sustained income gains for the middle class. But Friedman, an economist at the University of   says he’ll vote for Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. “I support Clinton,” he said in an interview on Thursday. “I donate $10 a month to Clinton. I remember the woman who said, women’s rights are human rights. I think she did a great job as secretary of state. I agree with Bernie on economic issues, but there are other issues. ”    Courtesy Gerald Friedman  Friedman came under attack this week by a group of liberal economists, including Austan Goolsbee, Alan Krueger and other former top economic advisers to Democratic presidents. They called his analysis of Sanders’ agenda  —   including free college for all, massive infrastructure spending and   health care, all funded through sweeping tax increases  —   “extreme claims” that “cannot be supported by economic evidence. ” Those economists didn’t reach out to Friedman before they released an open letter on Wednesday criticizing his analysis. If they had, he said, he would have happily adjusted his modeling to respond to their specific critiques. He also he would have explained that what he found, in what he calls his “orthodox” model of the Sanders plan, boils down to something many liberal economists have been saying for years: that the economy would respond strongly to a big new dose of fiscal stimulus. Friedman said he is revising his estimates now with more pessimistic assumptions about that response, but that he still expects the new numbers to show broad growth and income gains as a result of Sanders’ plans. Here’s why, according to Friedman’s analysis: Sanders’ spending would ramp up faster than the new taxes that would pay for it, which means the plan would, under this model, run big deficits in early years, and then big surpluses to offset them in later years. That would amount to a classic   fiscal stimulus, one that Friedman says would be larger than the Recovery Act signed into law by President Obama in 2009. Also, the taxes in the plan would redistribute income from the very rich to the   and the poor, who are more likely to spend the money and less likely to save it. In Friedman’s model, both those effects would boost growth  —   particularly because data suggest the economy still has a lot of ground to regain from the Great Recession, including workers to bring back into the labor force who have stopped looking for jobs. “The spending goes to working people, the taxes, a lot of them go to the very rich,” Friedman said. “We can have fast growth because we’ll be coming out of this deep recession, where there are a lot of underutilized or unutilized resources. ” He said those particular circumstances make the spending plans so potentially potent: “This program might not have been a good idea in 1998, when we were close to full employment,” he said. “It might not have been a good idea in 1968, when we were trying to slow the economy down. ” Some liberal economists this week endorsed the idea, at least in the abstract, that another big fiscal stimulus could boost growth. They include J. W. Mason, an economist at the progressive Roosevelt Institute. But Goolsbee isn’t swayed by Friedman’s arguments, which he has said risk pushing Democrats into the fantastical   projections that conservative economists  —   such as Arthur Laffer, who famously sketched a version of this idea on a cocktail napkin  —   say will follow large cuts in top income tax rates. In an email, Goolsbee said growth projections aren’t the only problem with Friedman’s analysis. It’s also his projections for income growth, for large effects from equalizing pay between men and women, for outsized savings on drug costs from the Sanders health plan, and more. Krueger said in an email that Friedman had, among other issues, dramatically overestimated productivity growth in the future, ignored ways in which Sanders’ programs would discourage some Americans from working and failed to account for the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would intervene to slow growth in a time of low unemployment in order to head off inflation. “To be clear, our letter wasn’t a critique of his study,” Goolsbee wrote. “It was a plea that we not invent a Vermont version of voodoo economics. If he wants to start using real economic data to analyze Sanders’ policies, that’s great. ” Goolsbee cited footnotes from the study, which contradicting a fear Friedman expressed in the interview: that the economists critiquing him had not read his work. He said he’d used straightforward, classic modeling tools to find his results. “It’s completely standard,” Friedman said. “I’m not sure if I knew another way to do it. Maybe if I’d done it on a napkin?”    The Fix’s Chris Cillizza breaks down why the Feb. 20 Nevada caucuses are a big deal for both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. (Peter   Washington Post)   "
210150,Hillary Clinton on ‘superpredator’ remarks: ‘I shouldn’t have used those words’,Washington Post,Jonathan Capehart,M,2016-02-25,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160226000401/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/25/hillary-clinton-responds-to-activist-who-demanded-apology-for-superpredator-remarks/
","         “Looking back, I shouldn’t have used those words, and I wouldn’t use them today,” Hillary Clinton told me in a statement when I asked her what she would have said to Ashley Williams, the activist who interrupted Clinton at a Charleston, S. C. fundraiser Wednesday night.  Unfurling a banner that read “We have to bring them to heel,” Williams wanted the Democratic presidential candidate to “explain for the record” why she “called black youth ‘superpredators’. ” Before Williams was escorted out of the event, she asked, “How come you didn’t address that in the prior debate?” Clinton replied, “You know what? Nobody’s ever asked me before. You’re the first person to ask me and I’m happy to address it. ” Clinton never got the chance to. Williams was gone.   So, I asked Clinton for a response. Here’s what she told me in full.  In that speech, I was talking about the impact violent crime and vicious drug cartels were having on communities across the country and the particular danger they posed to children and families.  Looking back, I shouldn’t have used those words, and I wouldn’t use them today.  My life’s work has been about lifting up children and young people who’ve been let down by the system or by society.  Kids who never got the chance they deserved.  And unfortunately today, there are way too many of those kids, especially in   communities.  We haven’t done right by them.  We need to.  We need to end the school to prison pipeline and replace it with a    pipeline.  As an advocate, as First Lady, as Senator, I was a champion for children.  And my campaign for president is about breaking down the barriers that stand in the way of all kids, so every one of them can live up to their   potential. “That speech” was a 1996 address at New Hampshire’s Keene State College in support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, otherwise known as the crime bill. In her remarks,   lady Clinton said, “They are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called ‘superpredators.’ No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel. ” This isn’t the broad brush Clinton’s critics today are accusing her of using 20 years ago. Despite Williams’s assertion that “I know you called black youth ‘superpredators,’” Clinton was clearly talking about a narrow band of young people who would not have included the admirably assertive Williams or the vast majority of African American youths then and now. And in light of the overarching fear of crime across the United States back in the 1990s, Clinton’s going out of her way to define “superpredator” as a kid with “no conscience, no empathy” is noteworthy.  Also noteworthy is Clinton saying then, “We can talk about why they ended up that way. ” I highlight that because Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) Clinton’s presidential campaign rival and then a member of the House, gave an impassioned floor speech in 1994 raising questions about cause and effect. Mr. Speaker, it is my firm belief that clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them. But it is also my view that through the neglect of our Government and through a grossly irrational set of priorities, we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence. The 1994 crime bill, the statute that many African Americans single out as the cause of mass incarceration of blacks over the past 20 years and that many in the criminal justice field view as a mistake, passed the House with 235 votes. Sanders joined 188 Democrats and 46 Republicans in voting “aye. ”    Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton at a Democratic presidential debate in Milwaukee, on Feb. 11. (Win   Images)  No one would question Sanders’s commitment to justice before or after he voted for the crime bill. Nor should anyone do the same to Clinton, who didn’t even have a vote. Sure, her words sting in the light of 2016, but they should not blind anyone to what she did before and after she uttered those 42 words in the span of 12 seconds. At the time Clinton was speaking, she was talking about body cameras, which is part of Clinton’s criminal justice platform that she first outlined in a major address last April. The same speech where she said, “It’s time to change our approach. It’s time to end the era of mass incarceration. ” Pushing Clinton on her past statements as Williams did is eminently fair. What isn’t fair is ignoring what Clinton promises to do to fix the glaring problems unleashed by a bill Sanders voted for and Clinton’s husband signed into law.

","     Hillary Clinton felt misunderstood. It was late 1994, Republican revolutionaries had stormed the House, and the first lady worried that it was her fault. Had she pushed too hard on   reform? Did voters resent her influence in her husband’s administration? During a meeting with confidantes in the White House residence, Clinton held back tears and contemplated stepping back from a visible role in politics and policy. Instead, she decided to reintroduce herself to America. “I realized I needed to tell my own story and define my own values in a format that could be evaluated directly by people without being distorted or mischaracterized,” she later explained. The result was her 1996 book, “It Takes a Village,” a meditation on the needs of children in the United States  —   and the closest thing we’ve ever had to a fully formed political manifesto from Hillary Clinton. After the humiliating failure of Hillarycare and her party’s midterm debacle, the book became a bestseller, her comeback.    The Washington Post’s Tom Hamburger explains how Bill and Hillary Clinton’s bond as a political team formed over time, starting with his 1974 race. (Sarah   Washington Post)   In the decades since, it has also become her touchstone, the argument she still reaches for when explaining her vision. “I believe the idea of the village and its shared responsibility for our children is even more essential today than it was in 1996,” Clinton wrote in the book’s 10th anniversary edition. She drew on it again during her first run at the Democratic presidential nomination, in 2008. “After all these years, I still believe it takes a village to raise a child,” she said in remarks before the Urban League, where she pledged, “as your president, to build that village. ” And Clinton returned to it in the speech launching her 2016 presidential campaign, calling for “an inclusive society”  —   or, she added, “what I once called ‘a village’ that has a place for everyone. ” As if we didn’t remember. In her debates with Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton has labeled herself “a progressive who likes to get things done,” suggesting ideology leavened by pragmatism. Though some of her views have no doubt shifted since she wrote the book  —   “evolved,” as politicians prefer to say  —   “It Takes a Village” shows Clinton striving, sometimes struggling, to reconcile those two impulses. The Clinton in these pages is a   moderate, but one who wants an activist government to drive social policy transformations. She is an advocate for equal rights, with a surprising streak of social conservatism. And in a preview of one of her current campaign’s big challenges, she dismisses   nostalgia for a bygone America yet fears that young Americans don’t recognize the sacrifices their elders once made for them. *** Clinton today frequently hails the country’s economic performance during her husband’s presidency, but “It Takes a Village” begins with a bleak view of the 1990s. “Everywhere we look,” she writes, “children are under assault: from violence and neglect, from the breakup of families, from the temptations of alcohol, tobacco, sex, and drug abuse, from greed, materialism, and spiritual emptiness. ” Parents are the first line of defense for their kids  —   feeding, teaching, nurturing, encouraging  —   but children “exist in the world as well as in the family,” Clinton explains. They depend on grandparents, neighbors, teachers, ministers, doctors, employers and, yes, politicians. “It takes a village to raise a child,” she writes. “I chose that old African proverb to title this book because it offers a timeless reminder that children will thrive only if their families thrive and if the whole of society cares enough to provide for them. ” The whole of society  —   that’s where Clinton’s vision quickly expands. Although she highlights the importance of nonprofits, faith communities, businesses, and international nongovernmental groups, “it takes a village” often becomes code for “it takes Washington. ” Clinton writes passionately about the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the Brady Bill, immunization campaigns, and other federal initiatives, deeming them essential to village life. “Let us stop stereotyping government or individuals as absolute villains or absolute saviors, and recognize that each must be part of the solution,” she writes. “Let us use government, as we have in the past, to further the common good. ” So what is the proper role for that government? Clinton identifies competing strands in American history  —   a collective “gratitude” for a government that promotes the common good, alongside a deep skepticism of authority evident in constitutional checks and balances and the Bill of Rights  —   and then claims the center. “Most of us would describe ourselves as ‘middle of the road’  —   liberal in some areas, conservative in others, moderate in most, neither exclusively   nor ” she writes. It may not be the vision of 2016 primary voters seduced by Sanders’s calls for political revolution, but it’s entirely consistent with Bill Clinton’s presidency, which, two weeks after the book’s publication, declared the era of big government over. [The moment Obama knew he would defeat Hillary Clinton for the 2008 nomination] On the economy, Hillary Clinton reflects the ambivalence that still dogs her as today’s Democratic voters consider her Wall Street ties. She emphasizes the importance of regulations for strong financial markets and job growth, yet she brags about how the Clinton administration eliminated 16, 000 pages of them. She blasts companies that lay off workers in the name of efficiency but adds that, “to be fair, while corporate restructuring is eliminating many jobs, the economy is also creating millions of new jobs, with small businesses starting at a record pace. ” Still, centrist rhetoric doesn’t stop Clinton from continuing the fight for her recently defeated cause of universal health care. “Many people believe that we cannot guarantee health care to all because of cost,” she writes. “In fact, a sensible universal system would, as in other countries, end up costing us less. ” But she laments the nation’s unwillingness to “commit ourselves to make affordable care available to every American. ” Today Clinton looks back with pride on her battles with the insurance industry, telling audiences that she fought hard and has “the scars to prove it. ” In her book, she appears defensive at times, the wounds still fresh. Though her push for reform, like Obamacare after it, was assailed as a paternalistic,    approach to social policy, in “It Takes a Village” Clinton also stresses the role of personal agency in staying healthy. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, she says. Teach kids to feel responsible for their own weight. Shut the refrigerator door and open the front door instead. “There’s probably no area of our lives that better illustrates the connection between the village and the individual and between mutual and personal responsibility than health care,” Clinton writes. This emphasis on personal responsibility is consistent with one of the more unexpected aspects of “It Takes a Village”  —   its socially conservative views of family, sex and popular culture. Though Clinton writes that children can thrive in multiple family structures, she argues that “the nuclear family, consisting of an adult mother and father and the children to whom they are biologically related, has proved to be the most durable and effective means of meeting children’s needs over time. ” She endorses uniforms in schools, calls for stricter codes for violence in movies and praises Tipper Gore’s efforts on warning labels for explicit music. Clinton also encourages sexual abstinence and wishes that young people would postpone decisions about sex until age 21  —   all views that may feel anachronistic in her party today but that placed Clinton near the center in the 1990s culture wars. She laments abortion among young people and says it’s a “national shame that many Americans are more thoughtful about planning their weekend entertainment than they are about planning their families. ” Clinton calls for more research into family planning and wider access to contraception, and she asserts that “women and men should have the right to make this most intimate of all decisions free of discrimination or coercion. ” But then, in odd phrasing for the   rights politician, she contends that “once a pregnancy occurs . . . we all have a stake in working to ensure that it turns out well. ” Perhaps most fraught in an America that has awakened to racial disparities in policing and criminal justice, “It Takes a Village” praises the 1994 crime bill for stopping “the revolving door for career criminals,” hails the presence of more cops on the streets and points approvingly to the rise of neighborhood watch groups. “It is realistic, not racist, to be cautious when walking through a   neighborhood, or to want to avoid a corner where a   shooting has taken place,” Clinton writes. “Such judgments become biased only when they are motivated by negative stereotypes rather than common sense. ” [Hillary Clinton reviewed Henry Kissinger’s latest book  —   and loved it] Finally, Clinton decries widespread divorce, characterizing it as a personal failing of couples who don’t try hard enough. “For a high proportion of marriages,” she writes, “ ‘till death do us part’ means ‘until the going gets rough.’ ” Clinton mentions her own efforts to keep her marriage together: “My strong feelings about divorce and its effect on children have caused me to bite my tongue more than a few times during my own marriage and to think instead about what I could do to be a better wife and partner,” she acknowledges. *** In her speech at the 1996 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Clinton drew heavily from “It Takes a Village,” linking its arguments to her family and, most important, to her husband’s reelection bid: For Bill and me, there has been no experience more challenging, more rewarding and more humbling than raising our daughter. And we have learned that to raise a happy, healthy and hopeful child, it takes a family. It takes teachers. It takes clergy. It takes busi ness peo ple. It takes community leaders. It takes those who protect our health and safety. It takes all of us. Yes, it takes a village. And it takes a president. . . . It takes Bill Clinton. Today, she is making that case for a different Clinton, in a different time. It’s a tough balance, embracing elements of that past presidency, discarding others and casting herself forward as her own person. Even in “It Takes a Village,” Clinton is conflicted about the past. She dismisses the “nostalgia merchants” who would like to take us back to a Norman   America, but she worries that young people don’t appreciate the   gains of those who came before. “When I look back on my childhood,” she writes, “I see how my mother and my girlfriends’ mothers worked to push open doors of opportunity for us. ” By contrast, she notes, younger Americans “don’t remember that many of the most important advances grew out of controversy and were achieved only after great effort. ” But others do remember, and Clinton’s recitation of those who have benefited from the village almost resembles a Democratic electoral coalition. “Our children may not remember, but older African Americans who could not eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels or vote in elections surely do. Women who were not admitted into certain professions remember. . . . Asian Americans who were told not even to apply for some jobs and Jewish Americans who were prohibited from buying homes in certain neighborhoods remember. Hispanic Americans who had no legal recourse against exploitative employers remember. Native Americans who lacked access to medical services before the expansion of the Indian Health Service remember. Men who went off to fight in World War II and were welcomed home by a grateful nation and the GI Bill of Rights remember. ” The dust jacket of “It Takes a Village” features a smiling Clinton, bathed in sunlight, surrounded by adorable children. They look 6 or 7 years old. They’re of all different colors, and they’re all laughing. The message is clear: These are the children Clinton fights for; the village she is building is for them. Two decades later, those kids are in their 20s. They’re the millennial generation. And they’re feeling the Bern.

210311,What does a former stafferâ€™s immunity deal mean for Hillary Clinton?,Washington Post,Matt Zapotosky,M,2016-03-03,2016.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001304/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/what-does-a-former-staffers-immunity-deal-mean-for-hillary-clinton/2016/03/03/0fbb6ab2-e15e-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html
"," The revelation that the Justice Department has granted immunity to a former State Department staff member who worked on Hillary Clinton s private email server is a likely indication that the investigation is nearing a conclusion, but should not be read as a sign that the leading Democratic presidential candidate is going to face criminal charges, legal experts said. That Bryan Pagliano  ” a 2008 presidential campaign worker who set up the server in Clinton s home  ” will avoid charges as he cooperates with FBI agents is a significant, if incremental, development, according to former federal prosecutors and   defense lawyers who have been following the case.  [Justice Department grants immunity to staffer who set up Clinton email server]  It could mean that Pagliano, concerned about his legal exposure, might implicate others, including Clinton. But it also could be an indication that agents and prosecutors are winding down an inquiry that will not result in charges, said Justin Shur, a former deputy chief of the Justice Department s Public Integrity Section who now works in private practice at the MoloLamken firm.  I don t know that I would necessarily jump to the conclusion that this person has  flipped,  and now they re going to say a bunch of incriminating things about other people, ? Shur said, adding that the agents could simply be making sure they have spoken to everyone relevant to the investigation. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the presidential campaign, said in a statement that Clinton has been cooperating with the Justice Department and offered in August to meet with officials. He said the campaign was  pleased ? that Pagliano, who invoked his Fifth Amendment rights before a congressional panel in September, was cooperating. It is unclear what level of immunity Pagliano received.  Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( ) chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson ( .) chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent a letter to the Justice Department Thursday requesting a copy of Pagliano s immunity agreement, noting they had previously asked that any such arrangement include a provision requiring him to cooperate with their investigation. Immunized witnesses can be critical. Prosecutors offered a generous immunity agreement to the businessman they said bribed former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell (R) and the businessman s testimony at trial was pivotal to demonstrating the corrupt bargain between the two. In Pagliano s case, FBI agents and federal prosecutors probably want to know about the conversations he had with Clinton or her aides when he set up the server, said Matt Kaiser, a     lawyer at Kaiser, LeGrand & Dillon.  It s an interesting development, ? Kaiser said.  I think they re going to push it as far as they can. They re going to want to know everything they can know before they make a decision to charge somebody or not. ?  [Clinton personally paid staffer to maintain server]  The New York Times reported Thursday that Pagliano had turned over security logs to investigators, and those logs showed no evidence of foreign hacking. The FBI is looking to wrap up the Clinton inquiry  ” a criminal investigation of the possible mishandling of classified information  ” in the coming months, according to a senior U. S. law enforcement official. There are no outward signs that prosecutors have convened a grand jury, a powerful tool that would allow them to subpoena witnesses. The issue of Clinton s use of a private email server was referred to the FBI in July after the Office of the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community determined that some emails on the server contained classified material. The State Department has said that 2, 093 of Clinton s emails released by the State Department contained some type of classified material, most at the lowest level of sensitivity, and that 22 additional emails were fully  top secret ? and were not released. Clinton and the State Department have said that none of the material was marked classified at the time it was sent, but Clinton has apologized and called her use of the private email account a  mistake. ? Many in the legal community have said it would be difficult to imagine her being charged. That is because the line between what is classified and what is not is  not inherently obvious, ? and charging the former secretary of state would require prosecutors to prove that she knew what she was handling crossed that line, said Barry J. Pollack, a     lawyer at Miller & Chevalier who defended convicted CIA leaker Jeffrey Sterling.  If something has not been deemed classified, you re asking a person to intuit how somebody else would make a subjective decision and hold that person responsible for the fact that they didn t anticipate that somebody else might view the document as classified, ? he said.  It s almost a Rorschach test. Different people view it differently. ?  [Why the Clinton email scandal and Petraeus leak are not really alike]  Spokesmen at the FBI and the Justice Department have declined to discuss the investigation. Pagliano s attorney, Mark J. MacDougall, also declined to comment on the immunity agreement. Edward B. MacMahon Jr. a lawyer who represented Sterling and   conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, said that although prosecutors probably could charge Clinton, politics may prevent them from doing so. Justice Department guidelines, he said, discourage prosecutors from bringing cases in such a way that they influence elections.  Almost anybody else already would have been receiving a target letter, ? MacMahon said.  Of that, there isn t any question in my mind. ? Jacob Frenkel, a     lawyer at the Shulman Rogers firm, said the immunity grant  raises exponentially the stakes in the investigation, ? although because of the secrecy surrounding the investigation, it was hard to know where it might lead.  This is a significant piece in providing clarity to an otherwise complicated jigsaw puzzle, ? Frenkel said,  and we do not know exactly where Mr. Pagliano s finger or fingers will point. ?

210400,What Bernie Sanders still doesn’t get about arguing with Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Janell Ross,F,2016-03-07,2016.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160308003241/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/07/what-bernie-sanders-still-doesnt-get-about-interrupting-hillary-clinton/
","       Oh dear. On Sunday night, Bernie Sanders was in the middle of explaining his rationale for having reservations about the 2008 auto bailout  —   too much of the aid went to Wall Street  —   when former secretary of state Hillary Clinton interrupted. Clinton got out a few words before Sanders, hand raised and moving in the (surprisingly tight) space between the two candidates and interjected. ”Excuse me, I’m talking,” he said. Now, compared to the rather raucous and raunchy content of the last GOP debate, that was not exactly a shocking or indecorous moment. It was comparatively mild  —   maybe somewhere just beyond inadvisable but far short of disturbing. And it might have faded away, as the latest example of one of many candidate responses to another candidate’s response to a debate stage question this cycle. But, alas, this was Bernie Sanders effectively shushing and brushing off the comments made by one Hillary Clinton. Clinton is the first woman with a serious shot at the Democratic presidential nomination, and therefore the first woman to spend this much time on debate stages with competition. And, this is the age of Twitter, where what feel like the independently formed opinions and reactions of ordinary voters are super easy to access. And indeed, there were many reporters who wrote about this moment by quoting and pulling in other reporters’ totally serious tweets. It all seems a bit light on substance and heavy on reaction  —   and reactions to reactions. And no one can climb inside Sanders’s mind and say with utter clarity what was swirling inside it. We do know that Clinton was the more experienced presidential debater on that stage. She also, by now, knows about Sanders’s, shall we say, tendency to respond to Clinton with curmudgeonly chastisements and finger wags. He has said and done a few things in previous debates that people have described as chauvinistic. By that logic, Clinton may have interrupted Sanders on purpose in hopes that something like the ”excuse me” moment would happen.   [Bernie Sanders wags his finger a lot, and people are starting to talk about it]   One could speculate a great deal about that. But then, there is this: Why, at this late date and this many debates into the 2016 presidential election cycle, has Sanders made demonstrably little to no effort to alter the way he interacts with the woman he at least strongly suspected he would be running against him from the day he declared his campaign? He has almost certainly had the same advice and information that every male candidate gets about the need to be constantly mindful about coming across like a chauvinist or a bully when on a debate stage facing a female competition. The challenge is twofold. First, there’s the way it appears to other people  —   to voters  —   who often recoil at these sorts of displays. This is a   fact. And voters have some ideas about how women should behave too. So don’t think Clinton is up on any debate stage and relaxed, while Sanders is the only one dealing with a minefield. Sanders has almost certainly been briefed on this research and had someone preparing him for debates try to identify the right way to manage Clinton’s interruptions. (Our suggestion: Try some version of ”Excuse me” or ”I would like to finish,” minus the hand gestures.) But the second is the one that may really be worth our collective time. That is: Does Sanders have the capacity to recognize the way these moments look or think deeply about the degree to which sexism propels his   performances? Whether that chauvinism is real or imagined or even toyed with by his opponent for political gain, why can’t Sanders find a better way to manage these moments? And, is some combination of all of the above something that a   presidential candidate has simply got to consider and manage effectively? Does the inability or unwillingness to examine his body language, tone and actions for hints or indicators of sexism  —   if not real but perceived by some women  —   tell us all what we really need to know?   [The real problem with Donald Trump retweeting those provocative pictures of Megyn Kelly]   Keep in mind that, if Sanders were to secure the Democratic nomination and then win the election, there are many female heads of state, foreign government representatives and others who are not men, with which Sanders will have to work effectively. It’s in many ways the very same reason to concern ourselves with Donald Trump’s debate stage and Twitter behavior and the methods and insults he’s adopted when attempting to confront women  —   journalists, political opponents and others. No one is saying Sanders and Trump are on equal footing in the terrain of public offensiveness or displays of sexism. But when it comes to women, Sanders and some of his supporters’ public behavior seem to inhabit a nearby Zip code. And the time where that kind of behavior  —   even hints of possibly sexist thinking  —   will be ignored or go unnoticed is probably long dead. Further reading: ‘Excuse me, I’m talking’: Bernie Sanders shuts down Hillary Clinton, repeatedly Bernie Sanders says white people don’t know what it’s like to live in a ‘ghetto.’ About that  …     The Hillary   Sanders clash over the auto bailout, explained The Hillary   Sanders race is becoming very predictable"
210426,"Fox News got Hillary Clinton out of her comfort zone, and even Democrats should be glad",Washington Post,Callum Borchers,M,2016-03-08,2016.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160309000140/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/08/fox-news-got-hillary-clinton-out-of-her-comfort-zone-and-even-democrats-should-be-glad/
","       Hillary Clinton never looked comfortable at Monday’s town hall event in Detroit, her first appearance on the Fox News Channel in almost two years. She stood   through much of her   session with moderator Bret Baier, and her exclamation at the end  —   “Oh, my gosh, it went by so fast!”  —   was thoroughly unconvincing. It had clearly been a grind. But the Democratic presidential   and her supporters should be glad she participated for what I assume is the very reason she was reluctant to do so: Fox pressed Clinton on issues that are important to many conservatives and managed to throw her  . That might sound like a bad thing for her, but the results were actually some of her best, most substantive responses of the campaign. Baier challenged Clinton to explain her position on abortion, something no moderator in any of the seven Democratic debates has done.   [Marco Rubio is right: The media should scrutinize Democrats’ abortion stances, too]   Baier: I want to ask you about a question I asked Senator Sanders. Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it’s born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy? Clinton: Well, again, let me put this in context because it’s an important question. Right now, the Supreme Court is considering a decision that would shut down a lot of the options for women in Texas, and there have been other legislatures that have taken similar steps to try to restrict a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. The Supreme Court case, while topical, had little to do with the question. Clinton went on to talk about defending Planned Parenthood  —   another tangent. These were talking points, not answers, so Baier tried again.   [Supreme Court hears arguments on Texas   case]   Baier: Just to be clear, there’s no  —   without any exceptions? Clinton: No. I have been on record in favor of a   regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother. I object to the recent effort in Congress to pass a law saying after 20 weeks, you know, no such exceptions, because although these are rare, Bret, they sometimes arise in the most complex, difficult medical situations. Baier: Fetal malformities and . .. Clinton: . .. And threats to the woman’s health. Baier: Sure. Clinton: And so I think it is  —   under Roe v. Wade  —   it is appropriate to say, in these circumstances, so long as there’s an exception for the life and health of the mother. Now we’re getting somewhere. Clinton didn’t want to mention her support for   abortion restrictions, but Baier forced her hand with his  . And she ought to be happy that he did. When Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) complained in a February debate that Democrats haven’t been pressed on their abortion stances, he also said Clinton ”believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.” That’s not accurate, but Clinton can’t debunk that kind of false attack if she never talks about the abortion restrictions she favors. Later in the town hall, Baier raised the issue of Clinton’s private email use as secretary of state. When he did, Clinton reverted to one of her favorite arguments: ”Nothing I sent was marked classified or that I received was marked classified.” If only it were that simple. Any voter who has followed the story knows that the State Department, as it released Clinton’s emails in batches, redacted more than 2, 000 messages because they contained classified material. Without further explanation, Clinton’s response looks like an outright lie. Baier pushed for a clarification.   [State Department releases final batch of Clinton emails]   Clinton: Well, what I’m saying is, it wasn’t [classified] at the time. Now, if you  —   let’s take Mary Smith who has some information in the government. And she is FOIAed  —   Freedom of Information Act  —   give us your information, your memos, your emails, whatever it might have been. That then goes through a process. So even though the agency she works in has none of this as classified, others start to have a chance to weigh in. So others might say, you know, that wasn’t at the time, but now with circumstances, we don’t want to release it, so, therefore, we have to classify it. It wasn’t a perfectly smooth answer, but it conveyed a point Clinton should make more often: Yes, many of the emails on her private server are now classified, but they were not at the time she sent or received them. Clinton might prefer to say ”nothing was classified” and have the argument end right there. But that’s just not realistic. Forced to provide a more nuanced answer, she might have actually delivered an explanation that will satisfy some Fox News viewers who view her skeptically. Clinton probably didn’t win hordes of conservative converts Monday, but she answered tough questions in a way that might at least make some temper their disdain and that might appeal to independents. That’s worthwhile. That’s why she should do this more often. "
210458,Why Hillary Clinton is unlikely to be indicted over her private email server,Washington Post,Ruth Marcus,F,2016-03-08,2016.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160310000345/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-hillary-clinton-is-unlikely-to-be-indicted-over-her-private-email-server/2016/03/08/341c3786-e557-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html
"," For those of you salivating  —   or trembling  —   at the thought of Hillary Clinton being clapped in handcuffs as she prepares to deliver her acceptance speech at the Democratic convention this summer: deep, cleansing breath. Based on the available facts and the relevant precedents, criminal prosecution of Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails is extraordinarily unlikely. My exasperation with Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state is   and unabated. Lucky for her, political idiocy is not criminal.  Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive   Facebook RSS   “There are plenty of unattractive facts but not a lot of clear evidence of criminality, and we tend to forget the distinction,” American University law professor Stephen Vladeck, an expert on prosecutions involving classified information, told me. “This is really just a political firestorm, not a criminal case. ”  Could a clever law student fit the fact pattern into a criminal violation? Sure. Would a responsible federal prosecutor pursue it? Hardly  —   absent new evidence, based on my conversations with experts in such prosecutions. There are two main statutory hooks. Title 18, Section 1924, a misdemeanor, makes it a crime for a government employee to “knowingly remove” classified information “without authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location. ”    The State Department released 52, 000 pages of Hillary Clinton’s emails as part of a   process. Here’s what else we learned from the publicly released emails. (Monica   Washington Post)    Prosecutors used this provision in securing a guilty plea from former CIA director David H. Petraeus, who was sentenced to probation and fined $100, 000. But there are key differences between Petraeus and Clinton.  Petraeus clearly knew the material he provided to Paula Broadwell was classified and that she was not authorized to view it. “Highly classified . . . code word stuff in there,” he told her. He lied to FBI agents, the kind of behavior that tends to inflame prosecutors.  In Clinton’s case, by contrast, there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified. Second, it is debatable whether her use of the private server constituted removal or retention of material. Finally, the aggravating circumstance of false statements to federal agents is, as far as we know, absent.  The government used the same statute in 2005 against former national security adviser Sandy Berger, who was sentenced to probation and fined $50, 000. Here, too, the conduct was more evidently egregious than what the public record shows about Clinton’s. Berger, at the National Archives preparing for the   investigations, twice took copies of a classified report out of the building, hiding the documents in his clothes.  For Clinton, the worst public fact involves a 2011 email exchange with aide Jake Sullivan. When she has trouble receiving a secure fax, Clinton instructs Sullivan to “turn [it] into nonpaper [with] no identifying heading and send nonsecure. ” But Clinton has said she was not asking for classified information. In any event, it does not appear her instructions were followed.  Another possible prosecutorial avenue involves the Espionage Act. Section 793( d) makes it a felony if a person entrusted with “information relating to the national defense” “willfully communicates, delivers [or] transmits” it to an unauthorized person. That might be a stretch given the “willfully” requirement.  Section 793( f) covers a person with access to “national defense” information who through “gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust. ” The government has used the “gross negligence” provision to prosecute a Marine sergeant who accidentally put classified documents in his gym bag, then hid them in his garage rather than returning them, and an Air Force sergeant who put classified material in a Dumpster so he could get home early.          The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we’ve learned from them.    Caption   Clinton has come under fire for using a private email address during her time as secretary of state. The emails are being screened and released in batches.

210482,Univision’s Ramos picked the wrong Benghazi question for Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Erik Wemple,M,2016-03-10,2016.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160311000724/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/03/10/univisions-ramos-picked-the-wrong-benghazi-question-for-hillary-clinton/
","     Jorge Ramos chose flash over substance. In last night’s   Post Democratic presidential debate, anchor Ramos went straight after former secretary of State Hillary Clinton over one of the key issues in the last presidential race. “I want to continue with the issue of trust. Secretary Clinton, on the night of the attacks in Benghazi, you sent an   to your daughter Chelsea   …    ” said Ramos. That ellipsis? It represents booing from the crowd at Miami Dade College. Benghazi needs no introduction with political audiences around the country. Anyhow, Ramos plowed through, noting that Clinton had emailed Chelsea Clinton to say that   “was responsible for the killing of the Americans. ” Over more booing, Ramos trudged onward, saying that “some of the families claim that you lied to them”  —   especially Patricia Smith, the mother of State Department official Sean Smith, who died in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2012. Ramos played a clip of Patricia Smith on Fox News saying that “Hillary and [President] Obama and [  Secretary Leon] Panetta, [Vice President Joe] Biden and [U. S. permanent representative to the U. N.] Susan Rice all told me that it was a video when they knew   …     it was not the video. ” Those comments by Patricia Smith have played into the   accusation that Obama administration officials, in the immediate aftermath of Benghazi, attempted to blame the attacks on an   video instead of terrorism  —   as part of a scheme to insulate themselves from criticism in advance of the 2012 presidential election. Responding to a Benghazi accusation requires a detailed tour through one of the most investigated incidents in U. S. diplomatic history. Clinton answered with words of sympathy for Patricia Smith, whose grief “I certainly can’t even imagine. ” Then she said Patricia Smith was “absolutely wrong. ” The talking points then rushed forth: Clinton pointed out that the officials cited by Patricia Smith were “scrambling” to figure out Benghazi in those hazy days in   2012; that she’d testified on Capitol Hill last fall for 11 hours about these events; and that Benghazi was politicized unlike other tragedies in which the United States lost personnel overseas. Pressed pointedly by Ramos on why she had sent an email to her daughter about   (actually, an “  ” organization) yet tell grieving families about a video, Clinton replied, “At the time I   with my daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi. Within 16, 18 hours, they rescinded taking credit. They did it all on social media. And the video did play a role,” said Clinton. “We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that. ” The question by Ramos reaches back to that   hearing in October, when Clinton answered lawmakers’ questions about her Benghazi actions, again. And it tracks on a claim from Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) that Clinton is a “liar” for the apparent contradiction in her statements. That claim itself has stirred a   whirlwind, from The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler, Breitbart’s John Nolte and the Weekly Standard’s Mark Hemingway. Holding the former secretary of state accountable for how she characterized an attack that killed four U. S. personnel is a worthwhile undertaking. It does make a difference. None of which is to say that it’s the best Benghazi question for Clinton at a nationally televised debate where there’s little time to hash out the intricacies of   Benghazi intelligence. Here’s the best question: Ms. Clinton, a study that you yourself commissioned found that our diplomatic compound in Benghazi was unprepared for the attacks of Sept. 11, 2012, despite having sustained attacks in previous months and operating in a cratering security backdrop. When Diane Sawyer of ABC News asked you whether you wished you had acted differently, you said in part, “I take responsibility, but I was not making security decisions. ” Is that the sort of leadership you will bring to the White House? Just a suggestion. "
210800,Hillary Clinton broadly denounces Cruz and Trump on national security: ‘Loose cannons tend to misfire’,Washington Post,Abby Phillip,F,2016-03-23,2016.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160324000157/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/03/23/hillary-clinton-broadly-denounces-cruz-and-trump-on-national-security-loose-cannons-tend-to-misfire/
","       In the wake of the deadly terror attacks in Brussels, Hillary Clinton laid out a stark contrast between her approach for dealing with the Islamic State threat and that of the two leading Republican presidential candidates, businessman Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, in a   speech at Stanford University on Wednesday. The Democratic presidential candidate’s remarks were both a repudiation of Cruz ( .) and Trump, and an effort to further stake out a forceful foreign policy stance that addresses heightened American anxiety about security. ”America does not cower in fear or hide behind walls. We lead and we succeed,” Clinton said. ”Throughout our history we have stared into the face of evil and we have refused to blink.” Clinton’s focus on the two candidates in the number 1 and number 2 spots in the Republican race reflects a broader pivot to the general election that could pit her against either man. She has long focused much of her attention on Trump, whose rhetoric about Muslim refugees and talk about building walls on the United States’ southern border have prompted widespread condemnation from Democrats. On Wednesday, Clinton sought to direct a similar scrutiny to Cruz, whose rhetoric she described in terms that she has in the past typically reserved for Trump. “Slogans aren’t a strategy,” Clinton said in comments aimed at both leading GOP candidates. “Loose cannons tend to misfire.” The attacks in Brussels’s targeted   “soft targets”  —   an airport and train station  —   killing at least 31. The Islamic State claimed responsibility, raising fears that plots to execute similar attacks in the United States could be on the horizon. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Tuesday that officials have “no specific, credible intelligence of any plot to conduct similar attacks here in the United States. ”   [Trump questions need for NATO, outlines noninterventionist foreign policy]   The attacks prompted   responses from Cruz and Trump, who have both been critical of the Obama administration’s response to the Islamic State and have called for restrictions on refugees entering the United States from predominantly Muslim nations. Point for point, Clinton denounced Cruz and Trump, who have called for  —   among other things  —   bans on the entry of Muslims into the United States, patrols of Muslim neighborhoods, and a reevaluation of the United States’ participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On Tuesday, Cruz proposed increased surveillance of Muslim neighborhoods, citing a defunct New York City counterintelligence program as a model for the type of surveillance that he believes is necessary. “We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant   or ISIS presence,” Cruz said in a statement on Tuesday. “We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized. ”    Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivers a counterterrorism address at Stanford University on March 23, 2016 in Stanford, California. (Photo by Justin   Images)  Clinton said Cruz’s proposal would treat ”American Muslims like criminals,” and she called the suggestion ”wrong,” ”counterproductive” and ”dangerous.” Clinton said the Islamic State threat requires a multifaceted approach against an enemy that has proven its ability to mobilize and spread propaganda online. And she argued that rather than withdrawing from existing alliances, the United States must bolster them  —   particularly to aid Europe in stemming the flow of jihadist fighters to and from the Middle East. “When other candidates talk about walls around America, I want to ask them, how high does the wall have to be to keep the Internet out?” Clinton said. In an interview this week with The Washington Post’s editorial board, Trump suggested that the United States should reevaluate its investment in NATO. Trump has in the past said the United States should pull back its engagement in foreign conflicts to reinvest in the domestic economy. Clinton savaged the suggestion, saying that Trump was proposing to turn the United States’ alliance with NATO countries into a ”protection racket” that would ”send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike.”   [Ted Cruz calls for law enforcement to ‘patrol and secure’ Muslim neighborhoods]   ”If Mr. Trump gets his way, it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin,” Clinton said. ”It will make America less safe.” ”NATO in particular is one of the best investments the United States has ever made,” Clinton said. Looking beyond the Brussels attacks, Clinton used her remarks to denounce the foreign policy views that have been espoused by Republican presidential candidates for months. She addressed Trump’s support for torture and Cruz’s suggestion that the United States could defeat the Islamic State by   areas that might include civilians. Cruz’s suggestion ”doesn’t make you sound tough, it makes you sound like you’re in over your head,” she said. On foreign policy, Clinton has cultivated a hawkish reputation that puts her to the right of some Republican candidates on policy, including Trump. But Republicans have accused her of being the architect of a ”leading from behind” strategy as secretary of state that they say has characterized the Obama administration’s approach to the world. As a presidential candidate, Clinton has expressed support for a more aggressive role for the United States in foreign affairs  —   particularly in combating terrorism in the Middle East. ”America is a great nation and this is a time for American leadership: smart, strong, steady leadership,” Clinton said. ”No other country can rally allies and partners to defeat ISIS. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale.”"
210801,A Bill Clinton gaffe reveals a Hillary Clinton strength,Washington Post,Carter Eskew,M,2016-03-23,2016.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160324000157/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/03/23/a-bill-clinton-gaffe-reveals-a-hillary-clinton-strength/
","     Michael Kinsley once said, “A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth. ” I was reminded of that yesterday when I read that Bill Clinton recently told voters that they should support his wife, “if you believe we’ve finally come to the point where we can put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us and the seven years before that. ” (As a reminder, the last seven years were brought to us by the man whose mantle his wife wears like a shawl: President Obama.) The Clinton campaign instantly went into “cleanup in Aisle 7” mode and clarified that the former president was referring to the Republican obstructionism of the last eight years, not any failures of the Obama presidency. This hardly qualifies as a controversy, especially at a time when the grim reality of the world once again intrudes on the inanity of our politics. But there is truth in the  ’s gaffe nonetheless. Perhaps no president could have dented the bulwark of Republican obstructionism in the past eight years, but a selling point for Hillary Clinton should be that she is pragmatic and persistent and will work the levers of power with perhaps less grace, but more skill than the current president. In other words, she should say that she may not be the most agile of politicians, but she’s a seasoned fighter who knows how to charm, cajole and compromise her way to progress. And no matter how many times you knock her down, she will get back up with another idea and path to making the country better. As has been noted by many, even those who support him, Obama lacks these qualities. He excels at laying out a vision for a proposal, if you happen, as I do, to already agree with him. When rebuffed, he rightly blames the Republicans. But then, too often, he gives up and tries to impose his will unilaterally through the impermanence of executive order.  So I think this is the truth buried in Bill Clinton’s gaffe: Hillary Clinton has the persistence and insider skills to make Washington work better. This message doesn’t fit very well with the angry, outsider,   of the current campaign, but it may grow in appeal as we get closer to actually electing a president who will have to confront, among other things, a very dangerous international situation. And, as Bill Clinton knows very well, to quote another political cliche (attributed to Mario Cuomo): “You campaign in poetry; you govern in prose. ” "

","     It has been more than a year since the infamous news conference at the United Nations, at which Hillary Clinton falsely asserted, “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material. ” For a year the Clinton campaign has raised a number of specious excuses: “It was allowed”; other secretaries did the same (not true); the emails were only retroactively classified (not true); there was no risk classified information might have been compromised (unfounded); and her offenses were not serious (highly questionable). If it was not previously, even the most loyal Clinton supporters should by now recognize the seriousness of her problems. The FBI does not assign 147 people to investigate something trivial, “allowed” or lacking national security implications. If it was obvious that no case against Clinton existed, the FBI would not have methodically gathered information and waited until the end or nearly the end of the investigation to interview the main culprit. That’s exactly what occurred here: The interviews by FBI agents and prosecutors will play a significant role in helping them better understand whether Clinton or her aides knowingly or negligently discussed classified government secrets over a   email system when she served as secretary of State. The meetings also are an indication that much of the investigators’ background work  —   recovering deleted emails, understanding how the server operated and determining whether it was breached  —   is nearing completion. “The interviews are critical to understand the volume of information they have accumulated,” said James McJunkin, former head of the FBI’s Washington field office.  “They are likely nearing the end of the investigation and the agents need to interview these people to put the information in context. They will then spend time aligning these statements with other information, emails, classified documents, etc. to determine whether there is a prosecutable case. ” If the FBI had determined, like so many Clinton defenders, that there was no there, its agents would not bother interviewing the former secretary of state and now Democratic presidential  . If there was no pattern of deliberate evasion of classification rules, Clinton would not now be potentially facing legal jeopardy. But, as The Post reported, Clinton was determined to avoid administration directives even about her BlackBerry. (“From the earliest days, Clinton aides and senior officials focused intently on accommodating the secretary’s desire to use her private email account, documents and interviews show. ”) Her contempt for the rules that the lowliest government employee must abide by suggests a shocking indifference to the law and the rationale behind security measures. (“Throughout, they paid insufficient attention to laws and regulations governing the handling of classified material and the preservation of government records, interviews and documents show. They also neglected repeated warnings about the security of the BlackBerry while Clinton and her closest aides took obvious security risks in using the basement server. ”) If it was not her intent to compromise national security, it is certainly fair to say it was her intent to ignore restrictions associated with her BlackBerry and private server.      The State Department released 52, 000 pages of Hillary Clinton’s emails as part of a   process. Here’s what else we learned from the publicly released emails. (Monica   Washington Post)   With the   investigation reaching its conclusion, Clinton’s fate  —   likely the outcome of the 2016 presidential race  —  rests in the hands of the FBI, the one agency arguably beyond the political influence of Clinton or the administration. Should it criticize or point out lapses of judgment in her conduct without recommending prosecution, she will likely continue her march to the nomination. In a general election against Donald Trump, even Republicans may find that as egregious as her lapse in judgment may have been, the danger inherent in a Trump presidency is so great that the country would be better off in her hands than his. Should the FBI find, however, that she either intentionally compromised classified material or was negligent in her handling of classified material, it will be compelled to refer the case for prosecution. At that point it may make no difference politically if the Justice Department proceeds or not (although career Justice Department officials would be wary about the perception of covering up or ignoring evidence of a crime). The finding by the FBI that there is the basis for prosecution in and of itself would make her candidacy problematic in the extreme. (Would President Obama pardon her? What would happen if she were elected and then indicted?) The potential for FBI action, incidentally, should influence her VP pick, if it comes before a final decision by the FBI. With the FBI’s action hanging over her head, the VP pick had better be someone who could plausibly win without her   govern in her absence; choosing an inexperienced lightweight for electoral concerns may no longer be an option. Better to look for a current or former senator or governor who could beat Trump, if need be. (California Gov. Jerry Brown?) As the potential for a Trump nomination increases, a great number of Republicans who will never vote for Trump (in large part because of his unsuitability to serve as commander in chief) may be faced with the unimaginable. Clinton has become the safety cord to pull, the least horrible of two horrible alternatives and at least a   commander in chief, they reason, if Trump captures the GOP nomination. What if their backup plan, Hillary, gets knocked out by the FBI and there is no third candidate? (Rueful voters may be asking themselves, Just because Clinton messed up with her server, does the country deserve to get stuck with Trump?) The potential for a   Sanders or  ’s VP pick general election should panic both Democrats and Republicans. Perhaps Vice President Biden’s staff should start figuring out how to parachute into the Democratic National Convention. He may be the backup to the backup for despondent voters."

"," “What we are seeing is   cognitive dissonance,” a   former Democratic official told me. Hillary Clinton has effectively secured her party’s nomination, in part through an embrace by superdelegates who demonstrate that the Democratic establishment is far more privileged than its toothless, gouty Republican counterpart.  But then, instead of consolidation, humiliation.   Michael Gerson is a nationally syndicated columnist who appears twice weekly in The Post. View Archive   RSS   Clinton has lost six out of the last seven Democratic contests. Her opponent, Bernie Sanders  —   a socialist and only recently a Democrat  —   has exceeded her fundraising totals for the past three months. Some of Clinton’s losses have been blowouts, like her   defeat in the Washington caucuses. In the Wisconsin primary, Sanders won 82 percent of voters under 30 and 83 percent of those who most value the quality of honesty in a candidate. He narrowly beat Clinton among women and won independents by more than 40 points.  And this outpouring of support for Sanders has come for a candidate who has all but lost. At least in this universe. Clinton needs only   of the remaining Democratic delegates to secure the nomination, in electoral territory that grows more favorable.  Clinton is inevitable. But this is inevitability without affection  —   the inevitability of a glacier, not a movement.   Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton is not ”qualified” to be president because of the donations she accepts from the fossil fuel industry, while Clinton questioned whether Sanders’s ideas are realistic. (Peter   Washington Post)   The counterfactuals, in this case, are instructive. If the field of Democratic establishment candidates had been broader  —   including, say, Joe Biden, John Kerry and Jerry Brown  —   Sanders might be in Donald Trump’s situation, leading for the nomination with a strong plurality. If the Sanders slot had been filled by a more electable progressive  —   say, Elizabeth Warren  —   Clinton would be toast.  Why is an impeccably qualified candidate who is winning her party’s nomination so politically feeble? Some of this is just raw political skills, or the lack of them. Clinton  —   who is engaging and   in small groups  —   does not translate well to a big rally setting. Her attempts at intensity get mixed reviews. “She is out of her element,” the former Democratic official told me. “But lurking underneath these concerns are questions: What is she really about? What is her core? What is she willing to fight for? So far, this is an antiseptic campaign. ” For evidence, let’s go to Clinton’s descriptions of her own cause. Recently on “Morning Joe,” she summarized her appeal: “I’ve been in the trenches a long time. ” That is quite a slogan to win over the youngsters. Elsewhere she said: “I think that should be the way people judge who the next president they want to see in the Oval Office is, because at the end of the day, producing results is really what it’s all about. ” This is a purely instrumental description. Lawn mowers produce results. Drain cleaners produce results. A preacher with that sense of mission would have an empty collection plate. The absence of a clear mission raises questions about Clinton’s motivations. Her leftward tack on a variety of issues  —   opposing the   Partnership, opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, supporting the breakup of the big banks  —   has removed the last hints of 1990s New Democrat Clintonism, at least for the moment. She seems to be running as a candidate who happens to have all of Barack Obama’s views (except, perhaps, on Syria). What, other than the desire for power in her own experienced hands, explains her political relentlessness? This is the context in which 59 percent of Americans, in a recent   News poll, do not judge Clinton to be honest and trustworthy. This doesn’t mean they wouldn’t leave her alone with the cash drawer. Rather, this represents a belief that the main cause of the Clintons is the Clintons themselves, and that a variety of rules get bent in service to that cause. It is sometimes claimed that Hillary Clinton is a Teflon figure; that nothing  —   not her email troubles, not her foundation troubles, not her Benghazi troubles, not her FBI troubles  —   sticks to her. This is true if it means that no single scandal has knocked her out of the race. But there has been a cumulative effect  —   a gradual oxidation that has left a layer of rust. For the purposes of this election, none of this is likely to matter. Republicans seem utterly determined to lose a perfectly winnable race. But it is not a small thing, or a good thing, that Americans seem prepared to elect a president they do not trust.

","   Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association and the Parental Rights Organization.   Democrats have approached the 2016 presidential election with great confidence, arguing that changing demographics will guarantee them victory. By this, they mean the growing number of African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans expected to vote in November.  However, other dramatic changes in the electorate over the past 30 years give Republican candidates an advantage. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has insulted  —   and telegraphed her plans to damage the issues important to  —   these groups of Americans. Clinton began her political life in the late 1970s, and her understanding of who votes and why predates the emergence of these voting constituencies  —   in some cases by decades.   : Thirty years ago, home schooling was illegal in almost every state. Today, all 50 states allow home schooling, and about 2 million children  —   nearly 4 percent of   students  —   are  . Ten million Americans have been   at some point in their lives.   and their families make a great sacrifice, usually taking one parent out of the job market. They   as “ . ”   believe Clinton and the modern Democratic Party would like to regulate home schooling out of existence to please the teachers unions.  Charter school supporters: There are nearly 3 million students in public charter schools, an educational choice not available before 1992. Clinton has been endorsed by teachers unions, which see as a top priority bringing unionized teachers and work rules into public charter classrooms, destroying the very educational environment that parents of charter school students fought to win for their children. Paraphrasing Al Shanker, the former president of the American Federation of Teachers, the kids cannot vote. Their parents can. These children and their parents live in cities, and often in swing states.    permit holders: When Bill and Hillary Clinton were promoting gun control in 1993, the “gun lobby” was imagined by liberal politicians as limited to hunters in rural areas. Easy to ignore, they thought. But now 42 states have enacted laws that grant any honest citizen the right to carry a gun. Nearly 13 million Americans have   permits. Carrying a gun is a personal decision, a big part of many people’s lives. But in the March 6 Democratic presidential candidates debate, Hillary Clinton said, “I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. ”  This is an insult to the 13 million Americans who have decided to take upon themselves the task of protecting themselves and their families. Perhaps Clinton thinks she can ignore those whom some liberals consider rubes living in square states out west. But let’s look at swing states in 2016: Florida has about 1. 4 million   permits, Pennsylvania 1 million, Michigan 600, 000, Ohio 460, 000  and Colorado 160, 000.   Fracking workers: It has historically been an easy decision for Democrats to insult and belittle the oil and gas industry. Energy workers lived in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Alaska  —   unlikely states for a Democratic presidential candidate to win. But the emergence of fracking has opened up oil and gas exploration in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Try winning 270 electoral votes while threatening to damage the nearly 186, 000 energy jobs in Ohio, almost 73, 000 jobs in Pennsylvania and more than 100, 000 jobs in Colorado. Again at the March 6 debate, Clinton made this    threat: “By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. ”   Users of   and vapor products: Vaping, an alternative to smoking cigarettes, was not around 10 years ago. Today, more than 9 million Americans vape. They have shifted from smoking cigarettes to a healthier lifestyle. They are proud of their transition. These voters defeated Elizabeth Thomson, a Democrat in the New Mexico House who pushed for tax increases and regulations on vaping. President Obama’s Food and Drug Administration is moving to essentially kill the vaping industry through regulations, and Sen. Ed Markey ( .) the Carrie Nation of the new prohibition movement, has said, “The   industry should be put out of business. ” If you doubt that this is a   issue, ask someone who vapes.   Uber drivers and others in the sharing economy: There was no Uber before 2009. Today, there are 400, 000 Uber drivers who take at least four trips a month. Clinton has announced that she wants to “crack down” on independent contractor laws that allow Uber and the entire sharing economy to exist. Why? Unions don’t like laws that allow Americans to work independently. They don’t pay dues. Clinton wants you to have a boss. Add to Uber drivers those Americans who know what Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Instacart and Postmates are. Clinton watched her husband run for the presidency and win in 1992 and 1996. But that was before vaping, fracking, Uber,   charter schools and home schooling became prevalent in the United States.   Read more:   E. J. Dionne Jr.: Can Hillary Clinton find her spark?

","     NEW YORK  —   Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders won the Wyoming caucuses on Saturday, continuing a winning streak against   Hillary Clinton as the two head for a key showdown next week in New York. The senator from Vermont has now defeated Clinton in the past seven of eight states that have held nominating contests. However, Sanders’s margin of victory, which stood at 55. 7 percent to 44. 3 percent with all precincts reporting, provided no help in his larger quest to catch Clinton in the race for the nomination. Only 14 delegates were at stake Saturday, and under the party’s complicated caucus rules, Sanders was awarded seven delegates, and Clinton was awarded seven. Sanders nevertheless claimed momentum from the contest. ”It is beyond debate that the momentum in the campaign is with us,” he told reporters after a rally in Queens. During the rally, Sanders announced from the stage that he had just won Wyoming, prompting an extended standing ovation. Sanders has generally performed better than Clinton in caucus states, and the electorate in Wyoming mirrored that of some other Western states where Sanders has done well: It is largely rural and white. Unlike in some other states where Sanders has prevailed, the Wyoming contests was closed to independent voters, who tend to break in Sanders’s direction.   [Sanders ties his advocacy for a ‘moral economy’ to the work of Pope Francis]   In a statement Saturday night, Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, congratulated Sanders ”on a spirited campaign in Wyoming” but said Clinton had outperformed expectations, stressing the tie in pledged delegates. Heading into Saturday, Clinton held a commanding lead in the overall delegate count. The Clinton campaign put the margin at about 200 delegates, while Sanders’s campaign said it was 214 by its count. Clinton also maintains a huge advantage among superdelegates, the Democratic elected officials and other party leaders who get a say in the nomination and are not bound by the results of their states. Sanders made a campaign stop Tuesday in Laramie, Wyo, where he held a rally in the college town on the night of his victory in the Wisconsin primary. Clinton didn’t campaign in the state but dispatched her husband, Bill, the former president, to stand in for her. Sanders’s wife, Jane, also made some campaign stops on his behalf. In recent days, both Sanders and Clinton have largely turned their attention to New York, where 247 delegates are at stake on April 19. To catch Clinton among pledged delegates, Sanders will have to win most states remaining on the nominating calendar by large margins.

","     NEW YORK  —   No group of voters has been more loyal to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary than black voters. Yet she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, spent an entire day courting black voters in half a dozen New York churches and at a campaign event in Baltimore. Why? The effort comes after a week in which the long relationship between African American voters and the Clintons needed some reinforcements. ”This is a historic day,” said Rep. Charles B. Rangel ( . Y.) as he introduced Bill Clinton at Antioch Baptist Church in Harlem on Sunday morning. ”What makes it so important is that we have a chance to thank the Clinton family.” It was a reminder that perhaps seemed necessary after last week, when a group of Black Lives Matter protesters once again raised an old and thorny issue that has dogged the Clintons in this campaign, specifically their support for a 1994 crime bill. The protesters took issue with   lady Hillary Clinton’s use of the term ”super predators,” which is now believed to have been coded racial language targeted primarily at black urban youth who had been caught up in drugs and violence.   [Bill Clinton gets heated with Black Lives Matter protesters over his crime bill]     about 20 years, and Hillary Clinton has expressed regret for using the term, but Bill Clinton last week defended the crime bill and objected to protesters criticizing his wife for using a term that at the time targeted drug dealers and killers. The episode launched a thousand reprisals of the debate over whether the Clintons were truly contrite about the unintended consequences of the crime bill, which some blame for codifying a culture of mass incarceration that has decimated African American families. So the former president made his pilgrimage to three black churches, pillars of the black community in Harlem, on Sunday morning. Rangel reminded the congregation that Hillary Clinton pressed her husband during his presidency to include Harlem as an economic empowerment zone so it could receive economic development funding. And that Bill Clinton, after finishing his presidency, chose the neighborhood to house his presidential foundation’s office.   [Bill Clinton ‘almost’ apologizes for arguing with Black Lives Matter protesters]   But Bill Clinton was also in Harlem to express a little more contrition that seemed to be lacking in his fiery defense of the crime bill in Philadelphia last week. ”Not all our problems are economic. We need police reform. . .. One of the things Charlie Rangel helped me to get was more police on the street who looked like the people they police,” Clinton told the congregation at Abyssinian Baptist Church. ”We need prison reform. We overdid it and put too many young, nonviolent offenders in jail for too long.” Across town, Hillary Clinton also spent the morning    as she often does    in black churches in New York City. She defended President Obama’s legacy and recounted how he asked her to serve in his administration. She also addressed criminal justice reform. “We need to end the era of mass incarceration and make sure we divert people from going into prison in the first place” and help people coming out of prison as well, Clinton said at New Greater Bethel Ministries in Queens. For Clinton, the timing of these church visits happened to be just right, but black churches are like a second home to the former first family. The Clintons are regularly greeted with a hero’s welcome in them, and they have become regular guests over the years. (”This is a woman that I have faith in.   …     This is not her first time in this place,” said the Rev. Floyd Flake of Greater Allen AME Cathedral of New York in Queens.) Speaking to a spirited audience in Baltimore later in the day, Clinton accepted the endorsement of Rep. Elijah E. Cummings ( .) and emphasized her proposals to boost economic development in predominantly African American communities in Baltimore and elsewhere. On Sunday alone, the Clintons were backed by Rangel, Rep. Gregory W. Meeks ( . Y.) and, later in Baltimore, by Cummings    all of them black lawmakers and community leaders who have regularly helped both Clintons among black voters nationwide. ”One of the things that meant so much to me, Madam Secretary, is one of the first speeches that you made when you were about to launch your campaign to make sure that every single citizen has an unimpeded right to vote and have their vote counted,” said Cummings, a native son of Baltimore. ”So that’s Hillary’s road, the road that will lead our nation forward. The road that will bring us much closer to a more perfect union.” ”I’m following that road, and I’m following it with Hillary Clinton,” he added."
211217,Republicans know Hillary Clinton is not going to be indicted. They just can’t say so.,Washington Post,Paul Waldman,M,2016-04-11,2016.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160412001127/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/04/11/republicans-know-hillary-clinton-is-not-going-to-be-indicted-they-just-cant-say-so/
","     If you’ve spent any time inside the conservative information bubble, among the things you know is that not only did Hillary Clinton commit all manner of nefarious crimes with relation to the emails she sent and received as Secretary of State, but she will be indicted for those crimes soon, and that indictment will throw the 2016 to the Republican presidential nominee. If you inhabit the world outside that bubble, you may know that the chances of such an indictment are infinitesimal. But conservatives hold on to the possible indictment like a life raft amid swelling seas, the one thing that can save them from the horror of a Clinton presidency.  So it was that when President Obama agreed to be interviewed by Fox News Sunday for yesterday’s broadcast, host Chris Wallace had to get him to weigh in on the matter. Obama’s answer was pretty much what you would have expected, but it was the panel discussion afterward that was most revealing. Here’s how Obama answered Wallace’s first question: “I’ve got to be careful because, as you know, there have been investigations, there are hearings, Congress is looking at this. And I haven’t been sorting through each and every aspect of this. “Here’s what I know: Hillary Clinton was an outstanding Secretary of State. She would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy. “And what I also know, because I handle a lot of classified information, is that there are  —   there’s classified, and then there’s classified.  There’s stuff that is really top secret top secret, and there’s stuff that is being presented to the president or the secretary of state, that you might not want on the transom, or going out over the wire, but is basically stuff that you could get in open source. ” Wallace then pressed Obama on whether he would exercise any influence over the investigation, and he guaranteed (multiple times) that he wouldn’t. Although Obama’s answer might not be all that revealing to the uninitiated, he actually touched on the most critical questions with regard to an indictment. First, the classified material in question was not marked classified at the time it was sent and received; it was only afterward that the intelligence agencies retroactively classified it, which is critical to any legal case against Clinton. Second and most important, in order to be charged with the crime of mishandling classified information, the person has to knowingly and intentionally make the information available to someone who doesn’t have authorization to receive it, or act with such extraordinary negligence that it would inevitably fall into the wrong hands. So for instance, David Petraeus got charged because he showed top secret documents to his mistress (and then lied to the FBI about it). But there’s no evidence that Clinton did anything even remotely similar. That’s why, when Politico’s Josh Gerstein examined prior cases similar to this one, he concluded that an indictment is highly unlikely. As Gestein writes: The relatively few cases that drew prosecution almost always involved a deliberate intent to violate classification rules, as well as some   element: An FBI agent who took home highly sensitive agency records while having an affair with a Chinese agent; a Boeing engineer who brought home 2000 classified documents and whose travel to Israel raised suspicions; a National Security Agency official who removed boxes of classified documents and also lied on a job application form. The only person with something resembling expertise in this area Gerstein could find who would say Clinton ought to be indicted was the increasingly loathsome Rudy Giuliani, whose opinion on matters like this is worth about as much a ticket to one of his inspirational speeches. (There’s a lengthier examination of the legal issues in this article by law professor Richard Lempert, if you’re interested.) Just to be clear, I’m not defending Clinton’s decision to set up her own email server. That was a violation of departmental policy, and she shouldn’t have done it. But that’s very different from saying it was a crime, or even that it jeopardized national security in some way. (There’s been no evidence that Clinton’s server was hacked or that anyone even tried to hack it, unlike the State Department’s own systems, which are constantly targeted by hackers.) But if you’re a Republican pundit, you know that the idea of Hillary Clinton being led away in handcuffs is just too tantalizing for your audience to resist. And so when the Fox News Sunday panel (consisting of two conservative Republicans and two objective reporters, which is their idea of balance) had the chance to weigh in, the conservatives  —   Karl Rove and The Post’s George Will  —   expressed the proper degree of faux outrage at Obama. What’s most interesting about their comments (here’s the transcript) is that neither one of them even tried to make a case that Clinton should be indicted. Instead, they both brought up former IRS official Lois Lerner, to argue that the Obama Justice Department engages in   of criminal behavior. They implied, without saying outright, that the Justice Department would never issue indictments that would damage Democrats (such as Hillary Clinton). For the most part, the Clinton email story has been a disappointment to Republicans. They were desperately hoping that the emails would reveal some kind of ghastly malfeasance on Clinton’s part, some smoking gun that would make all Americans realize that she should never be elected president. When that turned out not to be the case, they pinned their hopes on the idea that she would just have to be charged with a crime eventually. I have no doubt that people like Will and Rove now understand that that isn’t going to happen either. But having gone this far, they need to keep up appearances, and they also know that just talking about her emails serves to convince people that something scandalous must have happened. So they are laying the groundwork to argue, if and when she doesn’t get indicted, that it must only be because Barack Obama’s corrupt administration quashed the investigation and hid the truth from the public. And down where the conservative rank and file get their information  —   the talk radio rants, the   blogs, the breathless chain emails  —   these two contradictory ideas are both widely circulated. Clinton is about to be indicted, and Clinton won’t be indicted because the fix is in. The assumption in either case is that of course she committed crimes, even if no one can say exactly what they were. Because she’s Hillary Clinton, right? What more do you need to know?"
211221,Hillary Clinton’s secret weapon against Bernie Sanders: Democratic voters,Washington Post,Greg Sargent,M,2016-04-11,2016.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160412001127/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/04/11/hillary-clintons-secret-weapon-against-bernie-sanders-democratic-voters/
","     THE MORNING PLUM: Bernie Sanders made the rounds on the Sunday shows reiterating his   argument: He, not Hillary Clinton, is the candidate best positioned to take on Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. It’s true, as Sanders says, that a number of polls show him performing better against them in general election   though the significance of this is an open question. This argument from Sanders, however, is crucial to understanding this new ad from Hillary Clinton that attacks Donald Trump by name, going hard directly at Trump’s xenophobia, demagoguery and chauvinism. The ad will air in New York City, home to around three million registered Democrats:      Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign released a video attacking Republican contender Donald Trump and urging New Yorkers to vote in the April 19 Democratic primary. (Hillary Clinton)   This ad signals that Democrats will be free to go much harder at Trump than are his GOP rivals, who have been constrained from doing so by the inconvenient fact that a lot of GOP voters agree with Trump’s more wretched prescriptions and pronouncements. Dems speaking to a general election audience will not be similarly constrained. But this ad also says something important about the remainder of the Democratic primaries, particularly the New York primary, which is set for April 19th. Many of them are closed to independent voters, meaning only registered Democrats can vote. In New York, Alex   reports that Sanders supporters have worked hard to register new voters (who might be more inclined to vote for him) as Democrats, but that their efforts may have fallen short, because of the state’s overly restrictive voting rules: There is no   registration in the state. Independents or members of third parties who want to vote as Democrats had to change their party registration by October 9. And new voters  —   another key Sanders voting bloc  —   had to register by March 25  …    . While state officials reported an unprecedented surge in new voter filings just ahead of last month’s deadline, overall voter growth was disappointing.  As of April 1, Democrats had added about 14, 000 people to their rolls (out of close to 6 million registered voters) since the same day last year, according to Board of Elections data. Sanders supporters say they’ll be able to compensate for this problem by “  turnout among young people and other key Sanders groups,”   reports. And that of course could happen. But throughout these primaries, Clinton has fared far better than Sanders in closed contests, in part because she wins among Democrats while Sanders wins among independents. (Sanders won in Wyoming over the weekend, but in this closed caucus the delegates ended up getting split evenly.) Much of what you’re seeing right now from the Clinton campaign is best understood with this in mind. It helps explain why Clinton has taken to calling out Sanders for not being a Democrat. And it also helps explain the contours of the argument the two candidates are now having about electability.   [Republicans know Hillary Clinton is not going to be indicted. They just can’t say so.]   Sanders argues not just that general election polling shows him to be the stronger general election pick for Democrats, but also that his ability to win independents positions him better against any GOP nominee. This argument raises legitimate questions about Clinton’s potential weaknesses as a general election candidate, and the Clinton camp has not, to my knowledge, responded to it convincingly. But the Trump ad above hints at how the Clinton camp expects Democratic voters to view the dispute over electability. After noting that Trump has said we should “punish” women who have abortions and has called Mexican immigrants “rapists,” it concludes: “With so much at stake, she’s the one tough enough to stop Trump. ” The Clinton camp is betting that Democratic voters in particular have a deep well of historical memories of her at war with Republicans for more than two decades, and that as a result, they will conclude that she should be entrusted with the task of defeating Trump, given how horrifying the prospects of a Trump presidency really are. *********************************************************************** * BERNIE HIGHLIGHTS BROOKLYN ROOTS: The Daily News reports that the Sanders campaign is airing a new ad in New York that highlights his push for free college and a $15 minimum wage: “Values forged in New York,” the ad’s narrator says as footage plays from a recent rally in the South Bronx where 18, 500 cheering supporters gathered. “ . Native son who knows what we know: We are all in this together. ” “New York  —   what makes it think bigger? Go bolder?” the narrator asks. “You do. ” Sanders sees winning Brooklyn as central to his hopes in the state, because nearly one million registered Democrats live there. * HILLARY CRUISING IN NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA: New Fox News polls find that Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by   in New York and by   in Pennsylvania. Two tidbits: In New York, Clinton leads among every demographic except men and voters under 45. In Pennsylvania, she holds a wide lead among union voters.  The polling averages have Clinton up by similar or larger margins in both. Sanders would probably have to win Pennsylvania by seven and New York by four, while winning by large margins everywhere else, to close the delegate gap.  * TRUMP CRUSHING IN NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA: The new Fox News polls also find Donald Trump leading John Kasich and Ted Cruz in New York by    and leading them in Pennsylvania by   . This once again suggests Trump is headed for terrain that’s very favorable to him. Meanwhile, Nate Cohn explains how Trump can still win the nomination outright if he racks up very big delegate margins in the northeastern states, followed by big wins in places like Indiana and California. * TAKING NOMINATION FROM TRUMP COULD HURT GOP: A   poll released over the weekend asked Donald Trump supporters what they would do if he wins a plurality of delegates but the nomination is given to someone else at a contested convention:   percent said they would vote for the candidate who eventually wins the nomination, while the remaining third were split between a number of alternatives such as not voting, supporting a   candidate, and switching parties and voting for the Democratic nominee.  One third say they’d shun the GOP nominee. That’s probably overstated, but this hints at how much damage to the GOP Trump could do if he decided to (but he’d never do that, would he?)  * WHY REPUBLICANS ARE LEARNING TO LOVE TED CRUZ: Bloomberg Politics reports that Republicans are beginning to see Ted Cruz as their best and most likely alternative to Trump. Despite Cruz’s obvious flaws, here’s the upside that GOP strategists see:   Republicans are beginning to realize that their last chance for a white knight may be Cruz, who, for many, is the original nightmare candidate. These strategists believe that, while the party may lose the presidency and the Senate with Cruz as the nominee, they’ll be in a better position to hold on to the House,   their incumbent governors and protect their state legislative majorities. By this logic, he is a way to avoid the existential threat to the party posed by Trump’s outsider campaign. A Cruz nomination gives vulnerable GOP lawmakers someone they can support without embarrassment, someone who might not cause millions of GOP voters to stay hoome. Of course, if Trump decides to wreak as much havoc as possible, that might do the same thing. * A HILLARY INDICTMENT? PRECEDENT SUGGESTS OTHERWISE: Politico’s Josh Gerstein has an excellent look at previous cases in which the mishandling of secrets was prosecuted, concluding that Clinton’s case is unlikely to be one of them: The relatively few cases that drew prosecution almost always involved a deliberate intent to violate classification rules  …    . former prosecutors, investigators and defense attorneys generally agree that prosecution for classified information breaches is the exception rather than the rule, with criminal charges being reserved for cases the government views as the most egregious or flagrant  …    . some experts on national security law  …    . noted that none of the information was marked classified and that there’s no indication she was trying to send classified information to anyone not authorized to look at it. Nonetheless, it remains a certainty in some quarters that some sort of email revelation that will destroy her candidacy is eternally just around the corner.  * AND HILLARY BEATS TRUMP ACROSS A RANGE OF ISSUES: A new Associated Press poll finds that Clinton is favored over Trump on issues such as health care, immigration, and international relations. And: Clinton has a slimmer lead over Trump on which candidate is trusted to protect the country, with 37 percent backing the Democrat and 31 percent backing the Republican  …    . Much of Trump’s appeal with voters has rested on his broad pledge to “make America great again. ” But when asked which candidate they trusted more to make the country great, 33 percent of Americans picked Clinton and 28 percent backed Trump. Clinton is more trusted than Trump on national security and on “making America great again”? So Trump’s ubiquitous baseball hat emblazoned with that slogan is not enough to persuade general election voters? Oh well.

","   Kareem   is an author, commentator and former professional basketball player.   There is a tradition in U. S. politics of somberly proclaiming that each election is The Most Important in History. The idea, of course, is to scare people into voting for some candidate or another. This is done by describing an apocalyptic future like some sadistic camp counselor telling horror stories at bedtime with a flashlight under his chin. In making this assertion so frequently, we run the risk of sounding like the boy who cried wolf, and therefore not being taken seriously when an election comes around that really is important to American history.  As this one is. This isn’t because we have a female candidate who may be her party’s nominee. That would be historically significant, as was electing Barack Obama as the first black president. His race and her gender inform who they are, as any person’s cultural background does, but it’s policies that maketh the politician. And it’s policies that make me endorse Hillary Clinton for president of the United States.   From Snoop Dogg and Tim Allen to Tila Tequila and Ronda Rousey, here’s a look at some of the unexpected celebrity endorsements this election season. (Gillian   Washington Post)   Before I get into the reasons I support Clinton, let me first explain why this election really is so important. On Aug. 8, 1945  —   two days after the bombing of Hiroshima  —   Albert Camus wrote an essay warning future generations about the choices before them: “This is no longer a prayer but a demand to be made by all peoples to their governments  —   a demand to choose definitively between hell and reason. ” That is what the stakes of this election are: We are choosing between hell and reason. America was founded on the principles emanating from the Age of Reason, also known as the Age of Enlightenment. But today, with the rise of Republican candidates such as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, we are witnessing a rejection of these foundational ideals in favor of a hellish chaos of lies, misdirection, attacks on the Constitution and, most harmful to the country, a rejection of reason. This last item is especially evident in Trump’s continued dominance despite the fact that so many   people in his own party have vigorously rejected his inflammatory rhetoric, empty promises and lack of knowledge. I’m frustrated and angry at hearing about frustration and anger toward Washington gridlock as an excuse for embracing candidates who will only add to the problem. But that’s what is happening with Trump and Cruz supporters. These voters share a distrust of experts, preferring “the wisdom of ordinary people. ” Really? I prefer the wisdom of a trained physician when I have pain in my chest. One of the problems in Washington is that some legislators ignore the experts, such as the international community of scientists who have studied and confirmed global warming, so as to bury their heads and do nothing. When did we start devaluing intelligence and knowledge?  That’s why electing Clinton is important not just to maintaining the integrity of the United States but also to preventing an international trend that threatens to unleash a triumph of hatred and fear over reason. We are in a defining battle between the resurgence of the irrational, and all the horrors that have historically gone with it  —   violence, bigotry, fascism  —   and reason, with all the advances that have accompanied it  —   justice and freedom for all, regardless of ethnic background, social status, gender or sexual orientation. I like Bernie Sanders, both for his   populism and the dedication to the welfare of all Americans in his heart. He’s a decent man with the courage of his convictions. He will make a strong ally for Clinton. But Clinton possesses that rare but crucial combination of idealism and pragmatism. She can both envision a better world and take the necessary steps to make that vision a reality. She embodies the principles of the Age of Reason and isn’t afraid to fight against the confederacy of dunces who would undermine the principles of inclusion and diversity that America stands for. Clinton has a long and distinguished history of fighting hard for   and   Americans. As first lady, she could have taken a traditional ornamental and passive role, but she chose a path as an activist. She has been an advocate of national health care since 1993, despite fierce opposition from the   industry. We wouldn’t have the Affordable Care Act  —   which has brought coverage to millions  —   if not for her early efforts.  I especially appreciate Clinton’s unflinching support of President Obama’s policies, which have lifted many Americans both economically and socially, despite the battered economy that he inherited. Continuing the direction of those policies, including reforming a bail system that targets the poor, drug laws that target minorities and an education system that saddles college students with unbearable debts, must be a priority if the United States is to be the land of equal opportunity it brands itself to be. This election truly is a choice between hell and reason, and I want the best,   candidate to ensure that the United States lands on the right side of that battle. In Clinton we have a proven warrior who has both the commitment and record of accomplishment to lead the fight.    Read more about this topic:   Sander M.

"," Hillary Clinton got what she needed in New York, a solid victory that stopped Bernie Sanders’s   winning streak. But any cause for celebration among her supporters probably will be tempered by the reality that her unexpectedly difficult nomination battle has taken a significant toll on her candidacy. By the end of next week’s contests in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, her lead in pledged delegates in all likelihood will be insurmountable. For Sanders, there seemingly will be no path to the nomination other than the unlikely strategy of trying to persuade superdelegates to go against the will of Democratic voters.  By the beginning of May, Clinton will be at liberty to turn her attention to the general election. At that point, turning around public perceptions will be crucial if she hopes not just to win the presidency but to be able to rally the country behind her agenda. The good news for Clinton  —   and Democrats will seize on this  —   is that, against either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz in a possible general election matchup, she looks strong. That’s especially the case against Trump, who continues to run up negative numbers unheard of for a potential   nominee. But Trump’s problems do not diminish the fact that, standing alone, Clinton looks much weaker than recent nominees.  Republicans must be gnashing their teeth over the fact that their two leading candidates are unpopular while the candidates with the   and   delegates  —   Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who suspended his campaign in March, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who hopes for a miracle at the GOP convention  —   would be far stronger against Clinton.   Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. (Ricky   Washington Post)  The damage to Clinton from her battle with Sanders is borne out in the latest NBC   Street Journal poll. The longer this race has gone on, the more she has shown vulnerabilities. The   number that caught the eyes of so many analysts shows her now in a dead heat with Sanders nationally  —   ahead of him by just two percentage points, 50 to 48 percent.  Those numbers have no influence on the    results but offer a window into both the success of Sanders in generating enthusiasm and Clinton’s inability to capitalize on all her political advantages. Since October, when her candidacy began rising again after several months of controversy about her use of a private email server, she has been on a downward slide. Her lead over the senator from Vermont has dropped from what was then a   advantage to the current two points. Meanwhile, her negative ratings have been rising and now outweigh her positives by 24 points, according to the   Street Journal poll. That makes her seen no more favorably than Cruz is. Her only salvation is that Trump’s net negative is minus 41. Sanders, meanwhile, has a net positive of nine points  —   although it’s fair to say that one reason for that is that he has received far less in the way of attacks from Republicans or scrutiny from the media than Clinton has. Clinton’s image is at or near record lows among major demographic groups. Among men, she is at minus 40. Among women, she is at minus nine. Among whites, she is at minus 39. Among white women, she is at minus 25. Among white men, she is 17 positive, 72 negative. Her favorability among whites at this point in the election cycle is worse than President Obama’s ever has been, according to Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the   Street Journal poll with Democratic pollster Peter Hart. Minority voters have been the linchpin of Clinton’s nomination strategy and were a key to her success in New York. Among African Americans nationally, the   Street Journal poll shows her with a net positive of 51 points. But that’s down 13 points from her   average and is about at her lowest ever. Among Latinos, her net positive is just two points, down from plus 21 points during the first quarter. Voters’ perceptions of her having the knowledge and experience to be president remain strongly positive and unchanged since last fall. On other measures, such as whether she is easygoing and likable, or “shares your position on issues,” or is able to bring real change to the country, or is honest and straightforward, she has seen her standing erode since last fall and even more when compared with her first presidential campaign, in 2008. “By any conventional standard, this is a candidate who’s been disqualified to be president [by the voters],” McInturff said. “Her terrible numbers for months have been masked because we have the one candidate in modern history who has worse numbers. The spectacle of Donald Trump has gotten so much attention that she’s slipped under the radar for what ought to be a real story. . . . Her numbers have gone from terrible to historic and disqualifying. ”             Caption   New York voters headed to the polls Tuesday for the Republican and Democratic presidential primaries.

","     Before the 2016 presidential primary season kicked off, I told Democratic friends that of all the people lining up from the Republican Party, Ohio Gov. John Kasich was the only one who could give Hillary Clinton a serious run for her money. Wednesday morning, Kasich perfectly demonstrated why.  In a GOP primary contest defined by racism, xenophobia and a reliance on slogans masquerading as policy, Kasich debated the issues with my editorial board colleagues with knowledge and conviction. Over the course of 90 riveting minutes, he thrust and parried on his economic plan, wages, illegal immigration, Syrian refugees, climate change and voter identification laws.  Kasich’s résumé screams of someone acquainted with the ancient art of governing. First elected governor of the Buckeye State in 2010, he is now in his second term. He served in the House of Representatives from 1983 until 2001. From 1995 until 2001, Kasich was the House budget committee chairman. And all of these experiences inform his inclination to work with others to solve a problem.  That’s not to say that I agree with everything he had to say. But the expectations bar for presidential candidates has been set so low that a candidate for the Oval Office who answers questions in complete, thoughtful sentences might as well be a unicorn.     Republican presidential candidate John Kasich talks to The Washington Post about the race to win delegates, Donald Trump and race relations in the U. S. (The Washington Post)   A Kasich vs. Clinton   would be one for the ages. Two distinct visions of the country from opposite ends of the political spectrum articulated by two smart and passionate candidates. A Kasich general election candidacy would signal a GOP getting serious about what it stands for, about how it would govern this country, about winning. Instead the   for the Republican nomination is Donald Trump, a   politician whose presidential candidacy is an affront to everything we are and stand for as a country.  The transcript of our meeting with Kasich will be released later Wednesday. You will be able to read and hear for yourself what a   running to be leader of the free world sounds like. That Kasich cannot gain any traction is a pity for his party  —   and a boon for Clinton.  Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj"

","     HARTFORD, Conn.  —   Hillary Clinton accused gunmakers and the gun lobby on Thursday of using their money and power to coerce members of Congress to do their bidding, as she promised to work for new   measures if elected president. ”We need a national movement,” Clinton said at a community meeting in a YMCA here, drawing applause. ”The gun lobby is the most powerful lobby in Washington,” more so than Wall Street, big Pharma and more, she said, adding, ”They have figured out how to really intimidate elected officials at all levels, who basically stop thinking about this problem because they are too scared of the NRA,” the National Rifle Association. Clinton cited the massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren four years ago as only one example of a gun culture gone too far. She tied some gun violence to difficulty getting mental health treatment for some who need it, and said   activists are too often targeted for online harassment. ”There has been a concerted effort to undermine the   experiences of people who speak out,” Clinton said. ”Blame the victim, blame the victim’s mother  blame the victim’s family, blame the victim’s neighborhood,” she said. ”Find somebody to blame instead of saying  —   you know what, we’ve just got too many guns in this country.” She repeatedly promised to try to build on the Brady bill, which was passed during her husband’s administration, and said the gun lobby has effectively blocked most   efforts since then. She said   gun control can be achieved without infringing on the Second Amendment and with the support of gun owners. ”I am not here to make promises I can’t keep,” she said. ”I’m looking for ways we can save lives. It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun.”      Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says Americans cannot become ”indifferent” to daily gun violence in the United States, and that lasting solutions are needed to address the problem. (Reuters)   Clinton was introduced by Erica Smegielski, whose mother, Dawn Hochsprung, was the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School and was killed along with 20 children and five other staff members at the Newtown, Conn. school by a gunman in 2012. Clinton’s voice broke as she recounted how a participant in a panel discussion at the YMCA, Nelba   had given her the children’s book that she and her    daughter, Ana Grace, had been reading the night before she was killed at Sandy Hook. It was one of the country’s worst mass shootings. An emotional Clinton said   asked her to read the book to her own granddaughter, Charlotte. She was also visibly moved by the story told by an audience member, a local pastor, of beseeching God to save his son, fatally shot at 20 by another   . ”Let the congregation say, Amen,” Clinton said when he finished. She mentioned her Democratic presidential primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, only in passing. She noted that he had voted in favor of a law giving gunmakers unusual protection from lawsuits, while she had opposed it as a U. S. senator representing New York. She pledged to try to overturn that protection."

","       Yes, I know. The Democratic primary race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is still going on. But, the delegate math is very, very close to determinative  —   in her favor.     While the race will go on  —   maybe even until June 7 when California closes out the process  —   it’s worth taking a first cut at the men and women that Clinton will consider to be her vice presidential nominee.  This is a conversation that has been going on behind the scenes  —   in Washington and elsewhere  —   for the better part of the last two years (and truthfully, longer). But now, with Clinton’s nomination all but assured, the ”who will she pick” conversation will break more into the public light. So, without further ado, the initial Fix rankings of Clinton’s likely picks. (And make sure to read how the Republican candidates are already thinking about veep picks too.)    To the line! 5. Amy Klobuchar: We know from Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, that Clinton will have a woman in her final vice presidential mix. The only question is who. Klobuchar fills that slot for now as an    star in the party who represents a state  —   Minnesota  —   where Democrats would be favored to hold a seat in the Senate. But this could be Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( . H.) or former Homeland Security secretary and Arizona governor Janet Napolitano  —   or a woman we are not even thinking about right now. 4. Tom Perez: The Labor secretary checks two boxes for Clinton (and, yes, some of vice presidential picking is  ): He’s well regarded in liberal circles, and he’s Hispanic. Also, he’s not named ”Elizabeth Warren” or ”Bernie Sanders”  —   neither of whom Clinton wants to pick.  The problem for Perez? This Politico report gets at it: ”Aside from the wonkiest of Washington circles and the most progressive corners of the left, no one’s heard of Tom Perez. He isn’t young or handsome. He has zero foreign policy experience. The highest office he’s been elected to is a suburban county council.” Yup. That.    Thomas ”Tom” Perez speaks during the announcement of his nomination for labor secretary in the East Room of the White House on March 18, 2013. (Andrew  )  3. Tim Kaine: The Virginia senator was among the first  —   if not the first  —   major elected official to endorse Clinton’s presidential campaign. (He said he was for her in May 2014.)  That’s Kaine’s MO; he endorsed  . Barack Obama in February 2007. Kaine’s profile  —   Christian missionary, fluent Spanish speaker, governor and now senator of a swing state  —   is outstanding. The one issue for Kaine: He’s a white male with ”senator” before his name right now.    Sen. Sherrod Brown ( ) will continue a   fight into 2014. (Jeffrey   Washington Post)   2. Sherrod Brown: Stylistically, Brown, who has been a member of Congress, Ohio secretary of state and now a U. S. senator, is Clinton’s opposite. Gruff to her polished. Populist to her, um, not populist. Blue collar to her white collar. And he’s from Ohio  —   one of the swingiest states in the country. Brown could also be  —   and would likely relish  —   the traditional vice presidential role as an attack dog against the Republican ticket. One downside for Brown: Picking him and winning puts a very competitive Senate seat in play at a time when Democrats are trying to win back control of the chamber.    From one VP to another? Vice President Biden and   Antonio Mayor Julian Castro chat in Iowa in 2013. Castro is the one name almost always mentioned as Clinton’s potential vice presidential pick. (Steve   Images)  1. Julian Castro: Castro, on paper, is the person Clinton would like to pick. Why? He is a telegenic    Latino from Texas. He complements her in virtually every way, demographically speaking. My working belief has long been that Castro was picked to be secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration at least in part so he would have the experience and profile to be part of a national ticket. Castro will absolutely be vetted; whether he passes that vet remains to be seen.

211670,The village that helped Hillary Clinton move past Bill’s infidelity,Washington Post,Lisa Bonos,F,2016-05-02,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160503005257/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2016/05/02/the-village-that-helped-hillary-clinton-move-past-bills-infidelity/
","     We know that Hillary Clinton believes it takes a village to raise a child. As my colleague Carlos Lozada has pointed out, 20 years since “It Takes a Village” was published in 1996, the presidential candidate still draws on that village philosophy on the campaign trail. While revisiting Clinton’s 2004 memoir “Living History” recently, I noticed that she also relied on a village of friends and political and spiritual leaders to move past her husband’s infidelity in the 1990s. Her persona as a pragmatist extends not only on health care and the economy, it seems, but also her personal relationships. And what a village it was! First, her close confidantes Diane Blair (a friend of the Clintons since the 1970s) and Betsy Ebeling (a childhood friend) came to visit the White House. “It made me feel better to have friends around who had known me forever,” Clinton writes of their visit in September 1998, “who had seen me pregnant and sick and happy and sad and could understand what I was going through now. ” While Blair and Ebeling were visiting, Stevie Wonder stopped by the White House to play a song he had written specifically for the first lady. “He hadn’t finished all the words,” Clinton writes, “but the song was about the power of forgiveness, with the refrain, ‘You don’t have to walk on water.   …     ’ ” She adds that: “This was one of the kindest gestures anyone made during this incredibly difficult period. ” Katharine Graham, The Washington Post publisher “who had had her own experience with the agony of infidelity,” Clinton notes, “made a point of inviting me to lunch. ” Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue magazine, called the first lady to propose an article and photo shoot. “It was gutsy of her to offer and counterintuitive for me to accept,” Clinton writes. “In fact, the experience did wonders for my spirits. I wore a glorious burgundy velvet Oscar de la Renta creation for the cover shoot. For a day, I escaped into a world of makeup artists and haute couture. The Annie Leibovitz photographs were great, giving me the chance to look good when I had been feeling so low. ” Nelson Mandela, who at the time was president of South Africa, visited the White House after a session of the U. N. General Assembly. Clinton describes how, at a reception for African American religious leaders, Mandela praised the relationship Bill Clinton formed with South Africa and the rest of the continent. When Mandela said publicly that “We have often said that our morality does not allow us to desert our friends”  —   and addressed Bill directly by saying “We are thinking of you in this difficult and uncertain time in your life”  —   Hillary viewed this as a “plea to Americans” to stop the effort to impeach the president. “If Mandela could forgive,” Clinton writes, “I would try. But it was hard, even with the help of many friends and role models. ” The Dalai Lama also came for a visit. He presented the first lady with a white prayer scarf and told her that he thought of her often. “He encouraged me to be strong and not give in to bitterness and anger in the face of pain and injustice,” Clinton writes. Hillary Clinton said that Democratic members of Congress called to see what they could do. One congressman told her, “Hillary, if you were my sister, I’d punch Bill Clinton right in the nose!” And some Republicans let her know that they disagreed with their party’s push to impeach the president. In addition to that village of friends and supporters, the first lady writes of regaining her footing through campaigning for, among others, Sen. Barbara Boxer in California, Patty Murray in Washington and Rep. Chuck Schumer’s Senate campaign in New York. Shortly after the 1998 election, Rep. Charlie Rangel called the first lady and urged her to run for Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s seat in the U. S. Senate. At first she thought the idea was “absurd,” she writes, before eventually changing her mind. One of the benefits of pondering a run for the Senate, Clinton writes, was that she and Bill were talking about things other than their relationship. “The tables were now turned,” she writes, “as he played for me the role I had always played for him. ” That sentence has new relevance now, as we could see the Clintons back in the White House, spousal roles once again reversed.

211702,Hillary Clinton is walking into Donald Trump’s trap,Washington Post,Danielle Allen,F,2016-05-04,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160505002228/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clinton-is-walking-into-donald-trumps-trap/2016/05/04/1cbe2722-120a-11e6-81b4-581a5c4c42df_story.html
","   The writer is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post.   Donald Trump has set a big, fat trap for Hillary Clinton, and so far she has stepped right into it. He turned his attacks against women against her. She is, he argued, playing the “woman card. ” And Clinton anted up, offering her supporters the chance to buy a “woman card. ” From now until Nov. 8, Trump will surely continue to insult women. If Clinton routinely responds to those attacks, Trump will turn her into the “women’s candidate,” and she will lose. She is already perilously close to being that candidate. Let’s be honest. Polling shows that Trump has a problem with women, but it also shows that Clinton has a problem with men. Thanks to Bernie Sanders’s pushing and prodding over the course of the primary, Clinton’s vision has expanded, but we all know its core: She is a   warrior for women and children. Consider her slogan, “Fighting for us. ” For many men, this slogan would have to be experienced as emasculating. A woman fighting for them? Rightly or wrongly, the slogan rubs the wrong way in relation to traditional notions of masculinity. Her slogan itself reveals a limited conception of who she seeks to represent. This is a potentially fatal flaw in Clinton’s campaign. The more that Clinton takes Trump’s bait around the issue of his denigration of women, the more powerfully this flaw in her own campaign will show itself.  [This brutal new ad shows the shredding machine that awaits Trump]       Clinton needs to fix this problem, and fast. And she needs to avoid taking Trump’s bait. There are important lessons to be learned from the many Republican candidates who rose to the bait and were decimated by Trump’s rhetoric. His monikers for them consistently had two effects: They pushed his foes off message and also forced them to fight on turf that Trump chose for them. Trump wants to rumble with Clinton in a battle of the sexes because he believes that it will be losing terrain for her. He is right that this ground favors him. After all, this is the terrain on which the #NeverTrump campaigners largely fought him, and they have failed. How then ought Clinton to respond?  First, she should let her surrogates do the work of responding to issues raised by Trump that would pull her off her core message. She should let her surrogates do the work of replacing his labels with her own. Personally, she should meet his insults with a cheery silence, or a lighthearted deflectionary joke. She needs to become Teflon  —   not to engage.  [The dangerous nihilism of Trump voters]  Second, each week, Clinton needs a message powerful enough to rival the rhetorical force of Trump’s own messages. How many of us can say what Ted Cruz’s or John Kasich’s messages have been in the past eight weeks? But we can all say what Trump’s have been. “The Republican primary process is rigged. ” “The person who gets the most votes should get the nomination,” and so on. Clinton needs weekly messages that meet the moment and drive the conversation. Third, and most important, Clinton needs to force Trump to fight on the ground he has claimed as his own. No one has yet forced him to do that. She needs to challenge him on the terrain he is seeking to defend. Rather than simply fighting for women and children, Clinton needs to fight Trump for the votes of men. His slogan is, “Make America Great Again. ” Hers should be, “Make America Fair Again. ”             Caption   From Jon Stewart to Cher, some said they’d move to Canada, but some preferred another planet.  Jon Stewart  After the Emmy Awards in September, Stewart was asked whether he’d consider returning to ”The Daily Show” if Donald Trump is elected president in 2016. “I would consider getting in a rocket and going to another planet because clearly this planet has gone bonkers,” he said.

211715,3 reasons Donald Trump could beat Hillary Clinton and win the presidency,Washington Post,Philip Wallach,M,2016-05-04,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160505002228/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/04/3-reasons-donald-trump-can-win-against-hillary-clinton/
","     The marquee matchup is now in view: Clinton vs. Trump. There are still some wrinkles to be worked out  —   an independent (or  ) challenger might shake things up, and Trump still has some work to do to secure the Republican nomination  —   but it’s looking like the Empire State will produce its first president since FDR. Most people assume Clinton is the prohibitive favorite in this contest, and that’s a fair extrapolation of current polling that shows Trump would start the race as a historically unpopular candidate. But nobody should be handing Clinton the keys to her old house just yet. Clinton over Trump is not a foregone conclusion  —   not in 2016, the year of such mistaken assumptions about the nature of American politics. A generic sense that Trump has a puncher’s chance is now widespread. Usually, it involves a new development in Clinton’s legal troubles or a jarring terrorist attack that could change everything, and The Donald has proved sufficiently surprising by now that we are obliged to offer a heartfelt, “Who knows?” But there are three particular factors making Trump a bigger threat to Clinton than is generally acknowledged. 1. Concerns about bigotry aren’t the   you might think Trump’s long history of outrageous statements combined with America’s current demographics convince many people he is dead on arrival. Should we assume that Trump will fare historically poorly among minorities, given his reputation for what many have labeled bigotry? Maybe. But then again maybe the notion that “everyone’s a little bit racist” is more widespread than politicians (and respectable commentators) often admit. People care about bigotry most if it translates into harmful acts. There are some allegations of that: Trump’s real estate company allegedly committed some serious acts of discrimination back in the 1970s, and voters will hear a lot more about that before November. But the evidence of Trump’s racism is mostly a record of careless remarks. Trump will surely make plenty of heartfelt declarations that there is no hatred in his heart, and then wave off his past insensitivities by saying, “Well, I’ve said a lot of things. ” And so he has. That will be enough for many people  —   probably more than you think. Trump also has an extremely low bar to clear to beat recent Republican performance with minority voters. In 2012, Barack Obama won a staggering 93 percent of African American votes, 71 percent of Hispanic votes and 73 percent of Asian American votes. Whatever one can say about Trump, he presents a radically different kind of choice from Mitt Romney. Can he really do much worse? More fundamentally, Trump’s chosen idiom is    xenophobia, not racism. The “us” part invites “regular” Americans to feel themselves as a people, in large part by identifying and rejecting elites’ cosmopolitanism as poisonous to our national fiber. That way of thinking doesn’t have to be racial at all. Trump is groping toward a 21st century Jacksonian political program that might have surprisingly wide appeal, even if it is seasoned with some genuinely offensive ideas along the way. 2. Trump is much better at dictating the terms of engagement That brings us to the second factor working in Trump’s favor: He has proved to be a brilliant manipulator of the terms of engagement. In terms of style and substance (or lack thereof) Trump made the Republican field talk about what he wanted to talk about and discuss the world in a more Trumpian way. In contrast, in her 2008 and 2016 primary campaigns, Hillary Clinton allowed her opponents to set the terms of debate to a striking extent. In 2008, that led to her primary defeat and in 2016 to a surprisingly hard road to primary victory. Trump’s strength and Clinton’s weakness on this front make it hard to be confident that Democrats will succeed at setting the agenda in 2016. 3. Clinton will be forced to defend the status quo That means Democrats should not be overly confident that they make the election a referendum on Trump, the man. Surely if they could succeed at doing so, Clinton would win in a landslide.    Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called rival Hillary Clinton the ”worst secretary of state in the history of our country” during a visit to the U. S.  border town of Laredo, Tex. on Thursday. (Reuters)   But Trump will be selling voters something more than his outsize personality; he will be asking for a choice between “Trump, the middle finger to the way things have been,” and “Clinton, the choice of more of the same. ” One doesn’t have to like Trump to choose the former; indeed, there will be more than a few voters who talk themselves into the idea that only someone with as many noxious qualities as Trump will be capable of upsetting the necessary apple carts. Clinton’s sales pitch is that she has a strong and steady record as first lady, senator and secretary of state who has learned how to work the system. That past as a consummate insider leaves her uniquely disadvantaged to defend against Trump’s   attacks. Clinton and future opponents of 21st century Jacksonian politics  —   Trumpian or not  —   need to find ways of offering their own broadly resonant version of “us. ” Affirming the status quo isn’t a viable way of doing that today, and therein lies Clinton’s vulnerability. So is Trump the favorite? None of that makes Trump the favorite to win in November. Although Trump’s qualifications and temperament have suffered glancing blows in the Republican primary, they will be relentlessly pummeled in the general election campaign  —   where his base is a much smaller piece of the pie. That will badly hurt him with Americans who have a minimal sense of   conservatism and a strong aversion to   risks. But Trump has managed to shake the foundations of American politics like no candidate before. Whether that was enabled by genius or luck (in politics, they are often difficult to disentangle) we should not underestimate him.

211736,Hillary Clinton will soon realize Donald Trump is very hard to run against,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-05-05,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160506003925/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/05/hillary-clinton-will-soon-realize-donald-trump-is-very-hard-to-run-against/
","     The prevailing wisdom in political circles following Donald Trump’s emergence as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is that he has very little chance of beating Hillary Clinton in the fall election. That she and her team of experienced operatives will carve Trump up like a Thanksgiving turkey, using his many controversial remarks to build a case that he is fundamentally unfit for the office he is seeking. That her political experience will turn him into a blubbering fool, both on the campaign trail and on the debate stage. Might happen. Could happen. But Clinton would do well to study the 16 Republican candidates who held that same belief and watched as Trump systematically destroyed them on his march to the nomination. If we learned anything about Trump during the primary campaign, it’s this: He’s very, very difficult to run against. The best way to explain Trump is through pickup basketball. (Pickup hoops is the best way to explain lots and lots of things in life. I have long maintained that I can tell what kind of person someone is in their life by playing two games of pickup basketball with them.)  In any pickup game, there are usually one or two excellent players  —   guys who played at some level in college who know the game, know how to get their shots and just make it look easy. Those guys aren’t easy to guard  —   they’re athletic and good after all  —   but, if you play against them enough, you can develop a strategy on how best to slow them down. Crowd them. Make them drive. Deny them the ball. Make them work on defense. Whatever. There is a game plan that can be built against them, because while they are good, they are predictably good  —   they usually do the same good stuff in roughly the same way over and over. Then there is the one guy who plays super unorthodox. It’s usually someone who is a good athlete but has never played organized hoops in his life. He jumps off his right foot to shoot a   layup. He takes shots from all sorts of weird angles that go in. He passes when he should shoot. He shoots when he should pass. That guy, weirdly, is harder to   for than the predictably excellent guy, because you have no idea what he’s going to do next. He might pull up from 30 feet and shoot. He might try some weird    layup move. And somehow it works for him in a way it wouldn’t for someone who spent 15 years playing organized basketball. He breaks rules he doesn’t even know exist, even as you are trying to defend him within those rules. That’s Trump as a candidate. He touts his own unpredictability as an asset, and in the context of a campaign it absolutely is. The likes of Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz could never develop a consistent plan of attack against Trump because he was, day in and day out, not only doing and saying things no ”normal” candidate would but also changing up what he said and how he said it constantly. Bush always seemed somewhere between bemused and alarmed at Trump during the campaign. Why? Because Bush is the classic example of a pol who wants to know the rules of the game, commit them to memory and then play as hard as he can by them to win. He has no idea what to do with a guy who laughs at the rules and is willing to do whatever it takes to win. Low energy! That face! Ban Muslims (temporarily)! Build a wall! Make Mexico pay for it! Renegotiate our trade deals! All of them! Lyin’ Ted! Little Marco! Hand size! The best words! Uncaptured war heroes! Megyn Kelly! Rafael Cruz as JFK assassin accomplice! New Jersey Muslims cheering! Using his massive social media presence, his command of cable television and his willingness to say and do almost anything, Trump functions as a sort of political machine gun. He fires out so many attacks in so many different directions on any given day that to respond to all of them would take up all of Clinton’s time (if it could be done at all). Trump dominates news cycle after news cycle because no one  —   at least no one so far  —   can match his productivity in churning out potential negative narratives or effectively push back on them all simultaneously. That’s the challenge ahead for Clinton and her team. How do you decide what Trump attacks to swing at and which do you just ignore? How can you tell what might turn into a mountain and what is assuredly a molehill? What if you ignore something Trump says that finds traction somehow (Cruz is Canadian!) and by the time you are forced to address it, it’s too late and the damage is done? And how do you avoid spending all of your time playing defense against a   series of rhetorical bombs thrown your way? How can you push out a message  —   any message  —   that can break through the swarm of those Trump releases daily? To return to the basketball comparison: Trump doesn’t play the game in a way that suggests he’s had years of training in the best practices of where to run on the court and when. That leads people who ”know” the game to write him off. It’s also what makes him so dangerous to Clinton."
211764,Donald Trump’s ridiculous claim that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement,Washington Post,Michelle Ye Hee Lee,F,2016-05-06,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160507002619/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-hillary-clinton-started-the-birther-movement/
","       “You know who started the birther movement? You know who started it? Do you know who questioned his birth certificate, one of the first? Hillary Clinton. She’s the one that started it. She brought it up years before it was brought up by me. ”  —   Donald Trump, interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, May 4, 2016 Zombie claims are stubborn things. No matter how many times you debunk them, they keep rising from the dead  —   even eight years later. Trump was one of the most   birthers during President Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. Starting early last year, Trump and other Republicans blamed Clinton for starting the birther movement. Our friends at FactCheck. org thoroughly disproved this and found no link between Clinton and the birther rumors. When Trump repeated it months later, PolitiFact and our colleague David Weigel again debunked it. Not one to be deterred by facts, Trump said it yet again May 4, 2016, the day he officially became the presumptive Republican nominee for president. So we decided it’s our turn to get to the bottom of leading theories underlying this claim. Of course, the Trump campaign as usual did not respond to our request for information. The Facts The allegation that Clinton was the first, or even one of the first, to question Obama’s birth certificate is simply false. But Trump would be on safer ground if he blamed her supporters for stoking the birther rumors, which do have some Democratic roots. Let’s examine some of the main ongoing theories underlying the claim that Clinton was the “original birther. ” Strategy memo, March 2007  This memo is supposed to be a smoking gun. Mark Penn, then a Clinton campaign aide, laid out a strategy of positive and negative messages to defeat Obama. One of his suggestions was to target his “lack of American roots. ” Excerpt, from the memo obtained by the Atlantic: All of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse, multicultural and putting that in a new light.  Save it for 2050.  It also exposes a very strong weakness for him  —   his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values. He told the people of NH yesterday he has a Kansas accent because his mother was from there. His mother lived in many states as far as we can tell  —   but this is an example of the nonsense he uses to cover this up. “Let’s explicitly own ‘American’ in our programs, the speeches and the values. He doesn’t,” Penn suggested. But he added: “We are never going to say anything about his background. ” Clinton “wisely chose not to go this route,” the Atlantic reported. Staffers who criticized Obama’s “otherness” (such as sending an email asking whether Obama was secretly Muslim) were admonished, Weigel wrote. Note that the memo doesn’t mention Obama’s citizenship or question whether he was born in America. We asked Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin whether mentioning Obama’s citizenship was part of the strategy discussed in regard to this memo. “The Clinton campaign never suggested that President Obama was not born here and never planned to,” Schwerin said. Emails from Clinton supporters in 2008 In spring 2008, some of Clinton’s supporters began circulating anonymous emails questioning Obama’s citizenship. FactCheck. org and Politico cited these emails as the first time his citizenship was called into question, by a small group of “diehard” Clinton supporters during the Democratic primary as her path toward the nomination began to fade. “What it goes back to is   …     not the Clinton campaign or her staff, but her supporters, as she was losing in the, sort of, really bitter spring of 2008,” Ben Smith,   of a Politico article digging into the birther movement’s roots, said in a 2011 MSNBC interview. “Some of her passionate supporters were kind of grasping at straws for reasons he [Obama] could be ineligible for president. ” Chain emails surfaced claiming Obama was ineligible to become president because he was born in Kenya, as his mom was too young to travel by plane back to America to give birth. Others claimed Obama was refusing to release his full birth certificate because it probably contains information that he had dual Kenyan and U. S. citizenship at birth. Of course, it was just a rumor. FactCheck. org and the Hawaii Department of Health confirmed that Obama was born in Honolulu. We found no evidence that Clinton or her campaign coordinated any of these email chains questioning Obama’s citizenship. Authors of the Politico story could not find any links to Clinton or her campaign, and neither could FactCheck. org or PolitiFact. Clinton’s interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” March 2008 Some point to a “60 Minutes” interview to show that Clinton coyly suggested otherwise. But this interview has been taken out of context. The main smear in the 2008 campaign was the rumor that Obama is a Muslim, and the birther question “bubbled around the fringes of 2008,” Smith said in the MSNBC interview. Amid the    rumors, a Clinton campaign staffer circulated a photo of Obama wearing a turban. Her campaign denounced the photo but did not identify which staffer was responsible  —   saying any of the   people working on the campaign could have sent it. Steve Kroft asked Clinton about the photo and such rumors on “60 Minutes”: Kroft: “You don’t believe that Senator Obama is a Muslim?” Clinton: “Of course not. I mean, that’s  …     You know, there is no basis for that. I take him on the basis of what he says. And, you know, there isn’t any reason to doubt that. ” Kroft: “You said you’d take Senator Obama at his word that he’s not a Muslim. ” Clinton: “Right. ” Kroft: “You don’t believe that he’s  —  ” Clinton: “No. Why would I? There is nothing to base that on, as far as I know. ” Kroft: “It’s just scurrilous  —  ” Clinton: “Look, I have been the target of so many ridiculous rumors that I have a great deal of sympathy for anybody who gets, you know, smeared with the kind of rumors that go on all the time. ” While Obama’s citizenship was not mentioned here, this clip has been used to assert that Clinton tacitly endorsed birther theories by adding: “as far as I know. ” These five words would be used against her for the next seven years. We asked Schwerin whether Clinton was suggesting that the birther rumors were true, even while calling them “ridiculous,” and he said: “No. As you pointed out, she said it was a ridiculous rumor. ” The Pinocchio Test There’s no evidence to support Trump’s repeated claim that Clinton “started” the birther movement and was one of the first to question Obama’s birth certificate. He could blame the actions of Clinton’s supporters during the 2008 primary or say the rumor has some Democratic roots. But there’s no evidence that she or her campaign questioned his birth certificate or his citizenship. Further, the campaign denounced isolated instances of Clinton’s staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim. Later in the in the same CNN interview, Wolf Blitzer asked Trump about his supporters’   attacks and death threats against Julia Ioffe for her profile of Melania Trump in GQ. Trump repeatedly distanced himself from the actions of this group of supporters: “I don’t know anything about that.   …     I know nothing about it.   …     You’ll have to talk to them about it.   …     I don’t have a message to the fans. ” If Trump doesn’t believe in being held accountable for the actions of his supporters, perhaps he should consider the same standard for his political opponents. Glass houses, and all that. Four Pinocchios         (Mary  )  (About our rating scale)              Caption   And they’ll tell you why.  Lindsey O.

211823,How Donald Trump is running to the left of Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Jose A. DelReal,M,2016-05-09,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160510002811/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-is-running-to-the-left-of-hillary-clinton/2016/05/09/ebde82da-147c-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html
","  EUGENE, Ore.  —   At a campaign rally here in one of the most liberal towns in America, Donald Trump offered praise for an  unusual party: avowed democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. “Now, I’m no fan of Bernie Sanders, but he is 100 percent right,” Trump told a crowd here this weekend. “He is 100 percent right: Hillary Clinton is totally controlled by the people that put up her money. She’s totally controlled by Wall Street. ” That’s not the only area where the presumptive Republican nominee sounds like Sanders, who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination. On a series of issues, including free trade and foreign military intervention, Trump is effectively running to the left not only of his own party but also of Clinton. For weeks, Trump has openly praised Sanders, crediting the senator from Vermont for raising questions about the former secretary of state’s judgment on campaign finance, trade and foreign policy. He has also pointed to Sanders’s questioning of Clinton’s qualifications as a sign that the topic is fair game. “NAFTA has been one of the great economic disasters. Who signed it? Clinton. Clinton,” Trump said Saturday at a rally in Lynden, Wash. He was referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was actually signed by George H. W. Bush but was implemented through legislation signed by Bill Clinton.   Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks to and meets California voters during a rally at East Los Angeles College in east Los Angeles on Thursday May 5, 2016. (Melina   Washington Post)  “It has destroyed, I’ll tell you what, it’s destroyed our country as we know it,” Trump said. The line of attack poses an unusual and vexing challenge for the Democratic   who has spent months embracing increasingly liberal positions in her primary fight with Sanders. After jockeying to win over voters on the left, the Clinton campaign is now tasked with pinpointing the best way to attack Trump  —   an ideological moving target who sometimes switches positions within the space of a day  —   while also reaching out to moderates and disaffected conservatives.  [‘There’s nobody left’: Evangelicals feel abandoned by GOP in wake of Trump]  The real estate mogul has sought to develop a clear contrast with Clinton on foreign affairs and international trade, calling for an “America First” policy that simultaneously turns her experience as the nation’s chief diplomat against her while tapping into the anxieties of angry voters worried about being left behind by globalization. In recent days, he has also moved to the left on the minimum wage and tax policy, suggesting that he is willing to alter his positions to benefit the middle class. But Trump’s populist pitch may be seriously hampered, even among voters skeptical of Clinton, by his controversial statements on women, Muslims and Mexican immigrants. During an   protest in Eugene last week, many said they would remain firmly opposed to his candidacy on the basis of social issues, including his controversial calls to deport millions of illegal immigrants and to temporarily ban Muslim foreigners from entering the country. Doug Gustafson, 29, of Bellingham, Wash. is a Sanders supporter who agrees that both Sanders and Trump have ignited the passions of Americans who feel increasingly disenfranchised. But although he agrees with Trump that recent trade pacts are bad for American workers, Gustafson said the Republican’s controversial rhetoric disqualifies him from consideration for higher office.   Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton rebuffed Republican presidential   Donald Trump’s recent remarks accusing Clinton of being an ”enabler” of her husband’s affairs. (Reuters)   “I think a broken clock is right twice a day,” he said. But Gustafson added that, given her cozy ties to Wall Street, he would not be able to vote for Clinton in November, either. “I’m not going to vote for the oligarchy,” he said.  [The Trump effect: Some Republicans fear no seat is safe]  Not every Sanders supporter is “Bernie or Bust,” however. “She’s not an infallible candidate or human being, but she’ll have my support in the general,” said Andy Brocco, 44, who lives in Eugene and is supporting Sanders. Brianna Soumokil, 19, called herself a “big Bernie supporter” but said that she would vote for Clinton in the general election “just to ensure Trump doesn’t get it. ” She dismissed Trump’s praise of Sanders for attacking Clinton. “I would definitely not be happy voting for her. I don’t support her. I don’t believe in what she believes in,” Soumokil said. “But when it comes down to the     or fascism, I’d definitely choose Hillary. ” Sanders has also made clear he is no fan of Trump, but the two do broadly agree on some issues, at least when it comes to their critiques. Like Trump, Sanders has regularly warned about what he believes are the lopsided benefits of global trade deals, including the   Partnership, which was brokered by the Obama administration. Clinton praised the deal while she was secretary of state, but after heavy attacks from Sanders last year, she said she opposes the pact. Sanders and Trump have both blasted Clinton for her 2003 vote in favor of the Iraq War, for her ties to wealthy Wall Street donors and over her qualifications to be president. Both also now criticize her for the 2011 military intervention in Libya, although Trump was a strong supporter of it at the time.  [Milbank: Sanders and Trump are peas in a pod]  “He’s been tough on her. In fact, I’d like him to keep going because the longer he goes, the more I’m going to like it,” Trump said last month in Harrisburg, Pa. the first of many such comments. “So Bernie Sanders, not me, said she is not qualified. So now I’m going to say, ‘She’s not qualified.’ Okay?” Sanders’s aides dismiss suggestions that Trump cribbing the senator’s words will ultimately hurt Clinton. They argue that these lines of attack pale in comparison to the thick books of opposition research that Republicans will employ against her. Trump’s apparent positions of agreement with Sanders have added to his problems with Republicans, many of whom are refusing to back him as the presumptive nominee because of his caustic rhetoric and controversial policies. The mogul waves away such complaints. “Some people would say I’m not that conservative on trade,” he said this weekend in Eugene. “And I believe in free trade, which everybody likes, but we’ve been taken advantage of by globalization because we have leaders that are incompetent. They don’t know how to do deals. ” He added on ABC’s “This Week”: “Don’t forget  —   this is called the Republican Party. It’s not called the Conservative Party. ” As for Clinton, she and her campaign have gone hard after Trump since he effectively secured the GOP nomination last week, attacking him as an intolerant,    plutocrat. She has focused in particular on some of his more bellicose foreign policy remarks as perilous and unsafe. “What I’m hearing from him talk about, ‘Oh, let other countries have nuclear weapons.’ . . . We’re trying to reduce their numbers to prevent other countries from having them, and he talks about it like it’s some real estate deal,” Clinton said Friday in Oakland, Calif. “That is dangerous. It is reckless. ”  Scott Clement and Anne Gearan in Washington and Katie Zezima in Oakland, Calif. contributed to this report. "
211892,Where Democratic voters don’t like either Hillary Clinton OR Bernie Sanders,Washington Post,Philip Bump,M,2016-05-11,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160512002755/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/11/where-democratic-voters-dont-like-either-hillary-clinton-or-bernie-sanders/
","     Eight years ago, Hillary Clinton obliterated Barack Obama in the Democratic primary in West Virginia, sweeping every single county and routing the eventual nominee by 41 points. The only state in which she did better was her   home state of Arkansas. On Tuesday night, as you’ve probably heard, the script flipped. This year, Clinton lost every single county in the state, with Sanders beating her statewide by about 15 points. But that’s not the most important part of the story. The most important part of the story is that in one county    Mingo County, in the heart of coal country    Clinton came in third. Bernie Sanders won the county, of course, as he won all of the others. But in Mingo County, a guy named Paul Farrell beat Clinton, too.    Farrell is at right. (Paul Farrell   Facebook)  Farrell’s campaign wasn’t a particularly robust one. He had a Facebook page, as one does, with the image above as its header until this morning. An attorney in Huntington, Farrell’s campaign consisted mostly of giving a few interviews to the media. (In one, he admits that his candidacy ”started out as a joke. ”) And he got 8. 9 percent of the vote statewide. Part of Farrell’s success in Mingo in particular was probably due to Clinton’s poorly considered comments about putting coal miners out of work. But it was probably more than that. His success brings to mind the bizarre candidacy of Keith Judd, the prison inmate who in 2012 got 41 percent of the vote in the state’s primary against incumbent President Barack Obama. (Judd was on the ballot on Tuesday, too; he only got 1. 8 percent of the vote, a little more than Martin O’Malley.) It’s a reminder that for the past three cycles, West Virginians have bucked the establishment, twice against Obama and, this time, against Clinton. ”When people vote, I don’t think they’ll necessarily be voting for Paul Farrell Jr. ,” Farrell told West Virginia Public Broadcasting, ”but I think they’ll vote for the idea of what Paul Farrell Jr. represents, and that is the right of dissent.” The electorate that came out to vote in the state on Tuesday was unusual for a party primary. A large chunk of voters said they planned to back Donald Trump in November    and that’s among Democrats. A plurality of all of the primary voters, 4 in 10, thought that the next president should be less liberal than Obama. There were a lot of   independents and a whole slew of   Republicans that voted in the primary    the latter making up 10 percent of the total according to preliminary exit poll data reported by CNN. These aren’t actually Republicans, mind you, since Republicans couldn’t technically vote in the primary. They’re people who are registered as Democrats or not registered with a party who say that, at heart, they’re Republicans. As blogger Matthew Isbell pointed out on Tuesday, West Virginia was one of the states with the highest number of Democratic voters who cast a ballot for someone other than Clinton or Sanders.     On that last map, you can see a number of states where the     protest vote was particularly high: Oklahoma, North Carolina, Maryland, Louisiana and West Virginia. (The   counties in Colorado are mostly a function of small vote totals.) Since the Democratic contest has been a   race since the outset, even Iowa and New Hampshire have less density of    votes than West Virginia. About 1 out of every 8 votes in the state went for someone besides the two leaders. Mingo County is in the far southwestern of the state    in the darkest area of that map. There’s been a remarkable amount of   over the past 12 hours about What the West Virginia Results Mean for November. One thing we can say with certainty: As in 2008 and 2012, the state is not going to vote for the Democratic Party. After all, even a lot of West Virginia Democrats don’t really like it."
211893,Hillary Clinton: A woman and candidate with seriously complicated woman issues,Washington Post,Janell Ross,F,2016-05-11,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160512002755/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/11/hillary-clinton-a-woman-candidate-with-seriously-complicated-woman-issues/
","       On Monday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump assured people that he will bring up Bill Clinton, his history with women who are not his wife, and Hillary Clinton’s role as a political adviser and defender during these crises. She’s an enabler, Trump said of the Democratic presidential  . And, he’s planning to continue, Trump told CNN, in ”retribution” for Hillary Clinton ”playing the woman card.” The Fix would rehash the ”woman card” debate if it weren’t for the   fact that one does not simply get to deploy one’s gender at will for political advantage. The experiences that come with being a woman in the United States are constant, and the decision to make these issues part of one’s campaign are no more or less legitimate than a developer, such as Trump, supporting the government’s exercise of eminent domain. And, quite frankly, we might go there if so many others had not already done so very, very well.   [Play the ‘woman card’ and reap these ‘rewards’!]      Donald Trump told supporters in Spokane, Washington on Saturday, May 7 that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was an ”enabler” for what he said was her husband, President Bill Clinton’s, mistreatment of women. (Reuters)   However, there is another set of questions that do come out of Trump’s declaration. Clinton is the first woman likely to become a major party’s presidential nominee. She is a former senator, a former secretary of state, a former first lady and key political adviser to her husband. As such, she has both a record for which she must, without question, be prepared to answer and a segment of her life where the personal and the political are more than a bit difficult to parse. Love her or hate her, this is a situation that presents quite a challenge. Yet, after Trump’s pronouncement, Clinton told reporters that she plans to say nothing at all in response to Trump’s Bill   Hillary   claims. Nothing. Given that, The Fix decided to check in with two political scientists  —   both of them women  —   who study voter behavior, female candidates and gender in politics. We asked them about the likely nominees’ plans on this front. The Experts Nadia E. Brown is an associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University. She is the author of the 2014 book ”Sisters in the Statehouse: Black Woman and Legislative Decision Making.” Brown volunteered with the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) in the   to the Indiana primary. Sarah Elise Wiliarty is an associate professor of government at Wesleyan University where she teaches comparative politics courses with a focus on Western Europe and women and politics. Her book, ”The CDU and the Politics of Gender in Germany: Bringing Women to the Party,” was published in 2010. Wiliarty is not affiliated with a campaign but plans to vote for Clinton. The Questions THE FIX:  We often talk about Hillary Clinton as if she is a singular figure: A former first lady and key political adviser, senator, secretary of state and now presidential candidate. Are there any other comparable women in history? BROWN: Perhaps Eleanor Roosevelt is the closest comparable figure to Hillary Clinton in modern American political history. Roosevelt took the reins after FDR was stricken with polio and advanced progressive policies and positions  —   notably, more reformist in nature than her husband’s  —   to advocate for women’s rights and against racial discrimination. Indeed, it was Eleanor that helped curate the Black Brain Trust  —   a group of prominent African Americans who advised the president on “Negro affairs” and who helped to sell the New Deal to black constituencies  —   and who often met with this group and took their recommendation back to the president when FDR refused to meet with them. Eleanor was a public figure who wrote a daily newspaper column, briefed (an  ) press corps, and lectured nationally. After FDR’s death, she was appointed delegate to the United Nations. She would later represent the country on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Historians believe that Eleanor, who was initially a shy and introverted woman, became increasingly independent after discovering that FDR was having an affair with her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. Although Eleanor offered to divorce Franklin, the couple  —   with the insistence of his mother, Sara  —   opted to remain married due to the social stigma of divorce, which may have devastated FDR’s early political career. Both Hillary and Eleanor devoted their time to social and political causes and their own identities as political figures. Perhaps both women saw their marriages as a way to promote their own political agendas once their husbands’ extramarital affairs were discovered. Unlike Hillary, questions surround Eleanor’s romantic life as she was openly affectionate with other women (namely, Lorena Hickok) and men. Whereas less is speculated about Hillary Clinton’s personal life, both women have shown tremendous independence outside of their marriage. WILIARTY: Actually, being elected to a political office formerly occupied by their husbands is an extremely common way for women to come to power. Frequently this happens after the husband’s death. There’s even a name for it: widow’s succession. German female politicians sometimes say, “Women enter the Bundestag over the dead bodies of the men. ” In the United States, as of 2013, eight senators and 39 congresswomen had entered office this way, including Jean Carnahan, Margaret Chase Smith, Mary Bono and Doris Matsui. Some women served only briefly following a widow’s succession, but others served several terms. Historically, women have been enormously more likely than men to gain office either through appointment or special election, often following the death of the former occupant. Presumably, women have “specialized” in this form of access because of greater difficulty with gaining office through regular general elections. From a   perspective, having family ties of some sort to a former leader is actually very common for both men and women. In Asia and Latin America, family ties have been a dominant route to executive office for women. If we look around the world, nearly all women in the office of president, that is an executive office directly elected by voters, have family ties to a former president in their country.   examples include Isabel Peron of Argentina, Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua, Cristina Fernandez (Argentina) Indira Gandhi (India) Benazir Bhutto (Pakistan) Gloria   (Philippines).    Bill and Hillary Clinton, and George W. Bush’s daughters, Jenna and Barbara, wave at President Obama’s first inauguration. (Rick  )  THE FIX: Do you anticipate that Trump will continue to raise his claim that Bill Clinton is a sexist and Hillary Clinton an enabler?  BROWN: Trump will continue to use misogynist language to bait Hillary Clinton into addressing Bill Clinton’s infidelities. We have seen Trump successfully brandish derogatory monikers against his political foes (i. e. Lyin’ Ted Cruz, Little Marco,   Jeb Bush). Connecting Hillary to Bill’s dalliances as an enabler  —   or, worse yet  —   as a woman that could not satisfy her husband  —   “What makes her think that she can satisfy America?” [Ed. note: This was a tweet that Trump’s Twitter account briefly retweeted last year, before his campaign began.] This tweet forcefully illustrates that Trump believes that Bill’s philandering is a key point of attack against Hillary. WILIARTY: I think Trump will raise any issue that he thinks will be effective criticism of Hillary or Bill Clinton. I would expect Hillary Clinton to do the same. We are probably looking at an extremely negative campaign season. THE FIX: How potent do you think the ”enabler” claim might be as a political tool? BROWN: This is a particularly potent claim against Hillary. According to a recent   International Poll, less than 20 percent of Americans sampled said that they did not think that America was ready for a woman president. Indeed, Gallup polling data has shown that Americans are increasing likely to support a woman candidate, particularly if a voter’s political party nominated a qualified woman. These numbers indicate that Americans may not be opposed to electing a woman president; it is the candidate herself that matters most. Therefore, Trump does not necessarily have to play the gender card against Hillary but rather showcase why she, in particular, is the wrong woman for the job. This nuanced argument is an individual attack against Hillary  —   not women candidates. As such, Trump may be able to sidestep overt claims of misogyny and sexism. However, if Trump’s past rhetoric is any indication of what is in store for the general election, it is highly probable that he will make direct misogynist remarks against Hillary Clinton. WILIARTY: I don’t think this particular accusation  —   that Bill Clinton is a sexist and Hillary Clinton is an enabler  —   will likely stick or be terribly effective, even if Trump tries it. Anyone who is married knows marriage is complicated, and anyone who follows politics knows that the Clintons have a political marriage, which is likely even more complicated. Hillary’s decision to stay with Bill after the many accusations of marital infidelity was seen as controversial. Some voters wanted her to leave what they regarded as an abusive relationship. Some voters were happy to see her “stand by her man.” I suspect for many voters Bill Clinton’s possible infidelities are water under the bridge. Having an affair is not really the same as sexist behavior. Bill Clinton has a pattern of illicit sexual relationships, but he is not the candidate this time around. It is possible that Hillary Clinton will be less likely to call Donald Trump a sexist if she thinks it will highlight this form of attack. THE FIX: Is there anything we already know about voter behavior that is particularly relevant in the face of this issue? BROWN: Hillary Clinton has had difficulty in mobilizing and energizing young women voters in her primary against Bernie Sanders. If she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee and Trump makes blatant sexist comments against Hillary, I anticipate that young women voters will support Hillary. Voters are primed and mobilized when they feel that the other side is attacking their core values and way of life. This motivation may drive young women voters to the polls for Hillary. Furthermore, research has shown that undecided male voters are more likely to be mobilized through the use of negative campaign ads. Potential Trump voters are primed by these attack ads. In essence, Trump’s   persona and his statements that his opponents are too feminine  —   i. e. Little Marco, Jeb Bush needing his mother to campaign for him, Hillary is too soft on ISIS [another name for the Islamic State]  —   plays into the narrative that hetero, white,   to   men need to rightfully reclaim their position as head of American society. Trump understands that his key voting demographic has [responded] and will respond to these messages  —   as presented through negative campaigning against his opponents  —   and vote for Trump in the primaries and general election. WILIARTY: I think it’s unpredictable how voters will respond.    Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. (Justin     Pressphoto Agency)  THE FIX:  Given this, what can and should Clinton do if and when Trump raises the sexist and   charge?  BROWN: Engaging Trump has proved to be unsuccessful for his former Republican primary competitors. Hillary should stay above the fray by addressing her qualifications, policy priorities and big ideas for fixing America’s problems. In doing so, she should repeatedly underscore the importance of women’s rights and gender equality (being sure to pay attention to intersectional issues, such as class, race, sexual orientation and other salient political identities  —   noting that all women do not face the same issues and experience the world differently). Responding directly to Trump’s sexist comments     charge will do little to persuade Trump supporters that they should vote for her. Instead, Hillary needs to win over independents, Bernie supporters, progressives, millennials, and disaffected liberals. Hillary should spend her energy on trying to recreate Obama’s big tent and get these voters to turnout for her in November. WILARTY: If I were Hillary Clinton’s adviser on this topic, which thank goodness I am not, I would advise her to ignore it or perhaps to say that outsiders cannot understand the internal workings of a marriage. That message will resonate with many voters. Some people may feel sorry for Hillary. Some may feel sorry for the women Bill Clinton possibly had affairs with. I doubt this particular issue will be decisive in many voters’ minds, so the best thing Hillary Clinton can do is ignore it. THE FIX: What about if Trump or his allies allege that Bill Clinton’s sins went beyond infidelity? (Rand Paul has accused the former president of being a ”sexual predator,” for instance.) WILIARTY: First, I think it’s important for [Hillary] Clinton to make clear that she thinks it’s important to take sexual assault seriously. She has already said this, but she will need to keep reiterating that point. She has a   record of being a leading voice on women’s rights, and I don’t think this issue is going to damage that record seriously. She is the candidate here, not Bill. Second, audience matters a great deal. Trump supporters will believe him and his attacks on Bill and will probably also believe that Hillary acted as an “enabler” to silence women who accused Bill of sexual assault. But they were not going to vote for Hillary anyway. Established supporters of HRC will believe her. It’s true that she has struggled to win support from younger female voters, but I don’t see this issue as the main reason for that. Younger voters, including many of the students at Wesleyan, are very taken with Sanders’s rhetoric and his ideas about   changes to the political and economic establishments in this country. It remains to be seen what will happen once we have two definitive candidates. THE FIX: Is there anything else that might  important for readers to know or understand about this issue? BROWN: Donald Trump’s attacks on Hillary Clinton are more of an attempt to rally male voters. He is speaking to men  —   particularly white,   to   men  —   who feel as if their power and prestige are unfairly being diminished in this age of political correctness and changing American social norms. In an era where the vast majority of Republican candidates are trying to court women voters, Trump is turning his attention to the other side of the gender gap  —   men voters who are more likely to vote Republican (since the 1980s) than women. Seventy percent of women say that they will not vote for Trump and that they find his rhetoric toward women to be distasteful. It is unlikely that Trump will win over more women in the general election; thus, his strategy will be to solicit male voters. Hillary Clinton’s use of the ”women card”  —   an actual card that she used as a prop in a weekend fundraiser  —   speaks well to women and an entirely different demographic than to who Trump is seeking to mobilize this election. The two candidates are using gender as a tactic to draw divergent supporters. WILARTY: I think the notion of a “first family” will be more important than Bill’s potential infidelities. Or perhaps that the infidelities will feed into a larger understanding of what the “first family” will look like after the election is over. Regardless of which candidate wins (assuming it turns out to be Trump vs. Clinton) the symbolic representation of the “first family” is going to look quite novel to voters and probably some will struggle with the new possible images that either candidate presents.

","     Let’s stipulate this: Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic presidential nominee. But Clinton’s path to that nomination has been far rockier than she or her supporters expected it to be when Bernie Sanders emerged as her main competition. (Don’t believe the Clinton spin that they always knew that the    democratic socialist from Vermont was going to pose a major threat to her candidacy.) Some of that rockiness has to do with Sanders, who has emerged as a sort of cause celebre to the liberal left. Even in Sanders’s surprising rise, however, are the seeds of Clinton’s broader problem in the race: People struggle to relate to her. She often comes across as inauthentic or lacking a basic core of beliefs. The idea of finding out who the ”real” Hillary Clinton is seems  . Even many people who believe she should  be president acknowledge, usually privately, that she is fundamentally unknowable. Jon Stewart, the comedian turned   talk show host, summed up Clinton’s candidate problems very well in a recent podcast interview with Democratic strategist David Axelrod. Here’s the key bit:   Jon Stewart goes off on Hillary Clinton (on The Axe Files): ”A bright woman without the courage of her convictions.” pic. twitter.   —   Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) May 12, 2016  That’s a brutal assessment. But it’s not wrong. Take a look at Magic Johnson, late night host:  Awkward, right? As Stewart said, Magic’s inability to pull off the   host gig wasn’t a judgment against his broader persona  —   the guy is remarkably successful on and off the court  —   but simply reflected the fact that not everyone is good at everything. Magic didn’t have a feel for what it took to host a   show. And there was no amount of coaching or studying that could make it all seem natural. That’s a very good diagnosis of Clinton the candidate, too. She is, without question, someone with long experience in public policy and public service. She has oodles of details about everything she would do if elected president. Her command of issues on a debate stage or in a media interview is without equal. And yet, when she is out on the campaign trail, the word that most often comes to mind for Clinton is ”clunky.” Or ”formulaic.” ”Guarded.” Inauthentic.” ”Rehearsed.”  You get the idea.  If connecting is the coin of the realm in politics, Clinton doesn’t have much money in her pocket. ”Hillary is . .. a bright woman without the courage of her convictions, because I don’t know what they even are,” says Stewart  —   an assessment I have heard time and again in private conversations with Democratic strategists over the last few years. While Clinton’s closest allies insist she is warm and funny in private, the candidate has never been able to translate those character traits into her public persona. People want Hillary Clinton, but all they ever get is ”Hillary Clinton.” That’s somewhat understandable, given that Clinton has not only been in the public eye for three decades but has also been the focus of Republican attacks for much of that time. Clinton fundamentally distrusts many of the actors in the political world  —   including the media  —   which makes it tough for her to show her true self. Regardless of the reasons (and how justified they may nor may not be) the Clinton that voters meet tends to be someone who comes across as overly cautious and too political  —   afraid to say what she thinks about anything for fear of alienating this or that constituency. In a political environment where a sizable chunk of voters have responded to the blunt realism of Donald Trump, that struggle to connect is a problem. Given Democrats’ clear electoral and demographic edges in the 2016 election, Clinton’s connectivity issues may not matter. But if her struggles to put away Sanders in the Democratic primary are any indication, then Stewart is really on to something."

"," You could say that it all depends on how you define “lie. ” Or, perhaps, that it’s hell to have a public record. Either way, Hillary Clinton’s vast résumé of, shall we say, inconsistencies, is the dog that caught the car and won’t let go. A viral video collection of her comments on various subjects through the years is bestirring Republican hearts.  To those who’d rather vote for a reality show host than a Clinton, the video merely confirms what they’ve believed all along. For independents and even Democrats, it’s a reminder of how often Clinton has morphed into a fresh incarnation as required by the political moment. Most of the highlights will be familiar to anyone who follows politics  —   her varying takes on Bosnia, health care, Wall Street, NAFTA  —   but the juxtaposition of these   views is more jarring than one might expect. Politicians count on Americans’ short attention spans (and memories) as much as they do their own policies   charms. This video  inartfully titled “Hillary Clinton lying for 13 minutes straight,” clarifies blurred recollections and recasts them in an order that, among other things, reminds us how long the Clintons have been around. If you’re looking for a fresh face or an   candidate, Hillary Clinton isn’t it. But then neither are Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, both of whom have been haunting the public square nearly all of their adult lives  —   one a raging radical, the other a radical rager.    During an interview with ABC News, Hillary Clinton apologized for using a private   server during her time as secretary or state. Here are past statements where the presidential hopeful neglected to take personal responsibility for the controversy. (The Washington Post)   Presumptive nominees Clinton and Trump are equally egregious in their misstatements, if in substantively different ways. Clinton is measured, poised, concentrated and studied when she revises her personal history. Trump just says whatever tiny thought penetrates his prefrontal cortex, where inhibitory functioning is obviously kaput, blurting absurdities and bromides the way pirates toss plastic beads from   ships at Mardi Gras. Lacking a policy record to defend or reverse, Trump gets to gloat and sneer at his female foe. He did reverse himself on his irrelevant position regarding the Iraq War, but the number of real estate developers whose opinions factored into the nation’s military calculation in 2003 was exactly zero. Otherwise, his   act toward women, minorities, the disabled and others is apparently acceptable to the Republican Party.  Clinton’s record is something else. The woman who would become president promises a continuation of President Obama’s policies, even though she rejected many of them in 2008. The candidate who hates NAFTA almost as much as she now despises Wall Street is captured in several clips praising NAFTA.  A review of her bizarre accounting of landing in Bosnia under sniper fire in 1996 is almost entertaining. Audacious, really. Rather than ducking and dodging across a tarmac where no welcoming committee was present, film footage reminds us that she and daughter Chelsea Clinton calmly walked from the plane, posed for photographs with students there to greet them, and shook hands with a little girl. No news here, just a rehash of history. One Web author who posted the video  —   sent to me by several readers  —   insists that it would be impossible to vote for Clinton after viewing the   montage. This may or may not be true given the alternative, but a refreshed memory does invite fresh consideration of Clinton’s character. On questions of honesty and trustworthiness, Clinton consistently polls low, including among Democrats, which partly explains Sanders’s support. His economic plan may be fantastical, but at least he’s honest!  Well, maybe. With Clinton, there’s no maybe, as the 13 minutes make clear. For whatever reason, she simply can’t seem to stick to the truth, which, at times, needs neither embellishment nor denial. Wasn’t it enough to have gone to Bosnia to conduct the nation’s   soft diplomacy?

","   Hillary Clinton is a Democratic candidate for president and a former secretary of state and U. S. senator from New York.   Jennifer lives in Loudoun County. She has three young boys. She pays $2, 500 every month for child care. That’s more than her mortgage.  This month in Northern Virginia, I met several moms and dads who told me similar stories.  In every state in the country, child care for two kids now costs more than the average rent. You read that right  —   child care costs more than housing. And in many states, it’s even more expensive than college tuition.  For parents who need to work, this is more than an inconvenience. It’s a crisis.  And it’s particularly urgent in the District, which is now the priciest   market in America.  A recent national survey found that more than   of mothers and half of fathers say they’ve had to pass up work opportunities, switch jobs or even quit working because there was no other way to pay for child care. But working fewer hours or dropping out of the workforce altogether can have   consequences for families’ incomes.  A lack of quality child care can be dangerous, too. In 2014, nine children in Virginia died in unlicensed   centers. Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) recently signed a bill to improve statewide safety standards, but without more federal funding, there’s only so much that states can do.  We’ve got to make investing in child care a national priority, especially for young parents, many of whom are trying to pay off student loans. I remember how difficult it was when Chelsea was born. I was a young lawyer in Arkansas trying to start a career. Bill was working hard all the time. We did everything we could to put our daughter first, and we had all kinds of advantages that many families didn’t. Still, it was a juggling act.  Today’s families have it worse. Child care, college and housing costs have skyrocketed while incomes have barely budged. And workplace policies haven’t changed even though families have, with women earning more of the family income than ever and men doing much more to care for kids and aging parents.  Many workers don’t have paid family leave. Many women don’t even get a single paid day off to give birth. The pressures are so intense that some workers worry that taking an earned vacation day will be seen as slacking off.    Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took aim at Republican presidential   and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump’s tax plan. (Reuters)   It’s not supposed to be easy, but it shouldn’t be this hard.  As president, I would work to make quality, affordable child care available to all families. I’m committed to increasing federal investments and incentivizing states so that no family ever has to pay more than 10 percent of its income for child care. This is a big idea, and I’m determined to fight for it.  Let’s double our investment in programs I helped develop as first lady: Early Head Start and the Early Head   Care Partnership program. These programs bring an   curriculum to child care and make sure kids get the best possible start in life, no matter how much money their families have.  Let’s lighten the burden on the   of college students who are parents by providing scholarships of up to $1, 500 per year for child care. And because none of this would be possible without talented and hardworking   professionals, let’s make sure we’re paying them a decent wage, too.  In addition to affordable child care, working parents deserve the security of knowing they won’t lose income  —   or their jobs  —   for taking care of themselves or a loved one. One dad in Virginia told me that to stay home for his newborn’s early days, he had to cobble together sick days and vacation days. Many people can’t do even that.  It’s time we stopped being the only advanced economy in the world that doesn’t offer workers paid family leave. That’s why I strongly support the paid family leave proposal the D. C. Council is pursuing. We should encourage states and local communities to take action as long as Congress refuses to act.  Under my plan, working Americans would earn up to seven days of paid sick leave each year. They would be guaranteed up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave to care for a new baby or sick family member or to recover from an illness or injury. And we can fully fund this program by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share of taxes. It’s all too easy for “kitchen table issues” such as these to get overlooked in our politics. But they matter to families. They matter to kids. And they’ve been the work of my life.  So until America’s moms and dads can sleep a little easier, I’m going to keep bringing them up.

212134,Hillary Clinton says Bill won’t be picking out the White House china. He should.,Washington Post,Jill Filipovic,F,2016-05-19,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160522001117/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/05/19/hillary-clinton-says-bill-wont-be-picking-out-the-white-house-china-he-should/
","       If Hillary Clinton is elected president, she won’t be the only Clinton making gender history: Her husband, Bill, will take his place as the first “first gentleman. ” Lest voters get nervous, Hillary has pledged that Bill wouldn’t be on traditional first lady duty  —   he’d be in charge of fixing the economy, not picking out the flowers and china for state dinners. But why shouldn’t he pick the china? If one goal of a Hillary Clinton presidency is to challenge traditional gender roles, then her husband should flout them, too. The best way he could do that is by taking on the domestic issues facing women and children that are too often derided as “softer” than economic or foreign policy topics  —   and, yes, doing the stereotypically feminine work of party planning and decorating, too. A first man managing the White House household would be just as groundbreaking as a female president. The role of the first lady has always been  . Her top duty has traditionally been to serve as a hostess, tending to the homebound aspects of White House life  —   planning state dinners, decorating, selecting silverware, hosting Easter Egg Rolls and, more recently, tackling uncontroversial issues such as literacy and children’s health. A few have been rebels: Eleanor Roosevelt testified before Congress in support of migrant workers and wrote a newspaper column on issues she cared about; Rosalynn Carter led efforts to improve the mental health system and often sat in on Cabinet meetings; Nancy Reagan was one of her husband’s closest advisers; Sarah Polk served as her husband James’s unpaid assistant. But by and large, first ladies have stayed out of   policy spaces, at least in the public eye. Until first lady Hillary Clinton. Presidents’ wives “have had significant roles in varying ways, but Hillary was really different,” taking on   reform as a major policy initiative, said Karen Blumenthal, a journalist and the author of “Hillary Rodham Clinton: A Woman Living History. ” “Once it failed, she didn’t just go back to picking the silver and the menus. She becomes something of a foreign emissary, she goes to countries that Bill doesn’t go to but where it’s valuable for there to be an American presence. ”   [Should we worry about Bill Clinton’s role in a Hillary Clinton administration?]   Clinton became a vocal advocate for women’s rights overseas, against the advice of her husband’s advisers. She worked with Republican and Democratic senators to pass the State Children’s Health Insurance Program and pushed her husband’s administration to fund and implement it. She kept her own office in the West Wing  —   a first for first ladies  —   and her own staff that helped on policy initiatives. And she faced enormous backlash. During Bill Clinton’s first presidential campaign, she was routinely compared to Lady Macbeth and denounced as a “rogue feminist. ” Attacked for her thriving legal career, she defended herself by saying that she “could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession”  —   and was swiftly pilloried (she published her    cookie recipe in Family Circle magazine in part to defuse the controversy). Once Bill was in office, opposition to Hillary’s role in   reform, which was quickly branded “Hillarycare,” stemmed partly from the perception that she was straying from a first lady’s proper role. By the time her husband was embroiled in a sex scandal, Hillary had scaled back her domestic policy objectives, advocating for Bill as the House impeached him and the Senate voted to keep him in office. She also campaigned, often behind the scenes, for the rights of women and children. Her approval ratings soared. Presidential spouses appear to have noticed the scorn heaped on Hillary for her nontraditional work. The last two first ladies took on important causes  —   literacy for Laura Bush, childhood obesity for Michelle Obama  —   but neither of them went overseas the way Clinton did or spearheaded major policy initiatives (although some of Obama’s child health work has been surprisingly controversial among Republicans who want   liberals to keep their hands off kids’ tater tots). “Both of them have been much more traditional,” Blumenthal said. “My sense is that they saw the way Hillary paid for that and chose not to take that approach. ” Modern first ladies have staffs that take care of most of the hosting details  —   decorations, flowers, food  —   and even the media seems more interested these days in what the East Wing is doing  . But while Obama and Bush did more   advocacy than most of their predecessors, they nevertheless remained involved in decorating for Christmas, overseeing party planning and managing renovations. After Hillary, they both walked a fine line, focusing on issues they cared about without being perceived as overstepping their bounds, and often undercutting their own successes and ambitions by emphasizing their roles as mothers and helpmeets to their husbands. “Through their publicity, and as role models for American women, first ladies helped to legitimate women’s participation in the public and political spheres long reserved for men,” wrote Lisa Burns, now a professor of media studies at Quinnipiac University, in a dissertation that would become the basis of her book on first ladies. “. . . These women were granted the latitude to perform in the political sphere, provided that they confined their interests to issues affecting women and children. When first ladies were suspected of violating these boundaries, press criticism that framed them as political interlopers helped to contain them. ” It was clear in the 1990s that many Americans were uncomfortable with a break from tradition in what is our most public of traditional female roles. The public now also seems uncomfortable with the idea of Bill Clinton, once the most powerful man in the world, doing what’s always been seen as women’s work. Articles questioning the place of Hillary’s husband in a second Clinton White House abound, taking for granted that the usual duties are beneath him: It would be an insult to have a man of such experience and intellect using his expertise to promote a lightweight issue such as children’s health, or doing something as frivolous as deciding between   plates and   ones. Even the Clintons say they’re unsure what moniker they would use: First dude? First mate? This surely isn’t because we discourage frivolity or interest in aesthetics and entertaining in men  —   if that were true, the world would lack golf courses and sports cars. It isn’t because keeping the very young alive and thriving is inherently less valuable, or figuring out how to get there less complicated, than debating the merits of this tax policy or that infrastructure project. It’s because we associate things like selecting flowers and caring for children with women  —   and so we’re okay with first ladies advocating on women’s and children’s issues, but not much else. Culturally, we have a deeply ingrained, often subconscious contempt for women and for the things women do. That’s why when something is marked “feminine,” it becomes humiliating or emasculating for a man to do it. It’s why we smirk at the idea of Bill Clinton taking over Michelle Obama’s vegetable garden. Men today do spend more time with their children, and do more around the house, than ever before. But they haven’t taken on   work at the same volume and velocity as women have taken on work outside the home. Hillary Clinton is challenging   assumptions about women, authority and power by running for president. Having a female leader for the first time in our   history would be a huge symbolic change. We need stereotypes of maleness to change, too. Having a former president lead on subjects branded as less important or on matters that our culture has usually left to women to worry about would make clear that issues don’t become “soft” as soon as they’re not primarily about the boys. Despite her clear preference for substantive policy work, Clinton also handled all the traditional first lady duties: hosting parties, overseeing White House renovations, hiring a chef, championing American historical treasures. If he really wants to challenge gender divides, Bill Clinton should take on these traditionally female obligations. He would send a powerful message: There’s no such thing as “women’s work” and “men’s work,” “women’s issues” and “hard issues. ” And the aesthetic, domestic and social labor women have long done in the White House  —   indeed, the labor they have long done in many houses, with smaller budgets and fewer flower arrangements  —   is valuable, too. Both power and marriage look very different today than they did 50 years ago. Going forward, our presidents’ marriages will look more like the Clintons’ and the Obamas’ than the Reagans’ or the Trumps’: two highly educated, ambitious people in a partnership of mutual support. Clearly, we need new model for first spouses. So maybe Bill could perform the traditional duties of a first spouse and also have his own policy portfolio that included children’s welfare and the economy alike. Removing himself from feminized work in the White House would only reinforce gender divisions and stereotypes about women’s roles, and could leave future first ladies in the same circumscribed, culturally fraught position they’re in now. If they make it to the White House, both Clintons have an opportunity to break political molds as old as America itself. Hillary’s attempts to challenge stereotypes have sometimes been imperfect, as when she wielded cookie recipes to salve American unease with powerful, ambitious women. But largely, she’s dedicated herself to improving women’s lives, and she is a living icon of what smart, determined, feminist women can achieve. She’s done her part. It’s time for Bill to do his.

","     (We may never get to see the transcript of the chat conversation going on among the Hillary Clinton team right now, but I can only assume that were it leaked, it would go something like this.) IN CHAT: Hillary, Redacted, Redacted Redacted: Team! Did you read David Brooks today explaining why Hillary is disliked? Riveting stuff. He said that it was because nobody knows “what Hillary Clinton does for fun[.]   …     when people talk about Clinton, they tend to talk of her exclusively in professional terms.   …     Clinton’s career appears, from the outside, to be all consuming.   …     Clinton’s unpopularity is akin to the unpopularity of a workaholic. Workaholism is a form of emotional  . Workaholics are so consumed by their professional activities that their feelings don’t inform their most fundamental decisions.   …     Josef Pieper wrote that leisure is not an activity, it’s an attitude of mind. It’s stepping outside strenuous effort and creating enough stillness so that it becomes possible to contemplate and enjoy things as they are. Even successful lives need these sanctuaries  —   in order to be a real person instead of just a productive one. It appears that we don’t really trust candidates who do not show us theirs. ” This struck me as interesting given that I thought Hillary wasn’t trusted not because people didn’t know about her leisure activities but because large swaths of the Internet burst into flame at a single mention of the Clinton Foundation? But this man is a columnist, and you know what they say about the American public: It listens to the opinions of columnists, and columnists are never wrong about it. Hillary: I too found it remarkable that he thought my low numbers were due to the fact that I had not shared my leisure activities with the public. I have attached a spreadsheet and PowerPoint of many leisure activities in which I take part, which I trust that many Americans (especially women) will find to be quite relatable. Warm Regards, Hillary Redacted: Hillary you don’t need to sign this  —   it’s a group chat Hillary: GOOD TO KNOW!   Redacted: Hillary I’m taking a look at your list of leisure activities to see what we can run with in here, and I’m a little curious. You say in the spreadsheet that “like millions of Americans, I can spend whole days buffering” and “sometimes to unwind I will sit in traffic for HOURS” did you just google what Americans spend most of their time doing and pretend these were your leisure activities? Hillary: definitely not I wouldn’t do that those are my real hobbies I love a good traff Redacted: Hillary that’s not Hillary: Lemonade Redacted: okay let’s get back to the spreadsheet you said “I spend eight hours a day relaxing with my eyes closed, although for a brief period within that my eyeballs move rapidly”  —   that sounds like sleeping, Hillary. Most people don’t consider that a fun hobby. Hillary: sometimes when I’m lying there in a recumbent or prone posture with eyes shut my mind pretends that my life is different and I can fly it’s like swimming but through the air that’s pretty far out though we might not want to share it Redacted: Hillary that’s a dream Hillary: no dreams are like when you envision your future the way Dr. King did and millions of little girls can, now, when they look to me Redacted: Hillary what do you do for fun Hillary: nothing not really my style of band I thought fun had a period after it Redacted: I can’t tell if you’re joking or not Other Redacted: hang on I’m going to reread the article maybe we can try another tactic Redacted 3: I hate to be the person in the chat who is always saying WOULD PEOPLE CLAIM THEY COULD NOT TRUST YOU BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW YOU SPENT YOUR LEISURE IF YOU WEREN’T A WOMAN but  —   no, I’m going to be that person. Seriously? I have no idea what Bernie does for fun. I think he lectures birds? Or makes indignant telephone calls to newspapers to ask about his subscription? I don’t think not knowing this is something most people hold against him. I don’t think people said to themselves, “That Abraham Lincoln seems okay, but does he do anything for fun?” Teddy Roosevelt hunted big game but that wasn’t what made people confident in him. The fact that President Obama plays golf makes some people so angry they want to tear holes in the Internet it doesn’t reassure them that he’s trustworthy this is just more of the nonsense double standard where Dad gets to be fun and responsible and mom has to be a   killjoy who always knows where everyone’s towels are and then everyone turns around and complains that she’s not fun and lacks hobbies this is why puns are dad jokes moms don’t even get to make puns because they’re supposed to be ironing linens or taking their   responsibilities seriously or something this is just more fruit from that particular tree, and I am sick of it. Furthermore literally any hobby you said would be held against you forever and they would make mean bobbleheads depicting you doing it.

212221,Can Bernie Sanders actually hurt Hillary Clinton on his way out?,Washington Post,Paul Waldman,M,2016-05-24,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160525000500/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/05/24/can-bernie-sanders-actually-hurt-hillary-clinton-on-his-way-out/
","     Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are now in an extended process of negotiating the terms of his surrender. But I’m beginning to wonder if Sanders understands just how few cards he has left to play. Yesterday, the DNC announced the makeup of the committee that will decide the party’s platform, with Clinton choosing six members, Sanders choosing five, and party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz choosing four. Clinton chose the kind of people you might expect, covering bases with the party’s key constituencies  —   a union leader, a prominent Latino congressman, the chief of a liberal think tank  —   while Sanders picked mostly activists who could be considered outsiders (although his inclusion of Cornel West, among the harshest   critics of President Obama, could be seen as a rather curious middle finger to the Democratic Party’s leader and most popular figure). So now that’s settled, and even if the committee has some spirited arguments, most Democrats, not to mention most Americans, aren’t going to be all that concerned with what’s in the platform, an almost entirely symbolic document. We can ask what else Bernie Sanders wants, and the answer is less than clear. He’d obviously like to influence Clinton’s eventual presidency, with input on appointments and policy choices. The problem is that at this point, he has almost nothing left to bargain with. We tend to talk in vague terms about things like “unity,” so it’s helpful to get as specific as we can. Sanders can no longer beat Clinton. So let’s say he feels that he’s not getting what he wants out of this negotiation. What can he do to force her to be more accommodating to him? There are really only two things:  Cause some kind of disruption at the convention, which will look bad for Clinton. Tell his supporters not to vote for her.  And that’s it. Is he actually willing to do either of those things? Just this morning, his campaign is explaining away his offhand comment yesterday that the convention could be “messy,” making clear that he wasn’t trying to issue a threat, just saying that there will be vigorous debates. So he doesn’t seem to have any appetite to recreate the 1968 Chicago convention. And would he tell his supporters not to vote for Clinton? That wouldn’t just be the final card he could play, it would also be the end of any hope he’d have at retaining influence in the future. If Sanders did that, he’d be done as a political force in American politics. Why do I say that? Sanders may have been a political independent throughout his career, but now that he’s playing at a much higher level than he used to, any influence he has is going to have to come within the Democratic Party. And if he tells people not to vote for the Democratic nominee, he will have banished himself. To Democrats everywhere, he’ll be the guy who tried to get Donald Trump elected because Hillary Clinton wasn’t nice enough to him. If Trump actually won, Sanders would be Ralph Nader times 100, without even the remotest bit of plausibility Nader had in denying that he was responsible for George W. Bush winning the White House in 2000. And if Clinton won even after Sanders tried to destroy her, he’d have zero chance of having his requests considered by the White House mail room intern, let alone the president. He’d also gain the eternal antipathy of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate.    Despite Hillary Clinton having an almost unassailable lead in the delegates needed to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, her opponent, Bernie Sanders, celebrated his primary victories and shifted his focus toward California, while speaking in San Jose on May 18. ( ;   McClain, The Washington Post)   It’s also important to understand that if Sanders tried to convince his supporters to reject Clinton, it almost certainly wouldn’t work. Yes, there would still be a few of the “Bernie or Bust!” folks we see on the news, but they’re a small and shrinking fringe even among Sanders supporters. Once the general election is underway, almost everyone who voted for Sanders will see the election not through a frame pitting Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders, but through a frame pitting Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump. In that context, not voting for her will take on a very different meaning. We know this, because we’ve seen it before. This isn’t the first contested primary in American history. If you look back over previous elections, what you see is that contested primaries don’t produce   defections in the general election. Here’s a chart showing the proportion of crossover votes  —   Democrats voting Republican and Republicans voting Democrat:     What we see here, first, is that Democratic loyalty increased as conservative Southern Democrats switched parties and became Republicans, a process that started with the civil rights efforts of the Johnson administration and was essentially complete by the time we got to the 2000s. But more importantly, we see   defections in either party not because of something that happened in primaries, but because of what’s going on in the general election, usually when there’s a blowout, like many Republicans voting for Johnson in 1964 or Democrats voting for Nixon in 1972. And the most recent era of the last four elections is characterized by unwavering partisanship, with at least nine out of ten partisans sticking with their party, no matter what happened in the primaries. So if Sanders tried to get his supporters to turn against Clinton, he’d probably fail. And at this point, anything he does that makes life more difficult for Clinton will likely hurt him more than her. Let’s think back to 2008, when not only did Clinton get behind Barack Obama after a primary race that ended on much more bitter terms than this one, she did so in a public, dramatic way. When the delegates were formally presenting their votes in a roll call on the convention floor, they arranged it so that New York’s votes would put Obama past 50 percent of the delegates. Standing amidst her state’s delegates on the floor, Clinton made a motion to suspend the roll call vote and declare her former opponent the party’s nominee by acclamation, to the rapturous cheers of the crowd. As a piece of political theater, it was pure genius. It sent a signal of unity to Democratic voters, making her voters feel better about supporting him and his voters feel better about her. And in the process, it helped ensure Hillary Clinton’s future in the Democratic Party. It told everyone that she was a team player, that she wasn’t consumed by resentment, and that she’d be enthusiastically supporting the party’s champion and, everyone hoped, the next president. Had she gone off in a huff and given sullen interviews to the press about how she really deserved to be the nominee, it’s a good bet that Obama wouldn’t have named her Secretary of State, and she wouldn’t be where she is now. Will Sanders do something like that? I have no idea. But he surely understands that he’s in a difficult position, and he has a great deal to lose if he doesn’t play this right. If he were to actually try to get his supporters not to back Clinton, even they would realize that it would be for nothing but spite  —   not a more liberal party, not policy concessions (because by doing that he’d give up any chance of achieving those things) but just spite. So he can’t plausibly threaten to walk away from this strange negotiation. He can make his case for two more weeks until the last big primary day. Then he’ll have to find a way to take whatever Clinton is willing to give him and get behind her  —   and at least pretend that he’s happy about it.  "

","     Hillary Clinton swung and missed earlier this week when asked to respond to a highly critical State Department inspector general’s report regarding her decision to exclusively use a private email server while serving as secretary of state. Her initial response, delivered in an interview Wednesday with Univision’s Marie Elena Salinas, was robotic and rotely defensive  —   not to mention inaccurate on several points. To her credit, Clinton (and her team) realized that what she had said wasn’t enough. So she set about trying to fix it. She called in to Chuck Todd’s ”Meet the Press Daily” on Thursday and offered this up:  I said this many times, it was still a mistake. If I could go back, I would do it differently. And I understand people have concerns about this, but I hope and expect voters to look at the full picture of everything I’ve done and stand for. And the full threat posed by Donald Trump. If they do, I have faith in the American people that they will make the right choice.  Why is this so much better than Clinton’s answer to Univision? Let’s count the ways: 1. She says she made a mistake: Every time Clinton talks about her email issues  —   particularly in light of the State Department IG report  —   she should make sure to include the phrase ”I have acknowledged and continue to believe this was a mistake.” Even if she doesn’t believe that  —   and it’s virtually impossible to know whether she does  —   saying it disarms people. It shows them that she gets it  —   that she ”would do it differently” if she could go back. Contrition in politics is a very good thing. It can buy you tons of goodwill. And Clinton needs that. 2. She doesn’t dismiss people’s concerns, but adds context: Aside from using the word ”mistake” the   important thing Clinton did in her interview with Todd is acknowledging that ”I understand people have concerns about this.” As I have noted many times before, whether Clinton thinks the emails are a big deal (she doesn’t) is immaterial. Poll after poll shows people don’t believe she is honest and trustworthy  —   numbers that have gone up since Clinton has been embroiled in the email mess. That’s not a coincidence. Clinton’s next line  —   ”I hope and expect voters to look at the full picture of everything I’ve done and stand for”  —   is the pullback move that she needs. Look, Clinton is saying, you may not like how I handled this email situation, but look at my life in public office. It shows a commitment to service and to getting things done with a giant bureaucracy that helps mitigate any concerns you might have with the email issue. That line  —   and appeal for more context  —   won’t win over conservatives who believe her career is riddled with other events that show that the email controversy is more rule than exception. But it might help Clinton rally Democrats to her cause and win over some wavering independents. 3. She reminds people that the only other choice they have in this election is Donald Trump: Clinton’s best message in the race is: ”I am the person not named ’Donald Trump’ running for president.” Clinton references the ”full threat posed by Donald Trump” in her interview with Todd for this very reason. Hey, you might not like or trust me, she is saying, but that’s almost besides the point. I am running against someone who could pose a very real danger to this country. Do you want that? This is a binary choice election. (Sorry Gary Johnson!)  There are only two people who have a legitimate chance of being the 45th president of the United States. Clinton doesn’t need to beat the ideal choice for Republicans; she just needs to beat Trump. Driving home that point again and again and again is Clinton’s best strategy. Ideally, Clinton would have offered this response as soon as she was asked about the IG report on Wednesday. She didn’t, but she deserves some credit for figuring out the right answer  —   eventually.           The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we’ve learned from them.    Caption   Clinton has come under fire for using a private email address during her time as secretary of state.

","     By now, Hillary Clinton almost certainly expected that she would be well into a general election fight against Donald Trump  —   punching down at the   real estate developer amid polls showing her sweeping into the White House. Not so much. Instead, Clinton spent the week in California, fighting for votes in advance of the Golden State’s June 7 primary against the   challenge of Bernie Sanders. But that was a cakewalk compared with what came out of Washington on Tuesday.  The State Department’s inspector general released an   report detailing a series of missteps made by Clinton when she decided to exclusively use a private email server and address for all of her electronic correspondence as the nation’s top diplomat. Here’s the key snippet, as reported by WaPo’s Rosalind Helderman and Tom Hamburger: The inspector general, in a   review obtained Wednesday by The Washington Post in advance of its publication, found that Clinton’s use of private email for public business was “not an appropriate method” of preserving documents and that her practices failed to comply with department policies meant to ensure that federal record laws are followed. The report says Clinton, who is the Democratic presidential   should have printed and saved her emails during her four years in office or surrendered her   correspondence immediately upon stepping down in February 2013. Instead, Clinton provided those records in December 2014, nearly two years after leaving office. Clinton initially sought to downplay the report as old news. ”It’s the same story,” she told Univision anchor Maria Elena Salinas. ”Just like previous secretaries of state, I used a personal email. Many people did. It was not at all unprecedented.” Except that it was. While other secretaries of state had used personal email addresses, none of them had exclusively done so. And as Helderman and Hamburger noted, the State Department IG report scolded Clinton not only for using the email address exclusively but also for   the release of those emails to the State Department.    As Donald Trump amps up his attacks against Hillary Clinton, here’s what   comedians Seth Meyers, Conan O’Brien and others have to say about the rivals. (The Washington Post)   For Clinton, who has struggled for more than a year with how to best respond to the email problem  —   and to the broader honesty and trustworthiness questions it raises  —   it was exactly what she didn’t need as she seeks to finally close out Sanders and unite the party in the face of a surprisingly strong showing by Trump in early general election polls. By Thursday night, Clinton was calling in to cable shows to revise and extend her initial dismissiveness about the IG report. Too late. Damage done.

212364,Does Hillary Clinton face a different standard for honesty?,Washington Post,Janell Ross,F,2016-05-29,2016.0,5.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160530000537/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/29/does-hillary-clinton-face-a-different-standard-for-honesty/,"On the list of topics that researchers  —   sociologists, political scientists, economists, criminologists, workplace   pollsters and even biologists  —   have been known to study is honesty. And with reason. Honesty underpins the function of our courts and our personal relationships, our electoral system, our   operations and our workplaces. And in the world of   studies, a   exists: These researchers examine what role, if any, gender plays in honesty. With all the talk this week and during this entire campaign about honesty, transparency, emails and tax returns in the 2016 race, The Fix thought it was time to examine just how gender and honesty play out in politics. Do voters have different expectations for honesty among male and female politicians? And, if they do, what do these dynamics mean for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the likely   White House nominees, whose honesty has often been called into question (Clinton for her alleged secrecy and Trump for his many false statements)?    As Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump escalated his personal attacks against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and her husband, she berated his stance on worker’s rights, gender equality and immigration in Detroit on May 23. (Reuters)   What follows is a Q&A conducted via email and edited for clarity and length. First, meet our experts. THE EXPERTS Kelly Dittmar is an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers   and a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) also at Rutgers. Dittmar’s work involves both research on the role and influence of women and politics and advancing women’s political representation and power. Her 2015 book “Navigating Gendered Terrain: Stereotypes and Strategy in Political Campaigns” investigated how gender influences campaign strategy and campaign institutions. Dittmar has not been involved in any of the presidential campaigns but does manage a nonpartisan project of CAWP and the Barbara Lee Family Foundation called Presidential Gender Watch 2016. Presidential Gender Watch tracks and analyzes gender dynamics in the 2016 race. Julie Dolan is a professor of political science at Macalester College in Minnesota. Dolan began graduate school in 1992, the election cycle often described “Year of the Woman,” when women ran for and won seats in Congress at historic levels. She’s been studying women and politics ever since. Dolan is the lead author of the 2016 edition of “Women and Politics: Paths to Power and Political Influence. ” The book, first published in 2007, was updated in 2010 and this year. A fourth revision of the book is scheduled for release following the 2016 presidential elections. Dolan has donated what she described as a “small amount” to Clinton but has not otherwise been involved in any of the presidential campaigns. THE QUESTIONS THE FIX: I get the sense this is an interesting time for political scientists focused on women voters and candidates. Beyond the obvious  —   a historic candidacy  —   is there anything else that keeps your work compelling right now? DITTMAR: Women voters are key to any election, especially at the presidential level. They outnumber and outvote men, and have done so since 1980. Since then, there has also been a persistent gender gap in presidential vote choice, with women more likely to support the Democratic candidate and men more likely to support Republican candidates. There is no expectation that this will change in 2016. However, this year provides an important reminder that women are not a monolithic voting bloc. While we often talk about women voters collectively or “the women’s vote,” there are key differences among women by race and ethnicity, party and ideology, and age, among other things. For example, while the majority of women are Democrats, Trump’s gender problems have put a spotlight on Republican women  —   a group of women voters often overlooked. How are Republican women reacting to Trump? And will his gender strategy be effective with GOP women (and which GOP women) as we move toward Election Day? At the same time, women of color  —   black women, specifically  —   fuel much of the gender gap that gives Democratic candidates an advantage. Black women voted at the highest rate of any race and gender subgroup in 2008 and 2012, and 96 percent of black women voted for Barack Obama. Will they turn out at similar rates to support 2016’s Democratic nominee? And what strategies will be key to ensuring enthusiasm and equitable levels of engagement? Last, there has been some discussion of Clinton’s “man problem” in a race against Trump, but talking about men and women’s voting behavior requires historical context. I recently wrote about this for Presidential Gender Watch 2016, showing that Clinton’s support among men is consistent with past Democratic nominees, while Trump’s support among women is well below average at this point in the race. DOLAN: Absolutely. Her candidacy raises questions as to whether any woman can be president of the United States, whether female presidential candidates can ever overcome voter stereotypes and media narratives that question women’s suitability for the White House. Clinton is the most experienced candidate in the field, but campaign rivals Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are leveling attacks against her that she’s not qualified for the job. In doing so, they’re playing into a   narrative that women lack what it takes to succeed in the   world of politics. The fact that two   male candidates are leveling this attack against her is telling. Neither Trump nor Sanders feels compelled to shore up their own credentials or justify their own relative lack of experience because they don’t need to; they benefit from a gendered double standard where men are automatically presumed qualified for public office and women are not.    Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a rally on May 26, 2016 in Billings, Mont. (Spencer   Images)  THE FIX: How much do American voters care about honesty in a presidential candidate? DITTMAR: It’s not surprising that American voters say they value honesty in a presidential candidate. In fact, you would hope that’s a credential desired in any elected officials. However, I do think there is a difference between what voters want and what they expect in politicians. For example, just 29 percent of voters in a 2015 Pew poll said elected officials are honest. Unfortunately, then, the bar is low. At the same time, a Quinnipiac poll from earlier this year showed that just 16 percent of Democrats and 23 percent of Republicans rated honesty and trustworthiness as most important when asked to rate those traits alongside other key indicators of vote choice, like caring about needs and problems of people like them, being a strong leader, having the right experience, sharing their values, and having the best chance of winning. That may explain why political scientists David Holian and Charles Prysby found that presidential candidates viewed as most honest in recent elections have not often won. DOLAN: They care, but it’s not typically at the top of the list of desired character traits. In voting for the president, voters tend to prioritize masculine traits (toughness, decisiveness) over feminine traits (empathy, honesty). Because honesty is considered a feminine trait, it carries less sway with voters than do other competing traits.     THE FIX: Do voters expect female candidates to be more honest than male ones?  DITTMAR: Research on gender stereotypes has shown that women are often perceived as more honest than their male counterparts. For example, a 2014 Pew poll found that 34 percent of respondents believe that women in   political offices are better than men at being honest and ethical, while just 3 percent see men as better on the same traits. These perceptions can be advantageous to women. Some research, like Kathleen Dolan’s 2004 book, [“Voting for Women”] has found that voters most concerned about honesty in government were more likely to vote for women candidates. [Editor’s note: Kathleen Dolan and Julie Dolan are not related.] Political consultants I spoke with in my book talked about women’s “virtue advantage” as beneficial in crafting female candidates’ images and messages. However, opponents  —   especially men  —   who are aware of that advantage are quick to develop strategies to eliminate it, raising questions about women’s honesty and integrity whenever given the chance. Those attacks may be more effective against women than men because women are held to a higher standard on honesty and ethics. In other words, since voters are more likely to expect women to be honest, the penalty to women for appearing dishonest may be greater than it is for men. DOLAN: Voters typically draw on gender stereotypes in evaluating political candidates and tend to punish candidates who diverge from gender expectations. Because the generic female candidate is presumed more honest than the generic male candidate, voters judge a female candidate more harshly if she appears to violate the expectation of honesty. For male candidates, dishonesty is problematic but the critique is muted because generic male candidates are presumed to be somewhat less honest from the start. THE FIX: How do those dynamics effect Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump?  DITTMAR: This week’s   poll finds that Clinton and Trump are rated equally poorly when it comes to perceptions that they are honest and trustworthy. Less than   of voters view both Clinton and Trump as honest and trustworthy, while 57 percent do not view either candidate as holding these traits. These ratings may indicate perceptions of honesty and trustworthiness may have relatively little influence on outcomes this year, since no candidate appears to have an advantage. However, if women are held to a higher standard of honesty and integrity, Clinton’s honesty problem may actually have more detrimental effects than if she were a man. Trump’s “Crooked Hillary” moniker indicates that he will work to ensure that Clinton’s dishonesty is front and center in voters’ minds, contributing to these negative effects and deflecting attention from his own problems with truthfulness. Still, if voter surveys are any indicator, it’s likely that other considerations will matter more to voters’   in November. That may be why Clinton has focused more on Trump’s lack of qualifications to be president, emphasizing the risk of having him in the Oval Office. While both candidates would do well to improve voter perceptions of their honesty, they face steep climbs in reversing reputations and will confront continued obstacles in the form of increasing negative attacks on past and present behavior. As a result, they may well have to find other sites on which to distinguish themselves from each other and position themselves as best suited to be the next commander in chief."
212533,How Bernie Sanders missed his chance to beat Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,John Wagner,M,2016-06-05,2016.0,6.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160606000233/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bernie-sanders-missed-his-chance-to-beat-hillary-clinton/2016/06/05/5dc4c12e-28ec-11e6-a3c4-0724e8e24f3f_story.html,"There was a time when Bernie Sanders, the stiff, white senator from Vermont, seemed painfully out of place in black churches. But not now at the end of the long primary trail, and not in Oakland, Calif. at the Allen Temple Baptist Church.  Summoning congregants last week in a historic East Oakland sanctuary that helped give rise to the civil rights movement and the Black Panther Party, he spoke passionately about the plight of many blacks: Too many children are raised in poverty, too many youths can’t afford to go to college and can’t find jobs, too many adults are locked in jails. The system is rigged against them, and he vowed to change it.  The audience rose in applause and affirmation. There were hurrahs and smiles and shouts of “Amen!” At last, Sanders had convinced African Americans that he understood their story  —   and, at last, they seemed to understand his. Only it was too late. By the time Sanders showed up in Oakland, he had effectively lost his chance to be president. Even an unexpectedly lopsided win in Tuesday’s California primary would almost certainly not be enough to stop   Hillary Clinton from clinching the Democratic nomination. For all that Sanders has achieved  —   turning a protest movement into a viable run, gaining mainstream acceptance for his democratic socialist views, pioneering a new way to fund campaigns and pushing his adopted Democratic Party to the left on trade, Wall Street and other issues  —   his campaign for president is also a story of   .      Since March 15, roughly the midway point in the primary season, Sanders has fought Clinton to a draw  —   he has won about as many contests and almost the same number of pledged delegates as Clinton. A comeback victory in California, a state with demographics that have favored Clinton elsewhere, would be  another triumphant   win that would make it even harder for Sanders to accept defeat. “Bernie didn’t grow up thinking he was going to be president,” said former Vermont governor Howard Dean, a Clinton supporter. “To come as close as he has, it’s damn hard to let go. ” According to interviews with the candidate, his advisers, allies and other Democrats, Sanders fell short because of missed opportunities, a failure to connect with key constituencies and stubborn strategy decisions. Perhaps the campaign’s biggest mistake was not realizing early on that Sanders could win. That led to a slow start, both in building the infrastructure needed to run a national campaign and in Sanders’s own presence among voters who knew little about him. “I don’t think anybody had figured out how to win when we got in,” said senior strategist Tad Devine. “It was ‘How do we become credible?’ ” As it became clear that Sanders was gaining credibility, though, he struggled to connect with black and Latino voters, as well as with older Democrats, groups that carried Clinton’s candidacy. Sanders repeatedly clashed with another vital constituency  —   the party leaders whose votes as superdelegates he would ultimately need to pry the nomination away from Clinton. Sanders also overestimated the power of his economic message and, adamant that he run the kind of positive campaign that had been his trademark in Vermont, initially underestimated the imperative to draw sharp contrasts with Clinton.   Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders criticized both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump while speaking in San Diego, Calif. June 5. Sanders is fighting hard for votes ahead the California primaries June 7. (AP)   “His economic message has been pretty powerful  —   so powerful that you feel elements in what Hillary is saying now,” said David Axelrod, chief strategist on President Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns.  But, he said, “there’s a story about this old blues player, Papa John Creach. One guy says, ‘He has only one riff,’ and his friend goes, ‘But it’s a great riff.’ “Bernie is Papa John Creach,” Axelrod continued. “He’s got a great riff but doesn’t have a lot of variety. ” Slow start with blacks Late last year, as part of his effort to establish himself among black voters, Sanders led the media on a walking tour of the impoverished Baltimore neighborhood of Freddie Gray, the black man whose death following an incident with police had sparked rioting in the city. Sanders encountered   rowhouses, corner convenience stores with bars on the windows and trash strewn about the streets. He was trying to show that he gets it, but his comments instead underscored the different world he and his wife, Jane, inhabit in Vermont, a rural state that is 95 percent white. Describing the scene before him as a “Third World country,” Sanders said that “a few blocks away from where we live, there’s a very nice grocery store, a supermarket. We buy   food, produce, at a reasonable price. You don’t have that here. ” Sanders had a personal connection he could have shared with black voters  —   he attended the March on Washington in 1963 and got arrested while protesting school segregation in Chicago  —   but he was initially reluctant to open up about it. Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who campaigned for Sanders across the country, said she pleaded with Sanders to talk more about his own history in the civil rights movement. “Tell your story, and weave it into your platform,” Turner said she told him. But she said her advice was not always heeded: “He doesn’t like talking about himself. ”  The first big test of Sanders’s appeal to African Americans came in February in South Carolina.  He hired staff members to coordinate African American outreach. He aired ads on black radio stations. He deployed an eclectic group of   validators, including former NAACP head Benjamin Jealous, scholar Cornel West, rapper Killer Mike and actor Danny Glover. But nothing seemed to work  —   and Sanders wasn’t connecting on his own. “Bless his heart, I don’t think he has been around people of color a lot,” said Gilda   a prominent black state senator in South Carolina who stayed neutral in the primary. “I saw him speak, and he didn’t slow down. He didn’t read his audience  —   body language, faces, a certain cadence. No slowing down to receive or acknowledge affirmation or an ‘Amen’ here or there. He was brusque. He didn’t appear to feel comfortable  —   and it showed. ” Justin T. Bamberg, among a   black state legislators who supported Sanders in South Carolina, said, “It was an uphill battle from the beginning,” made worse by the fact that Sanders did not do enough retail politicking. “That’s just how things are down here,” Bamberg said. “It makes it seem like you care enough to visit, and that can go a long way. ” Then there was Sanders’s message. His diagnosis for what ails the country is essentially a     overarching sense of economic injustice. But many Democrats, particularly African Americans, say race also factors heavily into the economic plight of blacks. “How deeply the rules of the game are slanted against people of color  —   that was an element that he had to figure out how to do more with,” said Dean, a former Democratic National Committee chairman. “His core is fighting for   people, a classic class analysis. But race is just as big a deal in this country. ” Sanders got crushed in South Carolina, losing 73 percent to 26 percent. The margin would be similar in a string of Southern primaries that quickly followed, cresting with a   loss in Mississippi in early March. Sanders was never likely to win in the South against the Clintons and their long history with African American voters, but it was those enormous margins that allowed the former secretary of state to build an insurmountable delegate lead. In the 15 states that have already voted and that have a larger proportion of African Americans than the United States as a whole  —   most of them in the South  —   Clinton has won 353 more pledged delegates than Sanders. In the other 34 contests, Sanders had won 78 more pledged delegates than Clinton, as of Saturday. “Clearly, we did very poorly in the South,” Sanders said in an interview. “There’s no ifs, ands or buts about that. ” He said that his appeal to African Americans has improved as the campaign has continued, but he attributed that to voters’ being more familiar with him rather than anything he has done differently. Turner, the former Ohio state senator, said his performance among fellow African Americans “keeps me up at night. ” She said that Sanders’s economic and   proposals clearly would benefit African Americans but that Sanders needed more time to become a known commodity. “He’s coming into his own now,” she said, “but it’s June. ” Iowa’s effect on his run Part of Sanders’s strategy to win heavily African American states was to win the three that came before them: Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. The Sanders team reasoned that they had a shot in all three and that running the table would provide momentum and buzz and, in the words of Devine, would “open the door” in the South. Nonetheless, Sanders did not go all out for months after his April 2015 announcement. Aides said he felt strongly about maintaining his workload in the Senate, so trips to Iowa, New Hampshire and other states were mostly confined to long weekends. At first, Sanders also eschewed retail politics. Sometimes after campaign rallies, Sanders made a beeline to his car rather than sticking around to greet voters one on one or posing for selfies. By contrast, Clinton sprinkled roundtable discussions and    visits to coffee shops throughout her itineraries. Sanders sought to create momentum by drawing huge crowds to rallies, many in liberal cities that were far afield from the early voting states. His aides argued that the news coverage justified the strategy for such an unknown candidate, but others said it cost him where the first votes would be cast. “I think that the gigantic rallies were seductive to the Sanders campaign, but they don’t translate in Iowa as well as the   discussions,” said Jerry Crawford, a veteran Iowa Democrat who chaired Clinton’s state campaign. Nonetheless, by December, a little over a month before the Iowa caucuses, the Sanders team started to sense that they could win the kickoff contest, Devine said. The Clinton campaign soon sensed it, too. Specifically, it saw one number in Ann Selzer’s poll for the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics that spooked them. Two weeks before the caucuses, 43 percent of probable   Democrats described themselves as socialists. “That meant that all Bernie had to do to win the Iowa caucuses, literally, was get 7 percent of everyone else who didn’t call themselves a socialist,” Crawford said. “To me, it’s still a miracle that he didn’t. ” When the Sanders campaign aired an ad in which Sanders says, “It’s called a rigged economy, and this is how it works,” Clinton allies sensed more trouble. Jeff Link, who ran Obama’s campaigns in Iowa, said he called Clinton’s state director, Matt Paul, and said, “Dude, you’ve got a problem. ” In the end, Clinton eked out a victory by 0. 3 percent of the vote. It was an unexpectedly strong showing for Sanders, but it wasn’t enough to fundamentally alter the Democratic race or overcome the near nonstop media focus on Donald Trump and the Republican nomination battle. Clinton’s victory had been built precinct by precinct over nine months. By caucus day, Sanders had hired his own army of staff and organized in all 99 counties, but it was too late to catch up.  “There was a path for Senator Sanders to win . . . but it would have needed   execution and a worse candidate than Hillary Clinton,” said R. T. Rybak, vice chairman of the DNC and a former Minneapolis mayor. Inside the Sanders campaign, a common lament was that there were not enough days on the calendar. Sanders’s wife, Jane, a political strategist in her own right, said as much as she talked with reporters aboard her husband’s campaign plane after the first string of states. “I would have like to have had more opportunity to just camp out down in South Carolina, so they could know him,” she said. “That wasn’t an option. . . . We needed to be in Iowa, we needed to be in New Hampshire, we needed to be in Nevada, then we needed to be in South Carolina. It’s just timing. Time was the enemy for this part. ” Attacks on Clinton One of the biggest adjustments Sanders made between his early losses and later wins was to start attacking Clinton with gusto. What had started as an early point of pride for Sanders, that he did not go after Clinton, eventually gave way to an aggressive effort to contrast their positions, question Clinton’s judgment and knock her for accepting   speaking fees from Wall Street firms and for refusing to release transcripts of those remarks. Some Sanders allies say adopting the tougher posture sooner could have made a real difference  —   putting Clinton on her heels and bringing to fore more of the vulnerabilities that are now weighing down her favorability. “Running for office is about attention,” Turner said. “It doesn’t have to be going for someone’s jugular, but you need to draw the contrasts. I wish he had started off that way. ” Burt Cohen, a former New Hampshire state senator who served on Sanders’s steering committee there, said Sanders could have been more aggressive about highlighting Clinton’s ties to the moderate wing of the party in a year when base voters wanted a progressive nominee. “But he is who he is,” Cohen said of Sanders. “He’s a gentleman, and he was hesitant to go after Hillary. ” Squaring off for the first Democratic debate in October, Sanders famously declared that people were “sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,” a reference to the drumbeat of news coverage about Clinton’s use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. The remark was widely lauded and seen as a sign of Sanders’s authenticity, but Turner said that moment also “set the stage in some people’s minds that he wasn’t a fighter. ” Devine said “the initial calculation was from him, that we shouldn’t talk a lot about the peripheral issues having to do with the Clintons. ” That meant the email controversy and questions about the Clinton Foundation were largely  . The Sanders team also calculated that, had he attacked her early, he would have invited an equally aggressive posture from Clinton and her allies, including a   super PAC. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver disputed the suggestion that Sanders should have gone negative on Clinton sooner. “You have to introduce yourself to voters for them to understand who you are and what you stand for,” he said. “You can’t start a campaign by drawing contrasts. ” How will it end? The remaining question for Sanders is how he plans to end his campaign. Sanders insists that he will not drop out Tuesday when California and five other states vote, even if a combination of superdelegates and the pledged makes clear that Clinton has claimed the nomination. The final Democratic contest is the following Tuesday in the District of Columbia. And he is vowing to press ahead to the Democratic National Convention in July in Philadelphia. Sanders hopes to persuade enough of the 718 superdelegates  —   elected officials and other party elites not bound by the outcome of the contests in their states  —   to switch their votes. His argument: Polls show him performing better against Trump in    matchups than Clinton. It is painfully ironic for Sanders that his fate will be determined by the Democratic establishment with which he has zealously sparred throughout his congressional career. Axelrod recalled attending Senate Democratic caucus meetings where Sanders, an independent who caucused with the Democrats, was a loner. “Bernie would always be off by himself,” Axelrod said. “He was with them and not of them. In certain ways, that’s worked for him here. Having been in Congress for 25 years, he can credibly claim not to be part of the establishment. But that can be costly when you have to count on the establishment to buoy your candidacy. ” As of this weekend, 547 superdelegates had publicly announced support for Clinton, while Sanders could claim the backing of only 46. Sanders’s effort is considered a long shot if not an impossibility by most political observers, but Sanders said getting even this far was once seen as equally implausible. “When we started the campaign, people didn’t know Bernie Sanders or what our agenda was,” said Sanders, who originally budgeted $30 million to $50 million but so far has raised and spent more than $200 million. “This campaign has done what many people thought was impossible. ” Ralph Nader, a former Green Party presidential candidate who, like Sanders, has operated as a leftist outside the   system, said the normalizing of socialism has been one of Sanders’s biggest achievements. “Socialism used to be a   word,” Nader said. “He has brought the word into the mainstream and made class distinctions central to his campaign. He’s ended the taboo. ” As Sanders traveled in his Secret Service motorcade between campaign stops in California, he said he is not looking back. “My focus is today,” he said, “and not worrying about what I could have done six months ago. ”  Wagner and Costa reported from Washington; Rucker, from Oakland, Calif."

She and her primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) deserve credit for competing largely on issues rather than insults. From here, she will have to contend with a Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has sent every signal that he will run a campaign that is entirely disrespectful  —   of her personally, of the truth, of minority groups, of the media and of a variety of basic democratic norms.  As her recent speech attacking Mr. Trump on foreign policy showed, Ms. Clinton will argue that she is steady and reasonable where Mr. Trump is temperamental and unhinged  —   and she will have plenty of reasons and opportunities to argue that he is unfit to be president. Yet if she is going to be the candidate of dignity and political responsibility, she will have to do some things differently if she does not also want to be the candidate of rank hypocrisy.  One of the many political norms that Mr. Trump has set about eroding is transparency, with his fidelity to certain lies and his refusal to release his tax returns, despite decades of contrary precedent. Ms. Clinton has released a trove of tax records but for months has declined to honor another essential expectation of the nation’s leaders and   leaders: She has not held a real news conference since December.  In response to criticism of this inaccessibility, Ms. Clinton says she has offered some 300 personal interviews since her last news conference, and her campaign points out that she has held a handful of short, informal “gaggles” with the traveling press this year. Neither is a reasonable substitute for regularly facing the media. Candidates are less likely to face   and tough questions and   in carefully managed interviews, where time is often limited and there is usually only one interlocutor, than they are from a room full of reporters for an extended period of time.  Ms. Clinton may calculate that holding news conferences is not in her political interest. In the early days of her campaign, some of her lowest moments came during freewheeling exchanges with the press corps, such as when she lamely attempted to joke her way out of answering a question about her State Department emails. But news conferences are not a frill to be jettisoned out of political calculation. If Ms. Clinton is unavailable to legitimate questioning now, what hope would there be once she is in office? Mr. Trump’s irresponsibility does not give her a pass to ignore the legitimate demands of democratic transparency.   Read more on this topic:   Ruth Marcus: Hillary Clinton’s   damage   E. J.

212585,What Hillary Clinton would do to America,Washington Post,Max Ehrenfreund,M,2016-06-07,2016.0,6.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160608002340/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/07/what-hillary-clinton-would-do-to-america/,"Hillary Clinton has accumulated enough support to secure victory in the Democratic primary, advancing to face a Republican opponent almost no one predicted at this time last year. Her long   battle with Bernie Sanders pushed her to more liberal positions on a handful of issues, most notably the minimum wage and international trade, but neither it, nor the expected dynamics of her general election contest with Donald Trump, appears to have fundamentally changed the issue set that Clinton hopes to ride to the White House. Clinton kicked off the 2016 campaign talking about inequality, corporate greed and the struggling middle class. She’s still talking about those issues and still framing many of them through a set of   policy proposals that often focus on what you might call ”  issues” for families. Her ideas rely on a combination of added government regulation, particularly in labor markets, and increased federal spending, in areas such as education and child care. She has said what two of her top priorities would be  —   overhauling the immigration system and spending hundreds of millions more on infrastructure  —   and has hinted strongly that they would be joined, at the top of her list, by policies that would affect working women in particular, such as mandatory paid family and medical leave.   [What Donald Trump wants to do America]     [What Bernie Sanders wants to do to America]   Unlike Trump, who has offered few specifics on his agenda and has at many times taken contradictory positions on issues, Clinton has laid out a consistent and largely detailed agenda, although some questions remain (such as what top corporate tax rate she favors). It is well described as an extension of President Obama’s agenda  —   with a notable deviation on trade  —   and because she has put flesh to it, it is easier to summarize and to critique than Trump’s. Here are the highlights of her plans: Family leave One of Clinton’s goals is to help workers take time off the job to care for loved ones. Under her plan, every worker would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of paid family leave and an additional 12 weeks of paid medical leave. While on leave, the government would pay these workers   of what they make on the job in order to replace their wages. The money would come from increased taxes imposed on the wealthy. That last point is a difference between Clinton and Democrats in Congress. They have proposed a similar program but one that would be funded through an increase in the payroll tax, one that all workers would pay.    Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tells a software design company she is a ”very strong supporter” of paid family leave. (Reuters)   Early education Early education is another component of Clinton’s plan to help families get by. Clinton has called for additional federal funding for education for young children, funding that would be administered by the states under her plan. She has said that her goal is for no family to have to spend more than 10 percent of their income on child care. Many economists argue that quality education in early childhood can help children succeed later on in school and in adulthood, and that too often, older children and young adults who grew up with disadvantages early in their lives can’t catch up to their peers. They say early education is one of the most profitable investments society can make in the economy of the future.   [Why conservatives should get behind Obama’s push for universal  ]   Minimum wage Clinton has said she thinks the federal minimum wage should be increased, but she has only gone as far as endorsing a $12 hourly minimum. While she has said that local governments should be free to set minimums above that level if they choose, her position has been a disappointment for activists who have campaigned for $15 an hour. In a recent debate, Clinton did say she would be willing to sign a bill setting the federal minimum at $15 an hour if Congress presented her with one, but it is not the policy she prefers.   [What Hillary Clinton actually thinks about the minimum wage]   Immigration Clinton has said that one of her immediate priorities, if elected, would be to extend President Obama’s executive actions on immigration, giving a broad group of undocumented immigrants the opportunity to apply to law enforcement for a reprieve from deportation. The courts, however, have stymied Obama’s most recent effort to give temporary relief to several million undocumented immigrants. Whether Clinton would be able to do any more depends on whether the courts agree that the president has the authority to do more.    Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spoke passionately about the desire to stop deporting immigrants who entered the country illegally and to provide a path to citizenship at The Washington   debate in Miami. (Sarah   Washington Post)   Infrastructure Another immediate priority next year for Clinton would be asking Congress to make a major investment in roads, bridges, railways, airports, water systems and other physical infrastructure. Her aides have suggested she’ll ask for at least $275 billion. Trade Clinton has withdrawn her support for Obama’s international trade deal, called the   Partnership, which she helped negotiate when she served as his secretary of state. In general, though, she has said that she is willing to support trade agreements if they satisfy certain conditions. ”I did say, when I was secretary of state three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard,” Clinton said at a debate in October, referring to the   Partnership. ”It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn’t meet my standards, my standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans.” Wall Street Hillary Clinton has said that the largest banks should be dissolved if they pose a risk to the economy, repeating what has been a rallying cry for the progressive movement in the Democratic Party and for her rival in the primary, Bernie Sanders. What breaking up the banks would mean in practice isn’t completely clear. As president, Clinton could try to appoint regulators who would take a hard line with the banks, using the authority that Congress granted them in the   financial reform in 2010 to force them to dissolve. Doing so would involve declaring the banks a grave risk to the economy or deeming them unable to withstand a crisis in an orderly way.   [Hillary Clinton may be ready to break up the big banks]   Clinton has also proposed a graduated tax on banks’ liabilities, which would penalize the largest institutions and counteract the advantages that they arguably receive from their size. In addition, she favors stricter requirements to force banks to rely on shareholders rather than depositors and other banks to fund their operations, so that in the event of a crisis, losses would be contained to shareholders.

212586,How Hillary Clinton did it the second time around,Washington Post,Karen Tumulty,F,2016-06-07,2016.0,6.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160608002340/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-hillary-clinton-did-it-the-second-time-around/2016/06/07/9218d622-2c20-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html,"NEW YORK  —   Even before the polls closed in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton knew she was in for a very bad night. The establishment worrywart caucus was freaking out, and the media was rife with speculation of an imminent staff  . Was she once again being set up for a fall, a lumbering   about to be toppled by a charismatic outsider? Her answer: Get me a bigger plane. Robby Mook, her   campaign manager, blanched. But Clinton insisted that she did not want her aides trickling back to the Brooklyn campaign headquarters, one by one, nursing their dejection. Everyone would fly together. As 30 or so aides boarded, Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, stood at the top of the stairs, shaking each one’s hand and thanking them.   Iowa voters at a Clinton rally in Des Moines in January. (Melina   Washington Post)  It was not just a gracious gesture. Clinton wanted to send a signal, one that would be understood internally, even if it took the rest of the political world a while to catch on. She and her team had a plan. She believed in it. They were sticking to it. Hillary 2. 0 would be very different from her 2008 operation, which had run aground in part because her campaign had failed to master the fundamentals. All over the map, they had been outmaneuvered; even where Clinton won, Barack Obama’s more nimble and sophisticated team had somehow managed to squeeze out extra delegates. Like Mook, Marlon Marshall had been a part of that failed effort. When he joined the 2016 campaign as its director of state campaigns and political engagement, Marshall recalled, “one of the first things that Robby and I talked about was, what is our delegate strategy?” Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont proved to be a formidable opponent. His   message was in tune with the disgruntled left, and he raised money by the boatload. The first sign came in September, when he raised more than $25 million  —   just $3 million less than she did. They also knew that the money and the enthusiasm of his supporters meant that Sanders could stay in the fight even as Clinton built up her delegate lead  —   and methodically snuffed out any realistic chance he had of securing the nomination. The real surprise was how things played out on the other side.   Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton celebrated her wins in an address to supporters in Brooklyn, N. Y. on June 7. Here’s her full speech. (Associated Press)   Clinton’s advisers had expected the Republicans, with their enormous field of candidates backed up by super PACs, to also have a   battle. Although her campaign chairman, John Podesta, had been predicting privately since last summer that Donald Trump would be the GOP   none of her advisers expected him to clinch it as suddenly and decisively as he did. After Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) beat Trump in Wisconsin, Clinton’s advisers even held a planning session to get up to speed on how a contested Republican convention would work and figure out what that meant for them. Instead, when Cruz dropped out in early May, Clinton was effectively running two campaigns at once  —   the final stages of a primary race and the opening ones of a general election. Clinton has never been a dazzling campaigner. Not one for   she prefers small, scripted settings where she can discuss the policy intricacies of heroin addiction, mental health treatment, college debt or gun control  —   all the while keeping her campaign press corps at arm’s length. There have also been times when her   could be spectacular. In March, during a CNN town hall in Ohio, she boasted that she was the “only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country,” and added: “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. ” Those words came back to haunt her in West Virginia. “I do feel a little bit sad and sorry that I gave folks the reason, or the excuse, to be so upset with me, because that is not what I intended at all,” she told an    miner who confronted her about that comment. Meanwhile, old questions about her character have been revived by an FBI probe into the security issues raised by her unauthorized use of a private email system while she was secretary of state. And Democrats, unlike Republicans, are not generally receptive to   by their failed candidates. They prefer to turn the page. So it was both poignant and ironic that the day Clinton would celebrate making history as the first woman to clinch a major party’s nomination was also the eighth anniversary of her concession to Obama. That speech is remembered mostly for the line in which she declared that she had put 18 million cracks  —   the number of votes she had gotten  —   in “that highest, hardest glass ceiling. ” But there was also what, in retrospect, sounded like a declaration that she would be back. “Life is too short, time is too precious and the stakes are too high to dwell on what might have been,” Clinton said. “We have to work together for what still can be. ” Iowa: A test of lessons learned “What have you done for Iowa today?” read the message Mook had scribbled on a whiteboard in Brooklyn. Whenever someone would erase it, he would write it again. The way they ran Iowa was to be the test of whether Clinton and her team had really learned from their mistakes. And in the end, it was also a caution. They barely squeaked by Sanders, who had gotten a late start there and who did not have anything close to Clinton’s organization. His huge rallies, and the fire he lit with young people in particular, stoked worries that Clinton might be in for a replay of 2008. “We said from the beginning it was going to be close, that we weren’t going to take anything for granted and that we were going to have to compete for every single supporter” in Iowa, recalled Matt Paul, her state director. “All of those things turned out to be true. ” Still, a win was a win, and it was also a little bit of insulation against Sanders’s   blowout eight days later in New Hampshire. Conceding in New Hampshire, Clinton was already looking forward to South Carolina and Nevada, both of which have more racially diverse populations than the first two states. “Crack down on corporations that game the system. Stop other countries from taking advantage of us with unfair trade practices,” she said, in a nod to Sanders’s populist lines. “But even all that is not enough,” she added. “We also have to break through the barriers of bigotry. African American parents shouldn’t have to worry that their children will be harassed, humiliated, even shot because of the color of their skin. Immigrant families shouldn’t have to lie awake at night listening for a knock on the door. LGBT Americans shouldn’t be fired from their jobs because of who they are or who they love. ” It was within the minority communities that she would gain traction. Her campaign had considered Nevada’s caucuses what one aide called “a coin flip,” but she won by a surprisingly comfortable five points. And in South Carolina, the margin was a staggering 48 points. Averaging across all the primaries, Clinton won 78 percent of African American voters, to Sanders’s 21 percent, and Latinos by 60 percent to his 39 percent. Among whites, he narrowly edged her out, 49 percent to 48 percent. The age disparity was also significant  —   and worrisome for Clinton, who needs younger voters to rally around her this fall, as they did for Obama. Sanders won Democrats ages 18 to 29 by a   margin in primary season. The two candidates ran close to even among voters in their 30s and 40s. Clinton carried older voters handily, winning the    age group, which made up 40 percent of the Democratic primary electorate, by an average of 28 points. But Mook’s mantra remained the same: It’s all about the delegates. After his loss in South Carolina, Sanders barely contested   states in other parts of the Old South, concentrating instead on places where he could beat Clinton  —   such as Oklahoma. That made sense in some way, in that it maintained the appearance of momentum and kept his supporters’ enthusiasm going. “They were going for wins, instead of spreading out their resources to narrow the margins everywhere,” a key calculation, given the Democrats’ system of proportionally allocating delegates, said one top Clinton campaign aide, giving a frank assessment in return for anonymity. “It was a strategy for staying in the race. It wasn’t a strategy for winning,” the aide added. At one point in April, Sanders could count seven victories out of the previous eight contests. But that string of wins did little to cut into Clinton’s delegate lead, thanks to the way the Democrats’ proportional system works. In Wyoming, for instance, he got 56 percent of the vote, but he and Clinton came out with seven delegates each. Yet Sanders’s superior financial resources required Clinton’s campaign to make some calculations of its own. Clinton had to be careful, for instance, in deciding where to buy television advertising. Instead of running spots in the expensive Dallas market, for instance, the campaign bought time in Waco, which was cheaper and had the potential to yield more delegates. Macon, Ga. made more sense than Atlanta because the campaign could reach into more congressional districts while spending less. “Even though no one would have fathomed it, we ended up being the leaner, meaner campaign and were more efficient,” said spokesman Brian Fallon. In accumulating delegates, Mook thought there were three big milestones: March 1, a. k. a. Super Tuesday, when there were contests in a dozen states and territories, including Texas and Georgia; March 15, another big round, including Florida, Ohio and Illinois; and a smaller trove on March 26, which would make her lead all but insurmountable. In retrospect, those contests turned out to be as decisive as she had hoped. As of last weekend, Clinton held a lead of roughly 290 pledged delegates  —   nearly half of which could be attributed to Texas and Florida alone. But there were also miscalculations, the biggest of which was Michigan. Just days before the March 8 primary, public surveys had Clinton up by double digits; Sanders ended up winning by a point and a half. Clinton strategists do not have an explanation for what went wrong. They say their internal polls had the race much closer. But they also acknowledge that they made a mistake by concentrating their efforts in Detroit and Flint, while neglecting the rest of the state. It was a mistake they vowed not to repeat. By the beginning of May, they faced a delicate dilemma. Clinton did not want to appear dismissive of Sanders or the fact that there were more primaries to go. But with the GOP contest over, they could not afford to wait any longer to get on a   war footing. The campaign started quietly staffing up in the battleground states and now has state directors, as well as communications and organizing operations, in 10 of them. Looking ahead to Trump One of the things that has worried some Democrats is the question of how a    candidate like Clinton would deal with someone as wildly unconventional as Trump. When violence broke out ahead of a Trump rally in Chicago in March, forcing him to cancel, he took to television to encourage his fans to blame Sanders’s supporters. Clinton remained silent for hours, and her initial response was tepid. It was not until the next day that she accused Trump of setting the tone that encouraged the melee. “If you play with matches, you’re going to start a fire you can’t control,” she said in St. Louis. But she found her footing more quickly the night of the Pennsylvania primary. Trump, with the GOP nomination in hand, had been vowing to recalibrate his style and become more presidential. His chief strategist, Paul Manafort, had assured members of the Republican National Committee in a   briefing that the real estate mogul had merely been playing a part in the primary, that Trump would begin “evolving into the part that you’ve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change. ” That was exactly what Clinton and her team expected as well  —   and it worried them. But so far, those fears haven’t been realized. In the car on the way to the airport in Philadelphia, they heard of Trump’s latest fusillade. “Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5 percent of the vote. The only thing she’s got going is the woman’s card,” Trump said. “And the beautiful thing is, women don’t like her. Look how well I did with women tonight. ” On the short flight to Teterboro, N. J. they deliberated what to do. Should she express outrage? Should she dispute the fairness of what he had said? As it happened, the campaign’s digital staff had already prepared a video of one of Clinton’s   lines, which she had repeated that night: “If fighting for women’s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in. ” “That,” communications director Jennifer Palmieri told the others on the plane, “is our only response. ” In retrospect, Palmieri said, “that was the night he became the Republican nominee. It was important to freeze that moment in time. ” The next two days saw the biggest online fundraising of the entire campaign. In San Diego last week, Clinton eviscerated Trump in a speech billed as a foreign policy address. Her technique was to use Trump’s own words to make the case against him. Her allies cheered. “It put a lot of Democratic   on pause,” said one campaign official. “Now they can visualize how we will take the fight to him. ” Campaign officials said they are already planning a similar speech focused on the economy. But they also insist that they cannot count on the Republican nominee to be his own undoing. “We can’t go into it thinking our opponent will excite our base. We have to give people a reason to vote for us, too,” Marshall said. “We have an opportunity to go out there and earn it. ” Clinton has already made history by locking up the nomination. And she has shown that she can learn from her own mistakes. Now comes the biggest chance of all, and this time, there will be no margin for error.

It was a historic moment  —   but she and the nation have little breathing space to savor the milestone. There is, first, the question of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( . ). Mr. Sanders has fought hard, and he has won much along the way. The issues that matter to many of his supporters, such as income inequality, financial reform,   expansion and campaign finance, have come front and center  —   with Ms. Clinton’s campaign paying them more attention than might otherwise have been the case. But Mr. Sanders has also lost by every measure: delegates, primaries, total votes. It’s time for him to concede while there is still a chance to do it with grace and to clear the road for Ms. Clinton to battle Donald Trump. That raises the second question: What kind of campaign will Ms. Clinton wage? We hope she will focus on more than the negative. It’s understandable for Ms. Clinton to run an   campaign in the face of his unprecedented ugliness and bigotry. Yet surely one effective antidote to his vacuity would be substance; one answer to his divisiveness: a commitment to civil dialogue and a respect for independents and Republicans who will disagree with many of her views. Ms. Clinton was widely praised, for example, for her searing attack last week on Mr. Trump’s unfitness to lead as commander in chief. Fine, but as the presumptive Democratic nominee, she also needs to fill in the blanks of her own   intentions. A day after that speech, 13 military and diplomatic leaders wrote a letter to President Obama pressing him not to withdraw more troops from Afghanistan during the rest of his term. What is Ms. Clinton’s view on that question? Her   speech offered no clue, but voters deserve to know. As we noted recently, her refusal to hold news conferences doesn’t help. Ms. Clinton began her campaign  —   long, long ago  —   on the premise that voters would embrace an experienced leader offering substantive, pragmatic policy proposals. With Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders ascendant, the market for substance and pragmatism came to seem limited at best, and Ms. Clinton understandably made some course corrections. But her initial judgment about what the nation needs was right. Now she has a second chance to explain how her deeply held convictions would influence her policymaking, and how she would accomplish her policy goals in what will remain, no matter which party controls Congress, a deeply divided country. As the first major female presumptive nominee in the nation’s history, Ms. Clinton is already a role model of one kind. In providing a positive, substantive platform over the coming months, she could become a role model of another important sort  —   a leader who respects the art of governing, the fragile beauty of our constitutional system and the prerogatives of its citizens to make an informed choice.

And not only that! Obama was delivering the endorsement via a prerecorded video, recorded on Tuesday    48 hours before he even sat down with the senator from Vermont. White House press secretary Josh Earnest insisted the meeting with Sanders was not simply a ”formality.” And, apparently, Obama had told Sanders on Sunday that he was planning to endorse Clinton. Still, the whiplash    as it played out on cable television    was hard to ignore. So, why did Obama endorse Clinton when Sanders’s body, politically speaking, was still warm? A few reasons. 1. Obama is a pragmatist Obama, whose brand is built on idealism (that ”hopey, changey” thing) is actually a brutal pragmatist. It annoyed him back in 2008 that Clinton kept running despite the fact that she had no path to victory. And, during his presidency, he’s shown time and again that he’s not a big believer in tilting at windmills. That’s exactly what Sanders  —   and many of his supporters  —   are doing right now. ”Well, if we flip 400 superdelegates, then . ..” is not a winning campaign strategy. Obama knows that    and doesn’t feel the need to suffer the   arguments of people who came up short. Which leads me to this . .. 2. Obama is (still) the president and the head of the Democratic Party Here’s the thing: Barack Obama doesn’t need to (really) worry too much about the blowback he might get from some corners of Sanders supporters. He’s a   Democratic president. He’s the first black president. His support among Democrats is soaring.     Unlike Clinton, who has to carefully manage every moment of her    and her campaign’s    interaction with Sanders between now and whenever he decides to endorse, Obama is free to sort of do what he wants. He gave Sanders the full White House meeting treatment and, with that box checked, he did what he wanted to do. Here’s a live look at Obama:     3. Obama wants the party unified ASAP Obama is aware that Clinton and Donald Trump are running close in most national polls.     And he also knows that the longer a rump Sanders faction is left on its own, the longer it will take to focus on what he believes to be the real enemy: Trump in the White House. ”It was important to let the primary process play out, but the time to unify and get on with the business of beating Trump is getting short,” said Dan Pfeiffer, who served as Obama’s senior adviser in the White House. Democratic pollster Paul Maslin added that ”[Clinton] needs a solid stretch well before Philadelphia. And to see if she can open up a genuine   to   lead again.”   Obama getting on board so soon after the primary process effectively concluded    D. C. holds the official final primary vote on Tuesday    is the best way to avoid any messiness and distraction before Democrats convene late next month in Pennsylvania. That’s why he did it when he did it. Mostly because (a) he could and (b) he thought it was the right thing for the party.

One of the Senate’s most moderate Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, left that option open in an interview this week with the New Yorker.   Here’s the full Susan Collins exchange. Says it’s unlikely but possible she’ll vote Hillary. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Josh Barro (@jbarro) June 9, 2016  This is pretty rare    at least in recent history. When parties were more fluid in the 19th century, this kind of thing happened all the time. But   presidential endorsements have dropped off a cliff as parties have solidified    nay, calcified    into the two very separate factions they are today. To that point, Collins reiterated it’s unlikely she’d vote for Hillary Clinton. And we can see why; voters don’t seem particularly enamored with the idea, at least when it comes to their own  . As our own Philip Bump explored recently, the phenomenon of voting for a senator from one party and a presidential candidate from the other is the lowest it’s been in decades:    (Philip Bump   The Washington Post)  That partisanship has filtered up to the Senate, where nowadays supporting the other side’s presidential candidate is often met with punishment, either from one’s party or the voters, said Donald Ritchie, a former official historian for the U. S. Senate. ”It’s very, very difficult for them to step outside their parties in a way that you could 40 or 50 years ago, when the Senate was much more independent,” he said. The Fix spoke to Ritchie and Robert David Johnson, a history professor at Brooklyn College, to learn more about those moments in American history where senators have defected during a presidential campaign    and what happened to them because of it. Here are some notable cases, in chronological order. 1916: When you ask senators or historians to name some of the chamber’s greatest members, Robert La Follette, a Republican from Wisconsin, inevitably comes up. He’s credited with being a leading figure in the progressive movement (the parties were, of course, different back then). The 1916 presidential election was the   to America’s involvement in World War I, and these progressive Republican senators liked the other side’s approach to try to stay out of it. La Follette led a small handful of senators in ”effectively communicating they would not be unhappy with” Democrat Woodrow Wilson winning reelection, according to Ritchie. But Ritchie notes this wasn’t a formal endorsement of Wilson    just a nudge in his general direction. 1924: A few years later, La Follette ran for president, this time as a candidate of the Progressive Party, which he formed specifically to run. His entry made it a   race between him, President Calvin Coolidge and John Davis, a   Democratic member of Congress. For many progressive Republican senators and even some Democrats, La Follette’s party became a kind of de facto Democratic Party challenge to Coolidge, since progressives on both sides of the aisle weren’t fans of the more conservative Davis. Democratic Sen. Burton Wheeler of Montana ended up being La Follette’s running mate on the Progressive Party ticket. But the   support from his colleagues wasn’t enough: Coolidge’s   win margin in the popular vote was among the largest in presidential history. La Follette came in third. 1948: The prospect of war again divided some factions of a party. Sen. Glen Taylor, a colorful cowboy and Democrat from Idaho, was concerned his party’s president, Harry Truman, was leading the nation to the brink of war with the Soviet Union. So he endorsed Henry Wallace, a peacetime candidate running under the Progressive Party. ”I knew I would probably kill my chances of being   in 1950 if I threw in with Henry,” Taylor told a newspaper in 1948, according to his obituary in the New York Times. He was right. Wallace ended up naming Taylor his vice presidential pick. They failed to win any state in the general election, and afterward, Taylor’s state party tried to kick him out. Two years later, Taylor lost his reelection. 1960: If it’s not war dividing a party, it’s a safe bet that religion is. Catholic presidential candidates in particular have struggled to hang onto some of their party’s members. In 1960, John F. Kennedy’s nomination caused some Southern Democrats to defect. They ended up voting for their colleague, Sen. Harry Byrd from Virginia, a conservative leader in the Senate and notable opponent of school desegregation. Byrd was never on the ballot, but he got 15 electoral votes from states like Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma. 1964: Conservative Republican Barry Goldwater’s 1964 Republican nomination caused a lot of heartache within the parties (and he remains the presidential hopeful most often compared to Donald Trump). Much of the unsettled feelings on the Democratic side stemmed from the Civil Rights Act, which President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law a few days before the Republican presidential convention. Around that time, Sen. Strom Thurmond, a Democrat from South Carolina and one of the Senate’s most vocal opponents of the law, defected from his party to support Goldwater. And he never looked back. For the rest of his life, Thurmond was a Republican, and his switch was a key flashpoint in the   political realignment. Thurmond ended up being one of the   senators in U. S. history. 2004: Zell Miller, a conservative senator from Georgia, was one Democrat who didn’t switch parties during that realignment (which is still going on to some degree today). But in 2004, he crossed over and supported President George W. Bush’s reelection campaign, even speaking for Bush at the Republican convention. (Miller holds the distinction of being one of the few people to be keynote speakers at both party’s conventions.) The two had been acquainted when they served as governors, and Miller said he respected Bush’s commitment to tax cuts. In a sense, Miller was already on his way out of the Democratic Party. He wasn’t running for reelection, and before endorsing Bush he published a book: ”A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat,” in which he criticized the party for being too liberal and elitist. He left the Senate shortly after Bush’s reelection, joined a law firm and got a gig on Fox News. 2008: Joe Lieberman, a former senator from Connecticut, has lived several different political lives. He was originally elected as a Democrat, and he was Democrats’ vice presidential nominee in 2000. But after losing his 2006 Senate primary, he switched to his own party    ”Connecticut for Lieberman”    and won in the general election. He became an ”independent Democrat,” and showed that independent streak two years later when he endorsed Sen. John McCain ( .) for president. As a result, he almost lost his powerful seat chairing the Senate’s homeland security committee    but Democrats decided to let him keep it. He retired from the Senate in 2013."
212960,Hillary Clinton hit a milestone today! And it wasn’t a good one!,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-06-21,2016.0,6.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160622000502/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/21/hillary-clinton-hit-a-milestone-today-and-it-wasnt-a-good-one/,"Hillary Clinton delivered a speech savaging Donald Trump’s business acumen and economic plans in Ohio on Tuesday. It was just the sort of address we’ve come to expect from Clinton during her two presidential bids: deeply researched, well argued and strongly delivered. It also had one other thing that has become a much more disturbing pattern for Clinton the candidate: a total lack of real interaction with the media who cover her. In fact, today marks 200 days since Clinton has held a formal press conference of any sort. 200!   The last time @HillaryClinton held a press conference: December 4, 2015 200 DAYS AGO  —   GOP (@GOP) June 21, 2016  The last time Clinton held a news conference, not a single vote had been cast in the Democratic primary contest. The idea of Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee was still greeted with (mostly) eye rolls and laughs. And the State Department inspector general’s office hadn’t issued a scathing report on Clinton’s decision to exclusively use a private email server to conduct her electronic correspondence while serving as the nation’s top diplomat. That’s remarkable. And remarkably bad.   [  urges ’lone wolf patriots’ to attack Black Lives Matter activists at GOP convention]   The Clinton campaign always points to the fact that she regularly does sitdowns with the media  —   usually on Sunday talk shows. Which is fine. But it’s not the same thing as facing more than one reporter in a press conference setting. It’s like a reverse ”Princess Bride”:  The goal of this strategy is simple: limit Clinton’s exposure in a format in which she is not terribly comfortable. Need proof? Look how Clinton ”handled” the media during her first press conference after the story of her private email server’s existence broke. It was not so good.  It makes sense as a campaign strategy. But that doesn’t make it right. Clinton is one of two people running to be the most powerful person in the world. Part  —   I would argue a big part  —   of that job is an ability to think on your feet, to deal with questions that you didn’t expect and, more importantly, questions you don’t really want to answer. By bunkering herself away from the media, Clinton doesn’t stretch that muscle  —   and robs voters of a chance to see how she might think and act in a pinch in the White House. Clinton’s willingness and ability to keep the media at arm’s length is part of a disturbing trend pursued by Democrats and Republicans alike in recent years. The rise of Flickr, YouTube channels, Twitter, Facebook and a thousand other technological innovations has made it incredibly easy for candidates to   the media  —   pushing their message undiluted to their supporters. What all of that   doesn’t and can’t do is this: convince anyone not already for you of anything. The media are the lone referee  —   or the only people who can possibly play referee. You may not like the referees. But you do need to deal with them.

A large portion of his speech criticized Clinton’s record as secretary of state and donations given to the Clinton Foundation, as outlined in Peter Schweizer’s book, “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich. ” One of the strongest charges Trump made was that Clinton “ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others and really many, many others in exchange for cash. ” But Trump offered little evidence to back up this charge, which doesn’t make much sense beyond being an easy soundbite. It ignores the fact that the actions of Clinton and Clinton Foundation have been heavily scrutinized over the years, and that critics, including Schweizer, have not been able to prove quid pro quo.

213147,Hillary Clinton’s email story continues to get harder and harder to believe,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-06-28,2016.0,6.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160629080155/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/28/hillary-clintons-email-story-continues-to-get-harder-and-harder-to-believe/,"On Monday night, the Associated Press published a piece noting the release of an additional 165 pages of emails Hillary Clinton sent from her private email address while serving as secretary of state. These were emails that had never been previously released and only were made public because of a court order in response to a request from a conservative group. And  yet again, the emails poke holes in Clinton’s initial explanation for why she decided to exclusively use a private email server for her electronic correspondence while serving as the nation’s top diplomat. Let’s start with this from the AP story: ”The emails were not among the 55, 000 pages of   messages that Clinton turned over to the agency in response to public records lawsuits seeking copies of her official correspondence.” Remember that Clinton and a small group of people working for her reviewed all of the emails she sent from her private server and made the decision about what was solely personal and what was  . She handed over the   email and permanently deleted those that she and her team decided were purely personal.  She wound up deleting more emails than she turned over to State.     The latest batch of emails suggest that Clinton’s filter to decide between the personal and the professional was far from foolproof. That these emails never saw the light of day before Monday  —   or before a conservative legal advocacy group petitioned for their release  —   opens up the possibility that there are plenty more like them that Clinton chose to delete but shouldn’t have. And it provides more fodder for the Republican argument that Clinton appointing herself as judge, jury and executioner for her emails was, at best, a very, very bad decision and, at worst, something more nefarious than just bad judgment. Then there’s this quote from a newly released March 2009 email between Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin about the email setup: ”I have just realized I have no idea how my papers are treated at State. Who manages both my personal and official files? . .. I think we need to get on this asap to be sure we know and design the system we want.” Hmmm. Remember that Clinton said that her   reason for using a private email server while at State was ”convenience.” She didn’t want to carry around multiple devices for email, she explained. But this email to Abedin  —   which came at the start of her   term in office  —   suggests a bit more active agency than Clinton has previously let on. ”I think we need to get on this asap to be sure we know and design the system we want,” doesn’t strike me as Clinton simply wanting convenience and following the instructions of her IT people on how to make that happen. It reads to me as though Clinton is both far more aware of the email setup and far more engaged in how it should look than she generally lets on publicly. There’s nothing in these emails that changes the basic political dynamic of the email controversy as Clinton seeks to win the White House this fall. Everything still depends on whether the Justice Department decides to indict Clinton or those close to her for purposely keeping information that the public had a right to know away from them. We’ve been waiting on the results of that FBI investigation for months now and, in truth, no one really knows when they will finally come. But revelations like Monday’s  —   a chunk of previously undisclosed emails that are clearly professional in nature  —   lend further doubt to the story Clinton had told about why she set up a private server and how she handled it after leaving office. For a candidate already struggling to convince voters she is honest and trustworthy enough to be president, stories like this one are deeply problematic.           The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we’ve learned from them.

213149,Pro-Trump group’s ad misrepresents Hillary Clinton’s comments about women,Washington Post,Michelle Ye Hee Lee,F,2016-06-29,2016.0,6.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160629080155/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/29/pro-trump-groups-ad-misrepresents-hillary-clintons-comments-about-women/,"“So who is all for women until she isn’t? When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, ‘Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believed.’ But when another Bill [Clinton] was accused of sexual assault? Not so much.   …     She savaged their dignity and shamed them. [Shows a video clip of Clinton saying] ‘Some folks are going to have a lot to answer for. ’”  —  Voiceover and video clip in political ad by   Trump group Rebuilding America Now This political ad by a   super PAC attacks Hillary Clinton over her response to women who made sexual allegations against her husband. The ad begins with a reference to a post on Twitter by the Hillary Clinton campaign, noting it was published “when Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault. ” The ad goes on to say that she reacted differently to allegations about her husband. “She savaged their dignity and shamed them,” the narrator says, as the following text appears on screen: “The Clinton effort used words like ‘floozy,’ ‘bimbo’ and ‘stalker. ’” Then a video clip airs of Clinton saying, “Some folks are going to have a lot to answer for,” and gives the impression that she was making those comments in response to the women who had made sexual allegations against her husband. We looked at two problematic elements in the ad: the misleading impression about Clinton’s tweet, and the misleading use of the video clip. The Facts Clinton’s tweet The ad claims: “When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, ‘Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believed. ’” (This is a common comparison being made among Clinton’s opponents, including by Trump himself  —   drawing attention to similarities between allegations made against Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton. For more, see our guide to the sexual allegations against Bill Clinton.)   Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported. https:  .   —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 23, 2015   The tweet includes a link to her plan to address campus sexual assault. It makes no reference to Cosby or the women whose sexual assault lawsuits were pending at the time. Clinton’s campaign said the tweet was posted to coincide with the national premiere of CNN’s “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about campus sexual assaults. The tweet was posted nine minutes after the premiere was scheduled to air, at 8 p. m. Eastern. Supporting information provided by the super PAC doesn’t make the direct connection, either. A representative said “it is impossible to imagine that Hillary Clinton was unaware of the Bill Cosby scandal, which had [been] playing out on the news for months, on exactly the same topic as her tweet, when she tweeted out ‘women had a right to be believed.’ It is fair to assume she understood her tweet would read in that context of the larger story about sexual assault not just a specific instance of campus rape. ” Many Twitter users responded to Clinton’s tweet at the time by pointing to the women who made sexual allegations against Bill Clinton. If the super PAC wants to make the argument that Clinton tweeted this during a time when there was public interest in the Cosby case, that needs to be made clear in a way that doesn’t mislead viewers to believe that the tweet was in reference to the Cosby lawsuits. Less than two weeks after the tweet, Clinton was asked during an event about the women who made sexual allegations against Bill Clinton, and whether she holds the same view that sexual assault victims deserve to be believed: “You say that all rape victims should be believed, but would you say that about Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey   Paula Jones? Should we believe them as well? All Clinton offered in response was: “Well, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence. ” That second part  —   that women should be believed “until they are disbelieved based on evidence”  —   was not mentioned in her tweet. ‘Some folks are going to have a lot to answer for’ As the narrator claims, “She savaged their dignity and shamed them,” the ad shows text from a January 2016 article by the New York Times about Hillary Clinton’s feminist supporters struggling to reconcile her “leadership on women’s issues with her past involvement in her husband’s efforts to fend off accusations of sexual misconduct. ” The specific words shown on screen (“floozy,” “bimbo,” “stalker”) are attributed to the “Clinton effort,” though not directly to Clinton herself: Over the years, the Clinton effort to cast doubt on the women included using words like “floozy,” “bimbo” and “stalker,” and raising questions about their motives. James Carville, a longtime strategist for Mr. Clinton, was especially cutting in attacking Ms. Flowers. “If you drag a   bill through a trailer park, you never know what you’ll find,” Mr. Carville said of Ms. Flowers. (Mr. Carville has maintained that earlier reports indicating that he had made the remark about Paula Jones, another Clinton accuser, were incorrect.) Then, a clip is shown of Clinton saying, “Some folks are going to have a lot to answer for,” apparently discrediting the women. Again, there is problematic juxtaposition of information presented to viewers. A reading of the full Jan. 27, 1998, interview on “The Today Show” makes it less clear that Clinton is referring to the women when she talks about “some folks. ” This interview was conducted a week after the president was accused of having an affair with Lewinsky, but Lewinsky denied it at the time through an affidavit from her lawyer. (For more details on the timeline, see our earlier   on this issue.) Clinton refuses to answer specifically about the alleged affair with Lewinsky. She repeatedly says the matter needs to be placed “in context,” and places the blame on people in a “vast   conspiracy” who have tried to discredit her husband for 25 years. This interview certainly was pivotal to saving Bill Clinton’s presidency, as his wife forcefully backed him. While this interview often is referred to as a political attack on Lewinsky and Jones, by Hillary Clinton’s account at the time her husband had not yet admitted the Lewinsky affair to her. The full context of her answer (claim used in the ad is in bold): Matt Lauer: “Let me take you and your husband out of this for a second. Bill and Hillary Clinton aren’t involved in this story. If an American president had an adulterous liaison in the White House and lied to cover it up, should the American people ask for his resignation?” Clinton: “Well, they should certainly be concerned about it. ” Lauer: “Should they ask for his resignation?” Clinton: “Well, I think that  —   if all that were proven true, I think that would be a very serious offense. That is not going to be proven true. I think we’re going to find some other things. And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for. ” One reading may be that Clinton was referring to the women. But in the context of the earlier questions leading up to that question, she appears to reference her husband’s political opponents, not Lewinsky or any other woman. The super PAC representative said “it is fair to interpret that as a threat that she was going to exploit the ‘past behavior’ and ‘backgrounds’ of those women who accused her husband. ” In particular, the super PAC cited descriptions of the organized effort surrounding the Clintons to “destroy” the women, as described in Barbara Olson’s 2013 book “Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton. ” The Pinocchio Test This ad employs sound, video and text editing to create quite a misleading impression to the viewers. First, the narrator says that “When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, ‘Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believed. ’” Yet the tweet did not mention Cosby. It includes a link to her plan to address campus sexual assaults, and apparently coincided the airing of a documentary on the issue. Later in the ad, the narrator says Hillary Clinton “savaged their dignity and shamed them,” and immediately shows a clip of Clinton saying, “Some folks are going to have a lot to answer for,” implying Clinton was referring to the women. But in the context of the full interview, that’s not exactly clear; Clinton appears to be blaming political opponents of her husband. We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. As regular readers know, editing jobs in political ads that risk misleading the public almost automatically qualify for Two Pinocchios under our standards. The group says it’s “fair to assume” that Clinton would have known that her tweet would read as a commentary on the larger issue of sexual assault, and that it’s “fair to interpret” that her claim in the Today Show interview was a “threat that she was going to exploit” the women. We find that a stretch, and admakers deliberately made assumptions and interpretations to arrange audio, text and video in a way that misleads viewers. That tips it to Three Pinocchios.

213168,The 2016 election is already decided. History says Hillary Clinton wins.,Washington Post,Doug Sosnik,M,2016-06-29,2016.0,6.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160630000404/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-2016-election-is-already-decided-history-says-hillary-clinton-wins/2016/06/28/8c6e682e-3d49-11e6-80bc-d06711fd2125_story.html,"Doug Sosnik, a Democratic political strategist, was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 2000.       If history is any guide, the outcome of this year’s presidential election has already been decided.  With the exception of 2000, the result of every presidential election since, and including, 1980 has been determined before the general election even officially began. In fact, most of these elections were effectively decided by this point in the cycle.   A Washington   News poll shows Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton taking a   lead over Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and a higher percentage of Americans saying she’s qualified to serve as president. (Sarah   Washington Post)   There is no reason to think that this year, as crazy as it has been, will be different. Spoiler alert: Hillary Clinton wins. The single best predictor of the electoral outcome is the job approval of the incumbent president  —   even one who’s not on the ballot. In four of the five elections since 1980 when the incumbent president’s job approval was at or above 50 percent, that party held the White House. The outlier was 2000, when President Bill Clinton enjoyed a 57 percent job approval rating in October yet Al Gore “lost” to George W. Bush. In the three elections when the incumbent’s job approval fell below 40 percent in the final year of his term, the party suffered overwhelming defeats. Some might argue that Jimmy Carter’s experience in 1980 disproves my point about races being decided by this point, but it doesn’t. True, Carter was leading in national polls in a   race (remember John Anderson?) until  . But by June 1980, Carter’s job approval had dropped to 31 percent  —   and it never significantly improved during the remainder of the campaign. The nature of a   race masked the core of public dissatisfaction with Carter and prolonged until the end of the election the consolidation of the nearly 70 percent   vote, which ultimately resulted in Ronald Reagan’s landslide win. By the beginning of the summer of 1980, with 2 out of 3 Americans disapproving of Carter’s performance in office, there was little doubt that the country would not give him four more years.  Three big election moments remain: the selection of the vice presidential nominees, the party conventions and the fall debates. Breathless coverage notwithstanding, none of these has had a measurable impact in changing the outcome of a presidential election in at least 40 years.  The last time a vice presidential selection may have altered the outcome was in 1960, when John F. Kennedy’s choice of Lyndon B. Johnson assured Democrats of carrying Texas. The last time a party’s convention may have changed the outcome was in 1968, when the Democrats suffered four days of rioting in the streets of Chicago. And the last time a debate may have affected the outcome was in 1976, when Gerald Ford mistakenly asserted that “there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe,” effectively ending his surge against Carter. All indications are that the 2016 campaign is likely to continue this pattern.  President Obama’s job approval rating now sits above 50 percent. Significant structural advantages have also favored Democrats since 1992. The party’s candidate has carried 18 states plus the District of Columbia  —   totaling 242 electoral votes  —   in every election since 1992. Now New Mexico and its five electoral votes, which Bush won in 2004, are considered safely Democratic. If those states remain solid for Clinton, that leaves her only 23 votes short of the 270 necessary for victory. Demographic trends since 1992 only reinforce this advantage for Democrats. In addition, Clinton enjoys a significant financial and organizational advantage over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. In the past month, the Clinton campaign has run $23 million worth of ads in eight swing states without any time purchased by the Trump campaign to counter her attacks. Clinton has also maintained a stable campaign team at the top while building a national campaign staff of about 700 people. The Trump campaign, on the other hand, has had constant leadership turmoil with a staff of fewer than 100 people. Lastly, and perhaps most important, never before has a party nominated a candidate as unpopular as Trump is. True, Clinton’s negatives are high  —   but Trump’s are even higher, reaching 70 percent with more than half having a very negative view. And Trump’s party isn’t helping him. According to a recent Bloomberg poll, just   of Americans have a favorable view of the Republican Party. Some 28 percent of   Republicans have an unfavorable view of their own party. Americans view their vote for president differently than for any other office. Ultimately, this is a decision as much emotional and instinctual as it is intellectual. And once voters have made that choice, it is very difficult to dislodge.  Voters have gotten to know Trump over the past year. They have pretty much made up their minds about how they feel. It is very unlikely anything that happens in the remaining 131 days of this campaign is going to change that.

Three   former George W.

I’ll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world. To my Republican friends: I know I’m not alone.” He’s not. And below are the big names that are with him  —   or, perhaps more accurately, with her.

This list focuses on the latter, and it will be updated in the weeks ahead.) Bush administration officials  Henry Paulson, treasury secretary Richard Armitage, deputy secretary of state and adviser to Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush  —   Trump ”doesn’t appear to be to be a Republican, he doesn’t appear to want to learn about issues. So I’m going to vote for Mrs. Clinton.” Brent Scowcroft, chairman of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board and adviser to three previous GOP presidents  —   ”The presidency requires the judgment and knowledge to make tough calls under pressure. ... [Clinton] has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.” Alan Steinberg, regional EPA administrator Kori Schake, National Security Council and State Department aide  Advisers to previous GOP presidents  Doug Elmets, former Reagan spokesman  —   ”I could live with four years of Hillary Clinton before I could ever live with one day of Donald Trump as president.” Jim Cicconi, former Reagan and George H. W. Bush aide  —   ”Hillary Clinton is experienced, qualified and will make a fine president. The alternative, I fear, would set our nation on a very dark path. ”     A Washington   News poll shows Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton taking a   lead over Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and a higher percentage of Americans saying she’s qualified to serve as president. (Sarah   Washington Post)   Foreign policy leaders  Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a   of the Project for the New American Century Max Boot, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser to GOP presidential candidates  —   ”I’m literally losing sleep over Donald Trump. She would be vastly preferable to Trump.” Peter Mansoor, retired Army colonel and former aide to David Petraeus  —   ”It will be the first Democratic presidential candidate I’ve voted for in my adult life.”  Business    Marc Andreessen, venture capitalist  —   ”[Silicon] Valley wouldn’t be here, we wouldn’t be doing any of this if we didn’t have the amazing flow of immigrants that we’ve had in the last 80 years.

213229,Does Hillary Clinton really need Elizabeth Warren on the ticket?,Washington Post,John Wagner,M,2016-07-01,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160702000732/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/does-hillary-clinton-really-need-elizabeth-warren-on-the-ticket/2016/07/01/f5167050-3f02-11e6-80bc-d06711fd2125_story.html,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren looked very much like a running mate as she stood alongside Hillary Clinton and electrified a large crowd in battleground Ohio this week, punching the air, eviscerating Republican Donald Trump and declaring: “I’m with her. Yes, her. ” Not everyone was impressed  —   including some   supporters of Democratic   Bernie Sanders, who remain hostile to Clinton and bitter that Warren ( .) didn’t back the senator from Vermont during the primaries. “If Clinton thinks that picking Elizabeth Warren is going to sweep up all the enthusiasm for Bernie, I just don’t see it,” said Burt Cohen, a former New Hampshire state senator who served on Sanders’s steering committee in the state. “It’s about issues, not about personalities. ” Such sentiments challenge one assumption about Warren as vice presidential nominee: that she would validate Clinton’s progressive bona fides and help bring along disaffected Sanders voters who still view the former secretary of state warily. There are other arguments against Warren, according to allies and advisers from both camps: concern that the country is not ready to support a   ticket; Clinton’s own tendency to avoid risk; her desire to choose a governing partner, not a surrogate attack dog; and the reality that the two women simply do not know each other that well.     We narrowed Clinton’s vice presidential possibilities to 27. Now you pick one. View Graphic        [Clinton and Warren electrify Ohio crowd, sparking visions of a ticket]  There is also the fact that Warren’s interim successor in the Senate would be named by a Republican governor, complicating Democratic efforts to take control of the chamber and help push Clinton’s agenda. And her value is a   sword; even if she does prove effective in rallying the party’s left wing, her star power could show up Clinton on the campaign trail  —   and showcase Clinton’s own struggle to energize these crucial voters. Warren has made no secret of wanting the job, telling MSNBC host Rachel Maddow weeks ago that she considers herself fully able to do it. But even some of her own boosters, who would like to see her on the ticket, are skeptical there is a sufficient well of trust for Clinton to pick her. The two women have had two private meetings that intimates described as remarkably warm and productive. Their most recent, initiated by Clinton ahead of their joint campaign appearance Monday in Cincinnati, included a ride together from Clinton’s hotel to the event site. Boosters of the potential ticket, including Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant based in Boston, argue that adding Warren would “double down” on Clinton’s appeal to women  —   a more important segment of the electorate than ever this year  —   and add an already proven voice for “going after” Trump. Marsh argued that even if Sanders backers are not thrilled about a   ticket now, they would support it in the fall. “How can you call yourself a progressive if you can’t support a ticket of Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren over Donald Trump and    ?” Marsh asked. “That choice is pretty clear. ” Warren, by far the most visible of Clinton’s list of potential running mates, rose to prominence for her sharp criticism of Wall Street’s excesses and fierce advocacy on behalf of the nation’s consumers. Other potential picks are also being vetted by the Clinton team, including Sen. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia, viewed as a safer selection, and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who could energize the Hispanic electorate. At the Cincinnati rally, Warren called Trump “a small, insecure money grubber” and “a   bully who is driven by greed and hate. ” She said he was only interested in making America “great again” for “rich guys, just like Donald Trump. ” She has also engaged Trump in a war of words in one of his favorite arenas  —   Twitter  —   and not pulled any punches in assessing his candidacy or character. “There’s more enthusiasm for @realDonaldTrump among leaders of the KKK than leaders of the political party he now controls,” Warren tweeted in May, for instance. Although Warren’s role as a darling of the left was in some ways eclipsed by Sanders’s rise on the presidential campaign trail, she has   since Clinton assumed the mantle of presumptive nominee  —   and Sanders’s profile has done the opposite. In fact, notwithstanding the many Sanders supporters who say they would never vote for Clinton  —   or who criticize Warren for joining forces with her  —   recent polling suggests that most Democrats have actually lined up behind the presumed nominee. A Washington   News poll released last week showed that only 8 percent of Sanders supporters said they would back Trump over Clinton in the general election, down from 20 percent a month earlier. The greater fear for Democrats is that Sanders voters might simply stay home.  [Trump’s bad month just got worse because Sanders backers just rallied to Clinton]  Leading Sanders supporters say they are focused on the more immediate term, where the chief aim is getting Clinton and the Democratic Party to embrace many of the ideas that Sanders built his campaign around. While they have had some success moving the party’s platform committee in that direction, other Sanders priorities  —   such as universal health care and reining in the nation’s trade policies  —   remain elusive. They also express frustration that the Clinton team has not treated Sanders with the respect they say he earned during primary season, when he won 22 states and 13 million votes. They say putting Warren on the ticket alone will not fix that. “I know that people think he’s easily interchangeable with another progressive, but he’s not,” said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and frequent Sanders surrogate. “It is a mistake to think she could just step in. ” Talks in recent weeks between the Clinton and Sanders campaigns have been largely focused on policy issues, and the   slot has not been a topic of conversation, according to a Democrat familiar with the discussions. In television interviews, Sanders has said he would like to see Clinton pick a progressive. When asked, he has complimented Warren. But Sanders is not publicly advocating for her. There remains the question of what Warren would bring to the ticket  —   and what she would not. RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, the first nationwide labor union to endorse Sanders. said she has heard “zero interest” from fellow Sanders supporters of late about seeing Warren on the ticket. “I’m just not hearing it,” DeMoro said, adding that many Sanders backers were disappointed that Warren endorsed Clinton last month as the primaries wound down. “People think because she’s with Clinton, she’s gone over to the dark side,” DeMoro said of Warren. The Young Turks, an online news network popular with progressives, has held heated debates on whether Warren threw away her credibility by backing Clinton. On a segment about her official endorsement, the network’s major hosts ranged from minor disappointment to rage over Warren’s refusal to back Sanders. “If you’re a Democrat, it’s   to throw a punch against Donald Trump,” said host Cenk Uygur, who frequently introduced Sanders at California rallies. “But it was important to throw a punch against the powerful in your own party and stand up for progressive values. ” Jimmy Dore, another host, argued that Warren lost credibility with progressives when she did not defend Sanders against Clinton’s attacks in the primaries. “You saw what they were doing to him,” Dore said. “You saw them calling him misogynistic. The least you could have done is said: All of that is crap! How dare the liberals and people who call themselves progressives treat the one true liberal in this race like that. That would have been really helpful. ” Neil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America, one of the first groups to endorse Sanders, said such sentiments are not emblematic of where most Sanders voters are. “Frankly, I think it’s a relatively small number of loud voices online who are saying negative things in the wake of [Warren’s] endorsement,” said Sroka, whose group was a member of the effort launched in 2014 to draft Warren to run for president. “The discussion’s a lot more nuanced than that,” Sroka said. “Sure, 98 percent love Warren and would support her no matter what she did, unless it was working for Goldman Sachs or something. There’s also an appreciation for the difficult stance she took. She was the only female Democrat in the Senate who didn’t endorse Clinton. That was a really bold, difficult stance. If anyone’s ever been in a work environment where everyone around you took one side, you know how difficult that must have been. ” Erin Bilbray, a Sanders supporter and member of the Democratic National Committee from Nevada, said she has heard from some “disgruntled” Sanders supporters “whose wounds are still fresh at this point. ” But Bilbray said adding Warren to Clinton’s ticket would be “terrific. ” “Her policies are the kind that brought me to the Sanders campaign in the first place,” Bilbray said. Mike Carberry, a county supervisor in Johnson, Iowa, who backed Sanders, said for some supporters of the senator from Vermont, there is little Clinton can do to bring them on board. “He brought a lot of people into his campaign who are still having a hard time accepting that Bernie may not be the nominee,” said Carberry, who was among those who initially urged Warren to run for president. “The seasoned people who’ve been through this before will get behind Clinton, regardless, because they want a Democratic president. Some of the new converts to politics will take more time to come around. ” On that count, adding Warren to the ticket “couldn’t hurt,” Carberry said.  Karen Tumulty contributed to this report."

Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement Saturday that Clinton “gave a voluntary interview this morning about her email arrangements while she was Secretary,” and added, “She is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a conclusion. ” Asked if the interview, which took place at FBI headquarters, was businesslike and civil, Clinton told MSNBC that it was “both. ” “It was something I had offered to do since last August,” she said, according to a transcript provided by the network. “I’ve been eager to do it, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion. ”  As she has in the past, Clinton asserted that she “never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,” although she said that some might have been retroactively branded classified during the process to prepare it for public release. She said she had “no knowledge” of the investigators’ timeline.    Attorney General Loretta Lynch said July 1 that she will accept investigators’ recommendations on whether or not to bring charges against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her email use while secretary of state. (AP)   The investigation is not over: Agents and prosecutors will now have to compare what the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Saturday to other evidence they have gathered, including from interviews with Clinton’s aides. They will also have to analyze how the facts of the case apply to various laws that might have been violated.  But officials familiar with the probe and legal analysts have said a meeting with Clinton would be reserved for the end of the investigation.   [How Clinton’s email scandal took root]  “That’s certainly a signal that they’re wrapping things up,” said Justin Shur, a former deputy chief of the Justice Department’s public integrity section who is now in private practice at the MoloLamken firm.  A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the Clinton interview.  The past week has been tumultuous for Clinton and the government’s investigation into whether her email system might have compromised classified information. On Monday, former president Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting with U. S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch aboard Lynch’s plane at an airport in Phoenix. Lynch asserted they did not discuss any pending investigations, but the conversation sparked an uproar  —   with some Republicans and Clinton rivals calling for a third party to be appointed to handle the case. Referring to that meeting, Hillary Clinton told MSNBC that “hindsight is  ” and said her husband, like the attorney general, would probably not do it again.

Clinton sat for an interview of more than three hours as part of a Justice Department investigation into the privately owned email system she operated off the books when she was secretary of state. The timing  —   less than three weeks before she will claim the Democratic presidential nomination  —   is an attempt to make the best of a situation that would look bad for any candidate but is particularly damaging for Clinton. That the interview at FBI headquarters was voluntary does not expunge the whiff of suspicion surrounding the entire email affair that, for many voters, confirms a   view that Clinton shades the truth or plays by her own rules.  [FBI interviews Hillary Clinton for more than 3 hours in email probe]  In opinion polls and focus groups, even many people who say they plan to vote for Clinton say they think she has lied or has something to hide. Her poor marks for trustworthiness have much to do with her long and sometimes messy public life, and very little to do with Republican opponent Donald Trump. Both   are deeply unpopular with voters, but Clinton elicits a more visceral mistrust.    In this 2012 file photo, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton checks her cellphone after her address to the Security Council at United Nations headquarters. (Richard  )  It didn’t help matters last week when her husband, Bill Clinton, met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for an impromptu discussion on an airport tarmac in Phoenix, sparking suspicions among Republicans and   among Democrats. Lynch has said the meeting was innocent but regrettable.  [How everyone looks bad because Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch]  “Trust is the glue that holds our democracy together,” Clinton said last week as part of a direct effort to address the issue in this small lull between the end of primary voting and the start of   campaigning for the fall vote. “I take this seriously, as someone who is asking for your votes, and I personally know I have work to do on this point,” Clinton told a friendly audience. “A lot of people tell pollsters they don’t trust me. I don’t like hearing that, and I’ve thought a lot about what’s behind it. ” As she has before, Clinton blamed smears by her political opponents for setting the tone, but she also acknowledged her own mistakes. “You know, you hear 25 years worth of wild accusations, anyone could start to wonder,” Clinton said. “Political opponents and conspiracy theorists have accused me of every crime in the book. None of it’s true, never has been,” but it also never goes away, Clinton said. “And it certainly is true that I’ve made mistakes. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t,” Clinton continued. “So I understand that people have questions. ”   Protesters hold signs outside of a June campaign event with Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, in Cincinnati. (Ty   News)  She promised to try to resolve those doubts through hard work and dedication, and she held up the example of her 2000 election to the Senate. New York voters had doubts, too, but came to know her as a hard worker and effective representative, she said. “You can’t just talk someone into trusting you. You’ve got to earn it,” Clinton said.  [Clinton says she understands many people don’t trust her, promises to earn it]  The longtime   is trying to swab the decks of a messy and bitter primary ahead of the Democratic convention and ahead of a week of   campaigning with President Obama and Vice President Biden. Biden, in an NPR interview Sunday, said a goal in campaigning for Clinton was to “vouch” for her. The two will appear together Friday in Scranton, Pa. which is Biden’s beloved home town and also where Clinton’s father grew up. Her story of the family lace factory there is a staple of her stump speech. “The hardest thing is vouching. When you vouch for them you say ‘I’m putting my reputation on the line. I believe this person is a good person, has character,” Biden said in the interview for NPR’s “Weekend Edition. ” “You’re putting your rep on the line. You’re saying, ‘I think this person has character,’ and that’s what I’m prepared to do for Hillary. ” Character is exactly Clinton’s trouble spot, according to polls that have charted an increase in the number of people who say they don’t like and don’t trust her as the campaign has marched ahead. In an   Street Journal poll in late June, 69 percent of respondents said they were concerned that Clinton has a record or reputation as untrustworthy. A CBS News poll in June found 62 percent saying Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, while 33 percent said she is. Her ratings on this were similar to Trump’s (63 percent not honest, 32 percent honest). But on a separate measure of being forthcoming, 33 percent of registered voters said Clinton says what she believes while 62 percent said she does not. By contrast, 56 percent said Trump says what he believes. People are far more likely to say Clinton is well prepared for the job, while rating Trump as unsuited for the White House, said pollster Peter D. Hart, who oversaw the latest   Street Journal poll. Where she falls down is on the more nuanced question of character and trust, he said. “For Hillary Clinton it’s all personal and about values,” Hart said. “It’s, ‘Can I trust her? Do I feel comfortable with her?’ ” This is somewhat familiar territory for Clinton, who overcame discomfort over her   role as first lady in the 1990s and mistrust of her motives in the 2000 Senate campaign.  “When she won election to the Senate, she had to overcome skepticism in the minds of some voters in certain parts in New York,” campaign press secretary Brian Fallon said in an interview. “She went on to impress everyone with her work ethic and her ability to reach across the aisle, and then managed to win reelection by an even wider margin in 2006. So we know that while the political season brings out all kinds of personal attacks and unfair questioning of her motives, the reality is, once in the job, she never fails to work her heart out and earn respect from even her critics. ” Still, although the old scandals and investigations of the Bill Clinton administration have faded in memory, they are at the core of many voters unease with Hillary Clinton. Trump, in his   style, hits a political nerve with his constant reference to Clinton as “Crooked Hillary. ” Her   tenures as senator and secretary of state are also years behind her, meaning her campaign must seek to remind voters of the positive elements from those periods. Clinton’s campaign is trying to address the trust deficit in two main ways. First, through Clinton’s own words and actions  —   including her remarks on the topic at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition gathering in Chicago last week and in what her backers say was a forthright attempt to provide information to the FBI. Clinton had volunteered to sit for an interview months ago and has said she is cooperating completely in an inquiry that could result in criminal charges for her or aides who sent and received classified material on a system that operated in parallel to government email accounts. From the campaign’s perspective, the interview is medicine best swallowed now, before the full heat of the    campaign with Trump. The issue clouds the campaign nonetheless, since there is no word about whether anyone will face charges or discipline. An interview with the most significant potential target of the investigation is often the last step before a decision on whether to issue indictments, so it is possible that the legal matter is near an end. Lawyers have said charges against Clinton are unlikely. The   House investigation into the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, when Clinton was secretary of state, ended last week with little new or politically damaging information. Clinton backers assert that the tragedy is no longer politically useful for Republicans. Second, the campaign is spending millions on television advertising that charts Clinton’s background as an advocate for children and families and portrays her as a stalwart fighter. The positive ads airing in battleground states are running much more frequently than an attack ad about Trump. The idea is that there is an opportunity now to reset voter opinions about Clinton as a   proposition as opposed to someone in contrast with Trump. Clinton allies note that Trump’s negative ratings are higher than Clinton’s and have concluded they are less likely to change than Clinton’s positive ratings. To Clinton backers, that means it is more   to try to raise her stature now than to further damage his. Super PACs allied with Clinton have begun rolling out potentially damaging information about Trump’s business practices, while the campaign itself concentrates on trying to tell voters what backers have described as “something they don’t know” about one of the   figures in American public life. “Every election is a choice, and we will continue to frame the contrast in this race, and to explain why Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president,” Fallon said. “But we believe in giving voters a sense of Secretary Clinton’s own vision and values, not just emphasizing how Trump is so dangerous and divisive. These early weeks of the summer provide that opportunity, as impressions begin to set. ” A larger problem, however, is that Clinton has always been more popular, and viewed as more trustworthy, when she is doing a job than when she is campaigning for one. “The campaign trail is just not designed to help her with her trust issues,” said Patti Solis Doyle, who managed the first portion of Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential campaign and is now a prominent supporter. “Having said that, I think it is important for her to acknowledge that she has trust issues and to tell voters that she will work to earn their trust,” she added. “It shows that she is in tune with the public and can recognize her flaws. This is not something she would have done in ’08. Voters appreciate the honesty and  . ”"
213310,Who had the Worst Week in Washington?

Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, had blown his   general election head start with a series of   wounds that he seemed unable or unwilling to fix in anything like a timely manner. The Democratic Party had rapidly united behind Hillary Clinton, and polling suggested she had a      edge over Trump. Then this past week happened. It all started Monday when Bill Clinton, for reasons only he will ever know or understand, decided to pop onto the plane of Attorney General Loretta Lynch as everyone cooled their heels on the tarmac at Phoenix’s airport. Everyone involved insisted it was purely a social call, chatting about grandkids and the like. But, the idea of the former president of the United States huddling with the nation’s top cop even as the Justice Department continued to investigate Hillary Clinton’s email setup while she was Secretary of State was problematic    at best. Republicans screamed foul and demanded a special prosecutor be appointed to the case. Lynch, after a week of relentless negative press, announced Friday that she would recuse herself from the matter. Even as her husband was making trouble for her, Hillary Clinton’s      and   current?    rival Bernie Sanders was taking to national television to cast her as something short of a principled liberal. Asked by MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell when he might endorse Clinton, Sanders responded: ”It’s not a question of my endorsement. It’s a question of the American people understanding that Secretary Clinton is prepared to stand with them as they work longer hours for low wages, as they cannot afford health care, as their kids can’t afford to go to college.” Oomph.  Thanks for that one, Bernie! The coup de grace came Saturday when Hillary Clinton submitted to a     interview with the FBI, a final step in that agency’s   investigation into her emails.  While Clinton insisted she was happy to spend the time and simply wanted the truth out, the timing of the interview meant that she will likely be dealing with the fallout from the FBI’s final decision in the matter in the immediate leadup to the Democratic National Convention. Not so good.    Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton met with federal investigators probing her use of a private email account while serving as secretary of state, according to her campaign. (Reuters)   Trump did his best to create diversions to keep the attention off of the Clintons    but this week, not even The Donald could take the spotlight away from Bill and Hillary. And, as is often the case when the country is looking squarely at them, the Clintons had the Worst Week in Washington. Congrats, or something."

Comey dismantled large portions of Clinton’s   story about her private server and what she sent or received on it during a stirring   news conference, after which he took no questions. While Comey exonerated Clinton, legally speaking, he provided huge amounts of fodder that could badly hamstring her in the court of public opinion. Most importantly, Comey said the FBI found 110 emails on Clinton’s server that were classified at the time they were sent or received.

Her political opponents embarrassed themselves with hissy fits and tantrums. And the best campaigner in America fired up her supporters at a nationally televised rally in a crucial swing state. That’s not a good day, it’s a great day. All year, the question of Clinton’s emails had hung over her presidential bid. Despite what her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, told her in their first debate  —   that “the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails”  —   Clinton knew how dangerous the issue was. FBI investigations go wherever the evidence leads; and federal prosecutors have the power to ruin lives, to say nothing of presidential campaigns. In the end, Clinton had to endure harsh words from FBI Director James Comey. She was “extremely careless” in routing sensitive information through a private server, he said. Clinton’s email traffic did, too, include some classified material, despite her carefully parsed denials. But in the end, no “reasonable prosecutor” would bring criminal charges. Comey’s   provided ammunition for Republican attack ads, to be sure. But imagine the alternative scenario in which his decision went the other way. Clinton’s presidential hopes just dodged a mighty big bullet. Republicans reacted with outrage, as could have been expected. They couldn’t accuse Comey of being some sort of Democratic hack  —   he served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration  —   so they resorted to bleats and tweets of general outrage. “The system is rigged,” presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump complained on Twitter. “Secretary Clinton misled the American people when she was confronted with her criminal actions,” House Speaker Paul Ryan hyperventilated. But the rigging was apparently done by a Republican appointee, who made clear that Clinton’s actions were not criminal. Her transgressions might arguably merit administrative sanctions, he said, but not criminal prosecution. The GOP will surely play the issue for all it’s worth, but I’m not sure it’s worth all that much. Outrage may spur some    Republicans to vote for Trump, but most of them were probably headed there anyway. And my guess is that the decision to consider the   matter closed is more likely to help Clinton with independent voters than hurt her. As for the Democratic faithful? Enter President Obama. Appearing with Clinton at a rally in Charlotte, Obama gave such a stemwinder that, well, it almost felt like 2008 again. He obviously relished the chance to go after Trump, ridiculing his lack of coherent policies and his logorrheaic use of social media, and he made a better case for Clinton than she makes for herself. Obama may not convince many Republicans, but he’ll get some independents. Most important, he has a unique and proven ability to inspire Democrats to turn out at the polls. And if Democrats vote in 2008 or 2012 numbers, it’s hard for any Republican to win. Clinton wore a great big smile at the Charlotte rally. She had reason to."
213370,Six things we learned from the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email,Washington Post,Mark Berman,M,2016-07-05,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160707002320/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/07/05/six-things-we-learned-from-the-fbi-investigation-into-hillary-clintons-email/,"FBI Director James B. Comey spoke Tuesday about the bureau’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of emails while she was secretary of state. During his remarks, Comey touched on or revealed six new things about the probe: 1. More than 100 messages across dozens of chains contained classified information when they were sent or received Comey said that investigators looked through tens of thousands of emails and found dozens with information that was deemed classified when they were sent. “From the group of 30, 000 emails returned to the State Department, 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received,” Comey said, according to his prepared remarks. “Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. ” Comey also said that among thousands of emails investigators found that were not turned over by Clinton’s lawyers (more on that in a moment) three of them were classified when they were sent  —   one at the “Secret” level, and two at the “Confidential” level. Though Comey said that “only a very small number” of the emails containing classified information were marked to note that fact, he added that even without the marking, people “who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it. ” In addition, Comey also said another 2, 000 emails investigators reviewed were “ ” to become confidential. That means the information in these emails was not classified when it was sent, but some agency later changed that classification.      [FACT CHECKER: Clinton’s claims about receiving or sending ‘classified material’ on her private   system]   2. “Several thousand   emails” were not among those Clinton returned to the State Department In 2014, lawyers for Clinton gave the State Department more than 30, 000 emails that she said had represented all of her   correspondence during her time as secretary of state. However, Comey said that investigators “discovered several thousand   emails that were not in the group of 30, 000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014. ” Comey outlined how the FBI wound up finding these emails, describing a painstaking process that involved using everything from archived government accounts to looking through different severs. “We found those additional emails in a variety of ways,” Comey said. “Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private email domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived government email accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including   officials at other agencies, people with whom a secretary of state might naturally correspond. This helped us recover   emails that were not among the 30, 000 produced to State. ”    Hillary Clinton last month. (Jonathan  )  Comey said that agents “found no evidence” that any of the emails not among the 30, 000 returned in 2014 were deleted as a way to hide them, but he also said it was not a surprise to learn many emails were found outside of that batch. “Our assessment is that, like many email users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed,” Comey said. “Because she was not using a government account  —   or even a commercial account like Gmail  —   there was no archiving at all of her emails, so it is not surprising that we discovered emails that were not on Secretary Clinton’s system in 2014, when she produced the 30, 000   to the State Department. ”   [“Extremely careless” and seven other big quotes from the FBI’s findings]   3. Clinton sent and received   emails while “in the territory of sophisticated adversaries”  —   and it’s possible, while not proven, her emails were hacked When it came to the question of whether Clinton’s emails were hacked “by hostile actors,” Comey carefully explained why the FBI thinks it is possible this happened even though investigators found no definitive proof. Investigators found no “direct evidence” that Clinton’s email was hacked over the years, Comey said. But he added that given her setup and the people or groups that would try to access her email, it’s “unlikely” the FBI would even be able to see such evidence. Clinton “used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving   emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries,” Comey said. And he said the FBI determined that “hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. ” So while the FBI was not able to find evidence, Comey said that given those factors, “we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account. ”   [FBI recommends no criminal charges in Clinton email probe]   4. Clinton “used several different servers” and “numerous mobile devices” Comey said that it was “a painstaking undertaking” for the bureau to piece together how Clinton used her personal email server, comparing the effort to trying to solve a large jigsaw puzzle. According to Comey, Clinton “used several different servers and administrators of those servers” during her time as secretary of state. She also utilized “numerous mobile devices” to access those servers, he said. When new servers were used, the old ones “were taken out of service, stored and decommissioned in various ways,” Comey said. One server was decommissioned in 2013, he said, and while the email software was removed, the email content remained there, leaving what Comey called “millions of email fragments” in the server’s “slack space. ” (It was in this “slack space” that investigators found some of the emails not among the 30, 000 given to the State Department in 2014, he said.) 5. No intent to violate the law, just “extremely careless” behavior The FBI did not uncover “clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information,” Comey said. But he said investigators determined that Clinton and the others exchanging these messages “were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. ” While Comey ultimately said that the facts uncovered in the investigation did not warrant bringing criminal charges, he still offered sharp criticism for the way the emails were exchanged. Comey said there was evidence that “any reasonable person” in Clinton’s position  —   or the position of the people exchanging the “top secret” emails with her  —   “should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. ” He also said it was concerning that information classified as “secret” was being discussed on an email server without the security found at federal agencies or even “a commercial service like Gmail. ” 6. The FBI says the “security culture of the State Department” is “lacking” Comey said that the State Department’s treatment of security issues was not the focus of the FBI’s investigation here, but he offered sharp words for that agency. “The security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified email systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government,” he said.           The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we’ve learned from them.    Caption   Clinton has come under fire for using a private email address during her time as secretary of state. The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we’ve learned from them.    information in   Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has previously stated that classified information never traveled across her private server. However, the State Department has acknowledged that ”top secret” information was in seven email chains sent or received by her. Richard"
213385,I’m a lawyer specializing in security clearance cases. Hillary Clinton got off easy.,Washington Post,John V. Berry,M,2016-07-07,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160708002327/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/im-a-lawyer-specializing-in-security-clearance-cases-hillary-clinton-got-off-easy/2016/07/07/38b10f3c-4480-11e6-bc99-7d269f8719b1_story.html,"John V. Berry is a Virginia lawyer who specializes in cases involving security clearances.           My legal practice involves representing clients denied or at risk of losing their security clearances. Facing the same set of facts outlined by FBI Director James B. Comey about Hillary Clinton and her aides, my    clients  —   whether an   government contractor or a   federal employee  —   would be in serious jeopardy of losing their security clearances. In fact, I cannot foresee a situation in which an ordinary employee facing such allegations would be able to keep a security clearance with the types of concerns raised in the FBI findings. I write this as a political centrist who tends to like Clinton as a candidate  —   but who is also frustrated by a lack of consistency in the security clearance process and a bias in favor of the  . It is a problem that runs across the political spectrum and is not a Democratic or Republican issue, but rather a “who you are and who you know” issue.  The   the individual, the less likelihood, in most circumstances, of sanctions relating to security issues. In short, current security clearance policy factors in the importance of an individual in deciding whether to revoke a security clearance. Basically,   individuals get treated differently than those at the top of the political food chain facing the same concerns. Perhaps this is human nature, but it is wrong and should be fixed.  Clinton’s use of a personal server for classified government email, without appropriate approvals and security, would normally be treated as a serious security violation. Another security violation would be the storage and transmission of classified materials using personal (nongovernmental) means off site. Everyone involved in the setting up of the server, the transmission or storage of such information or knowledge of same would have had separate security obligations to follow regarding the rules for protecting classified information. Finally, providing classified information to defense lawyers who are not cleared to review such documents (as was alleged to have occurred) could also constitute a security violation for a regular employee.  Normally, the types of security concerns listed above would be considered significant clearance violations under Guideline K (Handling Protection Information) and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) of the rules governing security clearances as referenced in State Department regulations.  Consider the government contractor who comes to my office to see me based on allegations that she accidentally took home a personal hard drive containing   classified information. Even if the information at issue was not important, it is not uncommon for such an individual to lose her security clearance, be placed on leave and then terminated. This outcome varies, based on the facts of an individual case, but the risk is significant. Other common clearance cases involve government contractors or federal employees who accidentally email classified information to their homes and then face the serious risk of losing their security clearances. Essentially, these individuals  —   and I have seen many over the years  —   go from a job making $150, 000 a year to trying to find any job that will take them. Most of these individuals have spent their entire careers in cleared positions, so they have little transferrable experience when they lose their clearance, which leads to the end of their existing career.       Another problem is that there is no single agency that oversees the security clearance process for all individuals. Instead, because each federal agency adjudicates its own security clearances, there can be significant disparity in outcomes between agencies. Security concerns at one agency, say, the Defense Department, may be resolved favorably and a person granted clearance, but the same person presenting the same security concerns may be denied clearance at the FBI. Having so many agencies with duplicative processes also opens the door for more manipulation of individual outcomes.  Security clearances are ultimately governed by presidential executive order, which means that a president can decide who does and doesn’t get a security clearance, and can change the rules. Thus, as a practical matter, a President Clinton would not face a problem obtaining access to classified information, and she could overrule any recommendations denying clearances to her trusted aides. The real issue is fairness. Either we treat everybody the same with respect to classified information or we do not. The next president should overhaul the system so that there is consistency for all clearance holders, whatever their station in life.    Read more here:   Marc A.

213437,"In email probe, echoes of another time prosecutors weighed charging Hillary Clinton with a crime",Washington Post,Rosalind S. Helderman,F,2016-07-09,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160710001100/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-email-probe-echoes-of-another-time-prosecutors-weighed-charging-hillary-clinton-with-a-crime/2016/07/09/5bbeb7c8-4498-11e6-88d0-6adee48be8bc_story.html,"Over the course of 16 hours, prosecutors and FBI agents agonized over whether to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime. In the end, after weighing every ounce of evidence, examining piles of documents and gaming out whether a jury would ever convict her, the group made its wrenching decision: no charges. Nearly 20 years before FBI Director James B. Comey declared that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a criminal case against Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, Clinton narrowly escaped a similar legal peril amid the Whitewater investigation that engulfed much of her husband’s time as president. While history remembers the 1990s probe led by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr for its pursuit of President Bill Clinton over the possibility he had lied under oath about his relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky, internal documents from the inquiry show how close prosecutors came to filing charges at that time against Hillary Clinton. They even drew up a draft indictment for Clinton, which has never been made public.  [Office of Independent Counsel memos on Hillary Clinton]  As in the email controversy of today, Clinton’s honesty was a central question facing investigators in 1998 as they weighed whether what they saw as shifting stories from Clinton amounted to an attempt to cover up misconduct. Like the events of today, Clinton was interviewed for hours by authorities. Unlike the email inquiry, in which Comey said Clinton’s status as a presidential candidate had no effect on the decision not to charge her, documents from the 1990s show how prosecutors weighed whether Clinton’s political popularity would make her more difficult to convict.     Nannygate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Filegate: it’s tough to remember all the scandals that plagued   Bill and Hillary Clinton through the ’90s. For millennials     here’s what you missed. For everyone else, here’s a refresher. (Sarah Parnass, Adriana   Washington Post)    At issue then was legal work Clinton had performed in the 1980s while an attorney at Little Rock’s Rose Law Firm on behalf of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, which was owned by a business partner of the Clintons who was later convicted of fraud in connection with bad loans made by the thrift. Clinton said that her legal work was minimal and that she was unaware of the wrongdoing at Madison Guaranty. The episode serves as a reminder of how long Clinton has faced scrutiny about her ethics and judgment, dating even to her days in the East Wing. It helps explain why public questions about her trustworthiness have been so difficult for her to overcome, as well as why she and her supporters have long felt targeted by their political opponents. The records of prosecutors’ 1998 deliberations were obtained by The Washington Post from the National Archives through a Freedom of Information Act request. The Archives declined to release copies of the draft indictment to The Post, saying that access to the document is “restricted. ” Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group, has sued the Archives, seeking release of the indictment draft. The released records include a memo, written by Starr’s team, summarizing the evidence against Clinton. The prosecutors noted that she made numerous sworn statements between January 1994 and February 1996 that they thought “reflected and embodied materially inaccurate stories. ” “The question, generally, is not whether the statements are inaccurate, but whether they are willfully so,” the prosecutors continued. The records show the prosecutors had doubts about whether potential jurors would be swayed by a largely circumstantial case, particularly given Clinton’s stature as first lady. Prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig laid out the odds for various outcomes in a memo to colleagues. He predicted a 2 percent chance that a judge would toss the case, then continued: “18 percent = Acquittal; 70 percent = Hung Jury; 10 percent = Conviction. ”    In this excerpt from a 1998 Office of the Independent Counsel memo, prosecutors outline the chance that they would get a conviction of Hillary vs. a hung jury or acquittal. (The Washington Post)  “Not enough in my view,” he wrote. In an interview, Rosenzweig said he had reflected on that    decision while listening to Comey’s remarks last week. He said Comey’s decision was “very reminiscent” of the challenge that faced the Office of Independent Counsel team. Rosenzweig said he had concluded in 1998 that seating a jury untainted by political bias was going to be so difficult as to make the chances for a conviction too low to proceed ethically with the case. “This case was, for me, decided on factors external to guilt or innocence,” he said. “I think this case would have had a great chance of a sustained conviction if presented to 12 random people, about someone other than Mrs. Clinton. But that’s an impossible hypothetical. ” A spokesman for Clinton, Brian Fallon, played down parallels between how prosecutors handled the   email inquiry and the   investigation in the 1990s. “Then, as now, investigators were facing heavy outside pressure to generate a politically motivated prosecution,” Fallon said. “The difference is, in the case of the secretary’s emails, the Justice Department has resisted those partisan pressures, with career officials unanimously recommending that no case be brought. In the Whitewater investigation, which was not headed by career officials, the political forces exerted sufficient pressure to produce a bogus draft indictment  —   until, that is, the independent counsel’s office was forced to relent in the face of the facts and consign that draft document to the dustbin of history. ” The drama of the 1998 decision was laid out in the 2010 book “The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr,” a definitive account of the Clinton impeachment saga by law professor Ken Gormley, who interviewed nearly all of the key players. Hillary Clinton did not speak with him. Gormley wrote that prosecutors and FBI agents met to consider the matter at 8 a. m. on Monday, April 27, 1998, in a session that lasted until nearly midnight. The prosecutor who had led a   investigation of Hillary Clinton’s activities with the Rose Law Firm spent hours laying out for his colleagues the case that she had had more involvement in work that had facilitated illicit activity for Madison Guaranty and a troubled real estate project called Castle Grande than she had acknowledged.    The eyes of the news media are on Hillary Clinton as she arrives to testify before the Whitewater grand jury in 1996. (James M.   Washington Post)  Prosecutors discussed one of the more dramatic moments of the Whitewater era: the unexpected discovery of billing records from Clinton’s time as an attorney in a storage room on the third floor of the White House residence . The records had been missing for two years, and White House aides had said they could not be located, even after an exhaustive search, in response to a subpoena. The records had been found in 1996 by Hillary Clinton’s executive assistant, on a table in a room adjacent to Clinton’s office. Clinton had told Barbara Walters in a televised interview that she was glad the records had surfaced, and she chalked their disappearance up to a White House crammed with millions of pages of disorganized documents. “You know, a month ago, people were jumping up and down because the billing records were lost and they thought somebody might have destroyed them. Now the records are found, and they’re jumping up and down,” Clinton said. Starr’s team suspected that Clinton might have orchestrated the mysterious reappearance of the documents. “There is a circumstantial case that the records were left on the table by Hillary Clinton,” the prosecutors wrote. The memo described how the lawyers had interviewed everyone else with access to the room where the records were found, then concluded: “She is the only individual in the White House who had a significant interest in them. ” Later in 1998, Starr told Congress that the discovery of the billing records was a “mystery” that his investigators had been unable to solve. In her 2003 memoir “Living History,” Clinton rejected the allegation that she had tried to hide the records. She wrote that she thought the documents had been lost until her assistant found them. “I certainly had no reason to conceal them and regretted that they had not been found earlier,” Clinton wrote. Starr’s team also considered how Clinton probably would have had numerous advantages if a trial took place, as expected, in Arkansas or Washington, where jurors were likely to be supportive of the first lady. Ultimately, instead of charging Hillary Clinton, the prosecutors decided to focus their energies on the Lewinsky issue. Gormley, who is now president of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, said his exhaustive review of the case led him to believe there was not a compelling case to indict Hillary Clinton. He said the April 1998 meeting occurred at a time when the investigation was otherwise stymied and that prosecutors, eager to make a case, considered the Hillary Clinton indictment as one of several strategies to potentially push it forward. “I got the sense that Starr prosecutors, generally, recognized there wasn’t sufficient evidence,” he said. Rosenzweig, who is now a principal at a homeland security consulting company, said he continued to believe the group made the right decision not to seek an indictment. Still, he said he could remember leaving the   meeting “drained, disappointed, dismayed” that such a meticulous and lengthy part of the investigation had come to nothing.    An excerpt from a 1998 Office of the Independent Counsel memo showing some of the evidence investigators had gathered against Clinton, as well as the considerations that went into a decision not to file criminal charges against her. (The Washington Post)  Today, many Republicans are expressing similar frustrations about the FBI’s inquiry into Clinton’s email practices. Comey has said he concluded that Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified material but that there was no evidence she had broken the law by intentionally mishandling it. He insisted that her status as a famous former secretary of state, senator and first lady played no role in the decision.  [FBI recommends no criminal charges in Clinton email probe]  That differs from the Starr prosecutors, who specifically weighed how her celebrity and political popularity might affect the jury in a criminal trial, Rosenzweig said. He said he does not think that Clinton personally has been afforded special treatment, now or in the 1990s  —   a charge often leveled by Republicans. But he said he thinks her case illustrates the way elites are generally treated differently in the justice system. “Our justice system is great  —   but it is imperfect,” he said. In an interview, Gormley said Comey’s decision reminded him of a different episode in the Whitewater saga: the moment in 1992, not long before the presidential election, when   U. S. Attorney Charles Banks refused to reopen an Arkansas investigation that might implicate the Clintons. Banks told Gormley he had faced pressure from officials at a federal agency to do so but he refused, thinking the evidence did not warrant a probe, even though he would have benefited from the reelection of President George H. W. Bush, a Republican. “Banks was very sensitive to the fact that if he were to get involved in this case again, with the presidential election looming so close, that would undermine the trust of the American public in our system of justice,” Gormley said of Banks. “Comey reminded me of that unsung hero. ”"
213493,56 percent of Americans disapprove of FBI decision to exonerate Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Scott Clement,M,2016-07-11,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160712002005/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/11/poll-most-disapprove-of-fbi-decision-to-exonerate-clinton/,"A majority of Americans reject the FBI’s recommendation against charging Hillary Clinton with a crime for her State Department   practices and say the issue raises concerns about how she might perform her presidential duties, according to a new Washington   News poll. Six in 10 voters say the outcome will have no impact on their vote this November, even as those who do largely say it discourages them from backing the presumptive Democratic nominee. Last week’s decision by FBI Director James B. Comey resulted in the Justice Department’s decision that Clinton would not face criminal prosecution which could have derailed her presidential bid. But Comey’s sharp critique of Clinton’s email practices and systematic dismantling of her public defenses stocked critics with fresh ammunition for the general election campaign.   The   poll found 56 percent disapprove of Comey’s recommendation against charging Clinton while 35 percent approve. The survey mentioned Comey’s reasoning that Clinton did not have criminal intent but that he found her actions were extremely careless handling  . Roughly 6 in 10 independents disapprove of the recommendation against charges (59 percent) rising to nearly 9 in 10 Republicans (88 percent) and falling to 31 percent of Democrats. While Clinton has defended her practice as a matter of personal convenience similar to her predecessors, 57 percent in the poll say the issue worries them about how she might handle responsibilities if elected president, while 39 percent say it’s not related to how she would perform as president. Over 4 in 10 say they are ”very worried” about the issue’s implications for Clinton’s performance as president.   The results resemble public opinion throughout the past year showing a majority of the public criticizing her answers to questions about the issue  —   a   poll before the federal probe ended found 56 percent disapproving of her response. One key factor behind the negative ratings is a substantial level of criticism for Clinton among fellow partisans and   groups. Over 3 in 10 Democrats disapprove of Director Comey’s recommendation against charges for Clinton (31 percent) and the same percentage says the issue makes them worry about Clinton’s presidential responsibility. Over 4 in 10 liberals say the issue raises concerns about how Clinton might handle responsibilities as president, as do 36 percent of   Americans and 56 percent of those under age 40.   Registered voters who oppose the decision to forego criminal charges are nonetheless split on whether the outcome makes them less likely to vote Clinton in November  —   47 percent say it makes no difference in their vote while 45 percent say they’re less likely to support her (8 percent say they’re more likely to do so). Among all voters, 60 percent say the outcome makes no difference in their vote choice, including an identical share of political independents. Republican voters are the most likely to say the outcome discourages them to support Clinton  —   49 percent  —   though the vast majority of this group was already strongly opposed to her candidacy before the FBI’s announcement.   The   poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday among a random national sample of 519 adults reached on cellular and landline phones. The margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 5 percentage points. Emily Guskin contributed to this report."
213494,Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton: ‘She’s highly overrated in the brains department’,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-07-11,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160712002005/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/11/donald-trump-on-hillary-clinton-shes-highly-overrated-in-the-brains-department/,"Donald Trump cast the presidential race as a sort of athletic contest in a Monday interview with The Fix, insisting he has a history of performing under pressure while Hillary Clinton, his   Democratic opponent, withers under that sort of scrutiny. ”She is highly overrated in the brains department,” Trump said of Clinton. ”She is really bad at reacting under pressure.” Of himself, Trump said ”I was always a good athlete,” adding: ”Under pressure, some good athletes become bad athletes”    referring to Clinton. Trump cast Clinton’s track record in public office as evidence of her inability to handle the pressures of the spotlight. ”Whether it was the war or the emails got worse and worse and worse,” he said. On the email front at least, Trump appears to be on solid ground. New polling from The Washington   News shows that 56 percent of Americans said they were dissatisfied with the decision by the FBI to not recommend an indictment of Clinton in the wake of the organization’s investigation.   But Trump could get into politically dicey territory by suggesting that Clinton isn’t smart enough to be president or not able to perform when the bright lights are on her. Six in 10 registered voters in the June   poll said that Clinton is ”qualified” to be president. Just more than one in three (36 percent) voters said the same of Trump.     Then there are Trump’s broader problems with female voters. Trump took only 34 percent of the female vote in the Post’s June survey    well below Mitt Romney’s 44 percent and John McCain’s 43 percent among women in 2012 and 2008, respectively. Given all of that, casting doubt on Clinton’s brain power would seem to be a strategic error by Trump."
213685,The continuing political decline of Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-07-18,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160719000653/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/18/the-continuing-political-decline-of-hillary-clinton/,"If it weren’t for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton would be the most disliked   presidential nominee in recent American history. That qualifier, of course, is important here. Clinton doesn’t need to be liked; she needs to be liked slightly more than Trump in what will very likely boil down to a   race. But it’s hard to overstate just how bad Clinton’s numbers are. And a new Washington   News poll is the latest to suggest they just keep getting worse  —   so much so that they are in some ways about as bad as Trump’s. The poll shows 54 percent of all Americans have an unfavorable view of Clinton and 44 percent have a ”strongly unfavorable” view of her. When you boil it down just to registered voters, those numbers tick up to 57 percent and 47 percent, respectively. Either way you slice it, Clinton’s image is as bad or worse than it has ever been. Below is the trendline on her ”strongly unfavorable” number among all Americans. That 44 percent figure is an   high  —   as is the 47 percent figure among registered voters.   In a campaign between two candidates neither of whom a quarter of Americans say they like, it seems apparent this race will come down to whom they dislike less and whom they trust to be president  —   despite their personal distaste. But while many Americans will basically have to vote for someone they dislike, there are degrees of dislike. And voting for someone you strongly dislike is a much tougher haul. Which brings us to this: Nearly half of registered voters strongly dislike Hillary Clinton, and nearly half of registered voters strongly dislike Donald Trump. As we noted for Clinton, it’s 47 percent. For Trump, it’s 49 percent. A virtual tie. That suggests getting majority support  —   or close to it  —   as most presidential elections have required will be a struggle for both   candidates this year. This is not the first poll to suggest Clinton is hitting a new low. Recent polls have shown her unfavorable rating as high as 60 percent. Real Clear Politics’ average of recent polls shows her unfavorable at 56. 2 percent. For Trump, it’s at 60. 1 percent. But while Trump has certainly struggled, he seems to have leveled off and maybe even improved a bit in recent months.     Clinton, meanwhile, is trending worse and worse and flirting with Trumpian levels of negative feelings.     There was a time in which Trump was clearly on worse footing with his image than Clinton; back in May, 7 in 10 Americans disliked Trump, while 55 percent disliked Clinton  —   a   gap. That is no longer clearly the case, with the   poll showing just a five point gap among registered voters. And it has to test our assumptions of how much of a favorite Clinton is to become the next president. Running for president, of course, isn’t completely a popularity contest. It helps to be liked, but other things factor in, like a candidate’s ability to create change and a candidate’s readiness for the job. On the former measure, Trump clearly leads; on the latter, Clinton clearly does. In fact, the   poll shows 58 percent of registered voters say Trump isn’t qualified to be president, but just 42 percent say the same of Clinton. A relatively strong majority  —   56 percent  —   says Clinton is qualified. That’s a significant gap, and it suggests that if the 2016 election comes down to who appears more presidential, Clinton very likely wins. But if voters are looking for change and to shake up the system, that’s where Trump excels. When it comes to who could bring the ”needed change to Washington,” Trump leads by 11 points,  . Again, if it’s a change election, Trump probably wins, but if voters are more concerned about 3 a. m. phone calls and presidentiality (presidentialness?) it’s probably Clinton. What’s clear from the numbers above, though, is that Clinton can’t count on a popularity edge. Her email problems  —   and other problems  —   have clearly taken a major toll on her image. More than 7 in 10 Americans say Clinton is too willing to bend the rules. And to the extent elections are popularity contests  —   which they often have been  —   that’s significant. Then again, we haven’t seen an election with two politicians who are so unpopular. So consider this the kind of uncharted territory that should give the Clinton campaign heartburn.     Save Save"
213734,How Hillary Clinton can win over horrified Republicans,Washington Post,Jennifer Rubin,F,2016-07-20,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160721002550/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/07/20/how-hillary-clinton-can-win-over-horrified-republicans/,"With the official nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican Party’s presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has the opponent of her dreams  —   someone whose character, preparation and views are so defective as to make last night’s roll call a devastating moment in the lives of many Republicans. The GOP has had magnificent nominees (Abraham Lincoln) and likable nominees (Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower). It’s had admirable nominees who lost (Mitt Romney) and flawed nominees who won (Richard Nixon). It has never  —   and we certainly include Barry Goldwater  —   had a nominee who embarrasses and disgusts a significant number of people in his own party. How does Clinton, without endangering support in her own ranks, reach out to Republicans to secure her win? Here are five steps she can take: 1. Resist the urge to defame the entire party. A majority of the GOP primary electorate did not vote for Trump, and many who did not participate in the primaries will not vote for him. It is to these Republicans that Clinton should appeal. 2. Paint the picture. As horrifying as it might seem, Clinton should be spelling out the potential ramifications of a Trump presidency. One day he writes off the Baltic States in a fit of pique, prompting Vladimir Putin to  strike while the iron is hot. Trump does not believe the United States can default on the debt so he does just that in refusing to accept a reasonable budget (or continuing resolution) crafted by members of both parties. He digs in his heels and decides he need not abide by a Supreme Court ruling invalidating parts of his wacky immigration plan. These are not fantastical scenarios; they are entirely predictable.    At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, vendors are selling everything from ”Hillary for Prison”   to Donald Trump whoopee cushions. (Jorge   Washington Post)   3. Commit herself to bipartisanship in foreign policy. We have argued that without President Obama, there is a great deal more bipartisan agreement on Russia, the Islamic State, Iran, China, NATO and other topics. Clinton can pledge to include in significant policy positions some of the   voices with whom she sees eye to eye on any number of topics. She can say it is time to stop relitigating the Iraq War and work on eradicating the Islamic State and ensuring a stable Middle East. She can be gracious toward respected Republicans (e. g. Sen. John McCain). 4. She can defend George W. Bush now and then  —   against Trump. Bush’s   campaign has saved millions of lives in Africa. He championed No Child Left Behind. He forcefully derided   bias. It’s actually an old trick to praise past Republicans as a means of criticizing active ones, but the tactic here is especially effective given how depressed Republicans are about the nominee this time around. 5. Elevate the qualities Trump lacks; support the values he derides. Trump lacks empathy, intellectual curiosity, patience and tolerance  —   some of the critical traits of successful presidents. He disdains “losers,” reveres power and feigns religiosity. These deficiencies go far beyond politics. Most ordinary Americans do not share these glaring defects and feel queasy about a president who does. Simply said, Americans are better than this. (We hope.) Clinton will no doubt do some small things well. She’ll have a long list of Republican supporters. She’ll run a real campaign in 50 states, refusing to write off states Democrats haven’t won recently (as she hopes Trump wastes time and money in New York and California). But what she really needs to do is demonstrate a largeness of spirit, something Trump is incapable of doing."
213748,"Hillary Clinton, Saul Alinsky and Lucifer, explained",Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-07-20,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160721002550/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/20/hillary-clinton-saul-alinsky-and-lucifer-explained/,"This post has been updated with details about how Clinton decided to write a thesis about Saul Alinsky. Saul Alinsky and Lucifer made appearances at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night. It’s not clear who was supposed to be scarier. In his   speech, Ben Carson offered his own case against Hillary Clinton. It had a lot to do with tying her to Alinsky  —   and, by extension, the devil. Here’s what he said: Now, one of the things that I have learned about Hillary Clinton is that one of her heroes, her mentors was Saul Alinsky. And her senior thesis was about Saul Alinsky. This was someone that she greatly admired and that affected all of her philosophies subsequently. Now, interestingly enough, let me tell you something about Saul Alinsky. He wrote a book called, ”Rules for Radicals.” On the dedication page it acknowledges Lucifer, the original radical who gained his own kingdom. . .. This is a nation where every coin in our pocket, and every bill in our wallet says, ”In God We Trust.” So, are we willing to elect someone as president who has as their role model somebody who acknowledges Lucifer? Think about that. This isn’t quite Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, but it’s the same concept. Clinton is bad, Carson argues, because one of ”her heroes, her mentors” is Alinsky  —   a man who ”acknowledges Lucifer.” There’s a lot to unpack here. First, it is true that, in the front of his book, Alinsky does acknowledge Lucifer in what could be read as a positive way: Lest we forget at least an    acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins  —   or which is which) the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom  —   Lucifer. The paragraph is directly attributed to Alinsky. Carson’s implication seems to be that Alinsky speaks favorably about the devil and that makes him toxic for Clinton. Alinsky was a   radical, and this is indeed a provocative statement. It also appears to be something of a  ; while Alinsky’s book is all about ”Rules for Radicals,” he does not go on to further discuss this particular radical  —   Lucifer  —   and the example he might provide for other radicals. Alinsky did offer other provocative comments that have led to of accusations of sympathy for the devil, so to speak. In a 1972 Playboy interview, he said that while he identifies as Jewish, he would choose to go to Hell. ”Hell would be heaven for me,” because it was full of ”” he said. ”They’re my kind of people.” These passages form the basis for accusations that Alinsky was   or even satanic. But then we get to the next logical step Carson asks us to take  —   tying Clinton tightly to Alinsky. If this all sounds familiar, it’s because four years ago, it was the other recent Democratic presidential nominee, Barack Obama, who was getting this treatment. Newt Gingrich during his 2012 campaign was fond of referring to Obama as a ”Saul Alinsky radical.” (Click that link if you still don’t know who Alinsky is.) Back in 2008, Rudy Giuliani did it too. Tying Clinton to Alinsky is pretty easy; she wrote her undergraduate thesis at Wellesley College about him and even interviewed him. As the New York Times’s Mark Leibovich explained after reviewing the thesis in 2007: Ms. Rodham endorsed Mr. Alinsky’s central critique of government antipoverty programs  —   that they tended to be too   and removed from the wishes of individuals. But the student leader split with Mr. Alinsky over a central point. He vowed to ‘rub raw the sores of discontent’ and compel action through agitation. This, she believed, ran counter to the notion of change within the system. Carson describes Alinsky as one of Clinton’s ”heroes” and ”mentors.” Those terms are highly debatable, but Clinton was close enough to Alinsky that, in her 2003 book, ”Living History,” she mentioned turning down the offer to work with him after college. I agreed with some of Alinsky’s ideas, particularly the value of empowering people to help themselves. But we had a fundamental disagreement. He believed you could change the system only from the outside. I didn’t. Later, he offered me the chance to work with him when I graduated from college, and he was disappointed that I decided instead to go to law school. Alinsky said I would be wasting my time, but my decision was an expression of my belief that the system could be changed from within. Clinton also brought Alinsky to Wellesley in 1969 to deliver a speech. And in her thesis, she refers to his ”compelling personality” and “his exceptional charm,” according the NBC’s Bill Dedman, who also read the thesis in 2007. But there’s little evidence that Clinton was particularly close to the man. And indeed, her decision to write a thesis involving Alinsky wasn’t her idea, her thesis adviser recently told The Washington Post. Alan Schechter, who is now an emeritus professor at Wellesley in addition to a donor who has also campaigned for Clinton, was a professor of political science, just 10 years older than Clinton and her classmates, with an   office policy that students would regularly take advantage of. Schechter, who said he viewed one of his functions as taking a students’ inchoate ideas and helping them craft a researchable project, said he advised Clinton to make a comparison between a   government   approach and a   model and focus it in Chicago, where Alinsky, whom she had met the previous year, was working on   organization. He said Clinton approached it pragmatically and not from a   perspective. ”The thesis was entirely pragmatic,” Schechter said. ”Its conclusions were extremely pragmatic    ’This doesn’t work,’ ’that doesn’t work,’ ’this has the only hope of partial benefit. ’”    Hillary Clinton’s thesis on Saul Alinsky (Marilyn   Washington Post)  He recalled her telling him the following spring that Alinsky had offered her a job, but she had concluded, he said, that his method wouldn’t have a major impact on poverty and that it would lose its impact on the political leaders of the community. She had come to see Alinsky as a     Schechter argued. Which brings us back to Carson. This is Political Attack 101  —   finding an associate of your opponent who has done objectionable or controversial things and tying your opponent as closely to them and their deeds as possible. For Obama, it was Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright. The implication is that your opponent believes these same controversial things and is guilty by association. It remains to be seen whether Alinsky and even Lucifer will be a significant part of the   and Donald   case made against Clinton moving forward. Carson has a tendency to make analogies and say things that other Republicans won’t. In this campaign, it’s hard to rule anything out. Frances Stead Sellers contributed to this post.

Scribner. 567 pp. $18 HARD CHOICES by Hillary Rodham Clinton. Scribner. 535 pp. $18 While Donald Trump claims to be our voice, Hillary Clinton forever struggles to find hers. Her speech Thursday at the Democratic National Convention will afford her yet another chance to argue her case, to explain why she’s the best person for the presidency. For Clinton, whom we’ve known so well and so long, that’s a challenge. Familiarity affords obvious strengths, but so far in this campaign, it often has posed a hindrance, with the proportion of Americans viewing Clinton unfavorably creeping up as the race has worn on. The candidate who discovered her own voice in a small New Hampshire port town eight years ago now faces an electorate that has trouble trusting what she says. “I have work to do on this point,” she admitted recently. That has been the work of a lifetime for Clinton, not only as a first lady, senator, presidential candidate and secretary of state, but as an author as well. If “It Takes a Village” (1996) was a statement of Clinton’s values, then her two memoirs, “Living History” (2003) and “Hard Choices” (2014) are her portrayal of those values in action. The memoirs show how Clinton perceives her life and record, and how she wants us to see them, too. All memoir is, to some extent, propaganda, and the memoirs of striving politicians may be the most agitprop of all. Even so, the Hillary Clinton who emerges from these   pages of autobiography is revealing in ways that she never will be in political ads, party platforms, or   Philadelphia infomercials. In her writing, she is torn over her generational and gender symbolism, incapable of separating the personal from the political, and loath to concede anything beyond tactical errors. She is trapped in what she calls “derivative” subordinate roles under more politically powerful men, yet finds ways to thrive in them. She is ever aware of the daggers surrounding her, but still careless in exposing herself to the blades. She recognizes the risks inherent in the most potent relationship of her life, yet is unwilling to relinquish it. And she is a talented writer and expansive thinker whose writing and thinking grow more cautious as the prize of the presidency draws nearer. “Living History” spans Clinton’s life from childhood through her election as the junior senator from New York in 2000. “Hard Choices” chronicles her experiences as President Obama’s secretary of state. “Hard Choices” is about her ability, “Living History” is about her humanity. Clinton may be tempted to stress the former, to premise her election on expertise and predictability, especially when her Republican rival sells only fear and division. Yet in reading her memoirs, that is the   version of the candidate. “Living History” is riskier, more vulnerable, more real, especially read now, in an era when most campaigns have grown less so. Competence and experience have always been Clinton’s calling card, but they’ve not sufficed. For the remainder of this campaign, her task, her hardest choice, will be to reveal the humanity behind the capability, the person inside the politician. *** “While Bill talked about social change, I embodied it. ” That’s how Clinton describes her impact on her husband’s 1992 presidential campaign, when Bill’s suggestion that Americans would get “two for one” and Hillary’s response to questions about her legal career  —   “I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas”  —   became forever embedded in Clinton lore, eliciting admiration, skepticism and sexism in equal measure. “I had been turned into a symbol for women of my generation,” she concludes, reliving the controversies over her professional background and policy ambitions vs. the traditional duties of a political spouse. “In this era of changing gender roles, I was America’s Exhibit A. ”     . Hillary Rodham Clinton holds up “Living History” at a 2003 book signing in Auburn Hills, Mich. (AP   Pugliano)  Yet if the generational symbolism felt imposed during the race, it was a burden she was happy to shoulder on other occasions. Her 1969 commencement speech at Wellesley College, the one that made her a national figure long before anyone heard of a certain William Jefferson Clinton, was, she explains, a reflection of the aspirations of Clinton and her classmates, “women and Americans whose lives would exemplify the changes and choices facing our generation. ” At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, she writes, the young Clinton and Gore families waving at Madison Square Garden represented “a new generation’s turn to lead. ” And when working with Bill on a major   speech early in his presidency, she reminded him that reform was “our generation’s chance to answer a call on behalf of future generations. ” Clinton is predisposed to see herself in such   terms. In “Hard Choices,” she recalls considering the legacies of her most notable predecessors as secretary of state  —   Thomas Jefferson, George C. Marshall, Dean Acheson  —   and envisioning how she would remake the role. “I believe, with all of my heart, that this is a new era for America,” she told her cheering new colleagues on her first day on the job. Even when Clinton’s memoirs revel in life, family and friendship, she invariably circles back to politics. After Chelsea was born and Hillary took four months off from her Little Rock law firm, she and Bill “emerged from our experience committed to ensuring that all parents have the option to stay home with their newborn children. ” When, early in Bill’s presidency, her father is dying and Hillary huddles with her family in his hospital room, “succumbing to the hypnotic whir and click of the respirator,” she makes time to talk with doctors, nurses and administrators about   reform, and the conversations reinforced “the importance of improving our system. ” While Clinton was attending the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway, she recalls, Prime Minister Gro Brundtland asked her about the proposed   bill, which instantly made her “a friend for life. ” Yes, chronic   is an occupational hazard of reading Clinton’s memoirs. Still, the deeper you go, the more you realize that she isn’t just another politician mining life experiences for cheap talking points. This is really what it’s like to walk around inside her head. Life and politics and policy are never separate  —   and nowhere is this clearer than in her relationship with the 42nd president. [This is the closest thing we’ll ever have to a Hillary Clinton political manifesto] “Living History” shows Bill and Hillary checking each other out at the Yale Law Library, details their work on the 1972 McGovern campaign and chronicles Bill’s numerous proposals before she agrees to marry him. “When we first met as students, I loved watching him turn the pages of a book,” Clinton writes, capturing the almost sensual intellectualism with which she regards him. But her doubts about him were prescient. “I thought of him as a force of nature,” she explains, “and wondered whether I’d be up to the task of living through his seasons. ” Winter arrived in the second term, and “Living History” describes Hillary’s reaction to the Monica Lewinsky revelations. “I could hardly breathe. Gulping for air, I started crying and yelling at him,” she writes. She details the distance, anger and loneliness as the scandal played out, but more instructive is her explanation for how and why they reconciled. “As his wife, I wanted to wring Bill’s neck,” Clinton explains. “But he was not only my husband, he was also my President, and I thought that, in spite of everything, Bill led America and the world in a way that I continued to support. ” All those who speculate that the Clintons share a marriage of political convenience  —   that they’ve reached an “arrangement,” as Steve Kroft suggested in a “60 Minutes” interview  —   miss the point. In her telling, there is no   between the personal and the political; they are entirely fused. Later, when Hillary considers a run for a U. S. Senate seat out of New York, political strategizing brings the couple together. “One benefit of my   process was that Bill and I were talking again about matters other than the future of our relationship. Over time, we both began to relax. ” Clinton, of course, regarded the investigations of the administration as fundamentally unfair, part of the infamous “vast   conspiracy” that she complained about in 1998. “I viewed the independent counsel’s assault on the Presidency as an ever escalating political war,” she writes, and in that war, she fought alongside Bill, never against him. The chapter titles of “Living History” list the battles: Vince Foster. Whitewater. Independent Counsel. Impeachment. Looking back on the era, when even minor controversies exploded into lengthy investigations and endless press leaks, it astonishes that Hillary Clinton, years later, would risk using a private email server to communicate official State Department business  —   and then would take so long to admit her mistake. Yet, this reluctance to admit error looms over the Clinton memoirs. “There are always choices we regret, consequences we do not foresee, and alternate paths we wish we had taken,” she writes in “Hard Choices,” but her regrets are often situational, or poorly disguised attacks on political enemies. On the failure of the Clintons’   initiative, she suggests that they tried to move “too quickly”  —   so zealous in helping the American people!  —   and concludes that she and Bill failed to promote reform “with enough clarity and simplicity to rouse public support or to motivate Congress to act in the face of     opponents. ” Essentially, a PR  . Clinton also regrets how she and Bill succumbed to pressure from opponents, as well as White House political operatives, to request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Whitewater. “With the wisdom of hindsight, I wish I had fought harder and not let myself be persuaded to take the path of least resistance,” she writes. Similarly, not settling the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton early on was “the second biggest tactical mistake made in handling the barrage of investigations and lawsuits. ”    HiIlary Rodham at a 2014 signing event for “Hard Choices” at a New York bookstore. (AP   Matthews)  In “Hard Choices,” Clinton calls her 2002 Senate vote authorizing military action in Iraq a “mistake” but then explains why she long resisted calling it so. “It wasn’t because of political expediency,” she insists. “After all, primary voters and the press were clamoring for me to say that word. When I voted to authorize force in 2002, I said that it was ‘probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make.’ I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. ” Such mea culpas are a rarity in “Hard Choices,” which reads like 500 pages worth of résumé bullet points, an affirmation of expertise. Seemingly every trip, however inconsequential, is dutifully detailed, and Clinton offers generic, cliched descriptions of her destinations. We learn that China is a country “full of contradictions,” that the Obama administration came to office “during a perilous time in the Middle East” and that “coaxing the Israelis and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table was not going to be easy. ” Also, Benjamin Netanyahu is a “complicated figure,” while Vladi mir Putin is “  and autocratic. ” And Clinton quotes Haitian President René Préval begging a State Department aide for help after the country’s massive 2010 earthquake: “I need Hillary. I need her. And no one else. ” [How Clinton and Obama tried to run the world  —   while trying to manage each other] Clinton has a weakness for foreign policy buzzwords (she relies on “smart power”; Syria poses a “wicked problem”) and local proverbs (“When it rains, collect water,” they say in Burma, apparently). She stresses her foresight and foreign policy savvy, suggesting that she saw the Arab Spring coming and anticipated its disheartening consequences. In a visit with activists in Egypt shortly after the fall of dictator Hosni Mubarak, “I came away worried that they would end up handing the country to the Muslim Brotherhood or the military by default, which in the end is exactly what happened. ” Journalistic accounts have emphasized how tightly the Obama White House controls foreign policy, leaving the State Department far from the action at times. Clinton is careful to avoid such complaints, going out of her way to emphasize how closely she and President Obama worked, invariably characterizing theirs as a partnership, not a rivalry, let alone a   relationship. This is Clinton’s time on the world stage, after all, and it grates to be a supporting actor. “I was at the White House more than seven hundred times during my four years,” she writes, protesting a bit too much. “After losing the election, I never expected to spend so much time there. ” *** Now, once again, Clinton seeks to take up permanent residence there. Unlike in her 2008 campaign, when she largely resisted playing up the historic appeal of a female candidate for the presidency  —   that unforgettable “18 million cracks” line only appeared in her speech conceding the Democratic primary race to Obama  —   Clinton has returned to form, embracing the symbolism that has followed her since Wellesley. No matter how taxing her first White House sojourn, and even though she says the best part of her time as secretary of state was that “partisan politics was almost entirely absent from our work” (cough, Benghazi, cough) Clinton is headed once more unto the breach. Why? Unquenched political ambition is the easy, obvious answer, a chance to deploy all that experience and ability on her own, at last. But a line recurs in these two memoirs, a Methodist lesson from Clinton’s Midwestern,   upbringing: “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as you ever can. ” Clinton has tweeted these words and posted them on Facebook recently, and I won’t be surprised if she invokes them again in her convention speech claiming the Democratic nomination. If you support Clinton, the sentiment is inspiring; if not, the notion of Clinton doing all she can by all means possible may terrify. But the final clause  —   “as long as you ever can”  —   is telling. It embodies the Clinton of her memoirs: familiar, enduring, scarred, but eager and available, if we’d only choose her. Even her Secret Service code name, “Evergreen,” is apt, the perfect label for a candidate whose principal qualification for the presidency is her eternal readiness for it.

213925,The many problems with Donald Trump’s call for Russia to spy on Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-07-27,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160728002102/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/27/donald-trump-basically-just-encouraged-russia-to-spy-on-hillary-clinton/,"Donald Trump just walked into another political and foreign policy minefield of his own making. Trump said Wednesday that he hopes a country that just happens to be one of the United States’ most antagonistic fellow world powers  —   Russia  —   has or would obtain unreleased emails from Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. ”They probably have her 33, 000 emails, too. I hope they do,” he said, adding later: ”Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” There are many, many potential problems with this scenario  —   and not just for Clinton’s campaign, but also for U. S. national security. Indeed, the logical extension of his comments is that a foreign power would be deciding how to handle possibly sensitive information about a potential U. S. president. And none other than Trump himself has suggested this kind of information could be used to ”blackmail” Clinton.      The Fix’s Chris Cillizza explains why Donald Trump made a mistake when he called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails. (Peter   Washington Post)   First, a little background: Trump here is referring to approximately half of more than 60, 000 emails on the private server that Clinton used as secretary of state and that were deleted because they were deemed ”personal” and not turned over to State Department investigators. Republicans have cried foul over their deletion. Trump seemed to imply later Wednesday, in a tweet, that he simply wanted the emails to be turned over to the FBI, no matter who might obtain them.   If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton’s 33, 000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2016   But Trump’s comments earlier Wednesday suggested Russia might hand the emails over to the news media, as WikiLeaks did with hacked Democratic National Committee emails last week. As it did with the committee, that could cause major problems  —   except this time for a former top U. S. diplomat who could soon be president. And he has said previously in this campaign, without any evidence, that enemies of the United States ”almost certainly” have accessed Clinton’s emails and are using them to blackmail her. So he’s clearly aware of that possibility. FBI Director James B. Comey said in rebuking Clinton’s use of the email server earlier this month that it’s indeed possible the server had been accessed  —   but that there was no evidence yet that it had happened. ”Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account,” he said. Trump’s aim here seems to be highlighting that Clinton deleted her emails, full stop. If Russia can find them, after all, maybe they will come to light, he seems to suggest. But that scenario could also very plausibly lend itself to the kind of cyberespionage  —   blackmail or otherwise  —   that Trump has already alleged Clinton is being subjected to. The emails were deemed personal and should not contain classified information. Yes, but many   emails Clinton said did not contain classified information were later proven by the FBI to have contained some. And even if the information is all personal in nature, that could be used against Clinton, too.   Trump literally just invited ad encouraged Russia to commit cyberespionage on his political rival  —   Simon Maloy (@SimonMaloy) July 27, 2016     How is calling for a cyberattack from a foreign power anything but treasonous?  —   Douglas Heye (@DougHeye) July 27, 2016   Trump, of course, has gone far outside the mainstream on foreign policy before. He has basically said he might unilaterally pull the United States out of its obligation to defend other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) when they are attacked, if they don’t foot more of the bill for the organization. ”We’re talking about countries that are doing very well,” he told the New York Times last week. ”Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, ’Congratulations, you will be defending yourself. ’” The comment earned stern rebukes from all sides of the U. S.   debate and foreign leaders. The message it sends to allies, experts said, is that the United States can’t be trusted to honor its foreign commitments  —   which would be a major problem for the United States’ standing in the world and for maintaining and building relationships with allies. So Trump is clearly not abiding by the standard protocol of U. S. officials who talk carefully about foreign policy. But Wednesday’s comments ratchet things up even more. Even as he contended that he’s not the preferred candidate of Russia  —   as Democrats have alleged and Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested  —   he’s now hoping Russia has potentially damaging information about a possible U. S. president. That’s stunning. And while Trump did not say he wants Russia to use those emails for blackmail or espionage purposes, his previous comments make clear it’s a possibility he’s very well aware of.

213929,Bill and Hillary Clinton’s incomprehensible marriage,Washington Post,Alyssa Rosenberg,F,2016-07-27,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160728002102/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/07/27/bill-and-hillary-clintons-incomprehensible-marriage/,"Once upon a time, a boy from Arkansas spotted a girl from Illinois across a crowded classroom. And on Tuesday night in Philadelphia, on the night Hillary Rodham Clinton became their party’s official nominee for president, Bill Clinton did his best to make one of the   marriages in the history of American politics fit into the contours of a fairy tale. Okay, a revisionist feminist fairy tale, where the princess eventually saves the prince from the dragon, or the peasant girl ultimately tells the arrogant aristocrat to shove it in favor of lighting the castle on fire and leading a revolution. But watching Bill Clinton argue to the American people that they, too, should love his wife, and trying to narrate his marriage as a wonky fable, was both vexing and sweet at the same time. The harder the Clintons have worked to preserve their marriage, the less easily that marriage has fit into easy stories about what true love should look like. And whenever the Clintons put their marriage at the center of the political cases they make for each other, the relationship becomes more vulnerable to criticism and dissection at the moments when it’s asked to carry the greatest public weight. That complexity is in part a testament to the highly unusual route the Clintons travel, and the unique place they occupy in American history. It’s also about our failure to distinguish between the courage it takes to tap a girl on the back and the effort it takes to stay with her, between persuading her to marry you, and convincing her to stay after you’ve metaphorically burned down that cute little    starter house.    Former President Bill Clinton addresses the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Tuesday, July 26, 2016. (Ricky   Washington Post)  If I hated the choices Clinton’s husband, other politicians, the media and the American public forced her to make in the 1990s, the Clintons’ marriage also taught me that marriage is a mystery  —   not merely in that it’s perplexing, but that its power lies in part in the fact that any given marriage is not comprehensible to outsiders. It may be true, as Dana Bash put it on CNN after Bill Clinton’s speech that in his version of the story “She was the object of desire  …    It actually is incredibly important for people to hear this. ” But there is no explanation of their marriage that the Clintons can give in public that solves for the equation that makes up their relationship. It’s one of those strings of symbols and numbers that runs the universe, and yet is inaccessible to those who live in it. I believe Bill Clinton loves his wife. I cannot comprehend that he has subjected her to the humiliations she suffered through the years. In 1999, Elizabeth Wurtzel described the Clinton marriage as “the horror story of every woman who has lived right  …    only to find it all wrecked by some man who lives to make bonfires out of other people’s   lists, who makes her forget to do the laundry until he asks her to do his. ” Seventeen years later, however apocryphal the stories about Arkansans who thought they’d elected the wrong Clinton, or Bill’s insistence that she should put her own career first, she’s there, the Democratic nominee for president. And he‘s there, doing what political spouses have done for decades, and arguing that because she never quit on him, she’ll never quit on the voters. It’s a promise with extra frisson because we can imagine, from the outside, why she might have given up on that marriage. So who’s right? Is it Clinton’s tortured journey that defines her, or her position on the threshhold of the destination? Her husband’s infidelities, or the stories he tells about being dumbstruck by her, his chronicle of decades of partnership? The grand romantic drama Bill Clinton spun on Tuesday night didn’t answer those questions, or tell us how they navigated the heartbreak and tough going that he alluded to only in the most general terms. However fascinating it might have been to hear him explain not simply why Hillary deserves his love, but how he continued to earn hers, such a speech would have been politically catastrophic, not to mention a failure as a romantic gesture. Bill Clinton has been one of the most gifted orators in American politics for two and a half decades. But even he has to obey the basic laws of storytelling. Just because mass culture and psychology confuse the two doesn’t mean that a lasting marriage can be easily reduced to a mere romance.

214008,Koch political network plans to invoke Hillary Clinton in Senate ads,Washington Post,Matea Gold,F,2016-07-30,2016.0,7.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160731001849/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/30/koch-political-network-plans-to-invoke-hillary-clinton-in-senate-ads/,"COLORADO SPRINGS  —   The Koch political network, which has steadfastly refused to engage in the 2016 presidential contest, plans to invoke Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in paid messages to voters as part of its campaigns supporting GOP Senate candidates, top officials said Saturday. “We are going to tie the Democrat candidates to Hillary Clinton and the failed policies that she supports, and highlight the differences with the Republican candidates that we favor and that we’re supporting,” said Mark Holden, chairman of the board of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the network’s funding arm. In Ohio, for example,   groups may hit Democratic Senate contender and former Ohio governor Ted Strickland on his energy stance, comparing his position to that of Clinton’s.   [In final 100 days, Clinton and Trump to chart different paths to White House]   But Holden said the network has no plans to run an explicit campaign opposing Clinton’s efforts to reach the White House, saying: “We are going to differentiate on policies alone. It’s not going to be  . ” The plans to invoke Clinton in Senate ads come as the network is under pressure from some of its wealthy donors to get off the sidelines and use its national field infrastructure and paid advertising capacity to back GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. But Koch Industries chief executive Charles Koch has refused to budge, repeatedly expressing his dismay with Trump’s tone and policy positions. Still, the invocation of Clinton in   ads is another way that the operation could end up indirectly boosting Trump.   groups have hundreds of staffers in the field, gathering reams of information on voters in key battleground states that filter back to the Republican National Committee and GOP candidates through a   agreement. And the network’s permanent ground force, which far outstrips Trump’s field operation, could help propel Republicans to the polls in key states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and Florida.   [The Kochs’ powerful operation isn’t aimed at helping Trump  —   but it might anyway]   Holden told reporters Saturday that the network will not jump into the presidential race, even after Trump’s choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) a Koch favorite, as his running mate. “We’re focused on the Senate,” he said. “It gets back to what we look at to engage in any electoral contest. We have to have an aligned candidate from a values and beliefs and policy perspective. And then we need to look at what the candidate’s doing: Are they talking about the issues that we believe need to be talked about in a positive, productive way? Are they running a good campaign?” Moments before Holden addressed reporters, Trump  —   who had been in Colorado Springs for a rally Friday  —   tweeted that he had rejected a   with the billionaire conservative brothers. “I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch,” he wrote. “Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!”   [Donald Trump responds to the Khan family: ‘Maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say’]   But Holden said he was not aware of any discussions with Trump’s campaign about a possible meeting. “You will have to talk to him about what his facts are and what he’s relying on,” he said. About 400 conservative donors were scheduled to participate in this weekend’s semiannual meeting of the Koch network, held in a majestic Italianate resort nestled at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The theme of the gathering, which will include policy and political briefings, is a Brighter Future: Reversing America’s Decline, Opening Opportunity for All. A number of top Republican elected officials are set to attend, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( . ); Sens. John Cornyn (Tex.) Cory Gardner (Colo.) Mike Lee (Utah) and Tim Scott (S. C.); Reps. Jason Chaffetz (Utah) Mike Coffman (Colo.) and Mike Pompeo of (Kan. ); and Govs. Matt Bevin of Kentucky, Doug Ducey of Arizona and Scott Walker of Wisconsin. After originally planning to spend $889 million in the 2016 cycle, the Koch operation is now on track to invest $750 million, with about    —   $250 million  —   financing the policy and political campaigns of groups such as Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Concerned Veterans for America and the Libre Initiative and Generation Opportunity, officials said."
214071,Howard Stern makes his pitch: Why Hillary Clinton should do my show,Washington Post,Geoff Edgers,M,2016-08-01,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160802002022/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/08/01/howard-stern-makes-his-pitch-why-hillary-clinton-should-do-my-show/,"Hillary Clinton said it herself. The “public” part of public service has never been easy. Now, with the Democratic nomination in hand, it’s time to meet America. And please, advisors, that doesn’t mean popping up on “Carpool Karaoke. ” It’s time to go on Stern. Don’t do “The Howard Stern Show” because he’s been a Hillary supporter. Do Stern because of what he does: Simply the best broadcast entertainment interview show around. Because, as he said in a rare, more than   interview with The Washington Post, “the ultimate Hillary interview hasn’t been done yet. ” Stern talked about how he would proceed if Clinton agreed to go on his SiriusXM show. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. The Clinton campaign has said no so far. What if you got a call tomorrow that she would love to do the show? What’s your strategy? I don’t think I’d handle Hillary Clinton any differently than I would a musician. I had a three hour conversation with Billy Joel and we really talked about his music writing process, how this happened, how it evolved, and his relationship with his parents, his marriages, the love of the piano and the songwriting process and also the torture of it. You think about politics. Who really would want to go through this scrutiny and the torture and the criticism? Now we see it on Twitter. Everyone’s getting bullied. But politicians have been getting bullied forever and I’m not so cynical. I certainly don’t believe that a young person goes into politics with the idea, I’m going to get rich. I think there is a desire to serve. Is it any different from Steven Tyler saying I want to write songs since I was 9 years old? I wonder what you thought of Bill Clinton’s speech at the convention. Rachel Maddow called it “shocking and weird” because he was talking about Hillary as the object of his desire and, of course, he had his famous affair. When I watched his speech I, too, had that reaction. But look, there are so many hypocrites out there. You know how many guys and women are having affairs? I was able to evaluate Bill Clinton as a president without sitting there. How many great CEOs of companies have had affairs? It’s an epidemic. So for everyone to be so holier than thou and say they can’t buy into the fact that he had a love affair with Hillary. Of course they had a love affair. Trump. He’s been a regular guest on the Stern show over the years. Is it fair to say you like him as a guy but not as a candidate? No. I won’t say that. Before Trump even got in the race, way before he got in the race, I had announced I was supporting Hillary. I believe she would be an extremely powerful president. I don’t dislike Trump as a candidate but I am absolutely enamored by Hillary. And I’ve told Donald that. Hillary as a president was sort of dream of mine for a long time. I thought she was an excellent senator. You voted for Obama but did you support her over him in the 2008 primary? I did. If Hillary agrees to come on, do you do that interview in your studio or do you go somewhere? To me, I’m on satellite radio and that’s the best place to do it. Having said that, if there was some kind of concept of doing it somewhere else, I’d do it. Did you hear Marc Maron’s podcast with Obama? I didn’t. No. I had [Maron] on once but honestly, I haven’t heard his show. The big thing is Maron does it in his garage, which is his studio, and Obama showed up to his garage. For Hillary, I think it would be better if she came to your turf and experienced in that way. It’s be nice. But it’s almost irrelevant. [Pause] Yeah, I hear what you’re saying. Now on second thought, maybe you’re right. That’s the setting I’m comfortable in. and the more comfortable I am, it’s like when you have someone over. If you’re in familiar surroundings, you can make someone feel welcomed in your place. [Is Howard Stern going soft or just getting sharper?]  So your producers reached out to the Clinton campaign. Do you ever get involved to make a stronger push? I wouldn’t feel comfortable having someone in who is pressured somehow and kind of overhype the experience. They’ve got to come to that conclusion on their own. Having said that, we’ve reached out and said, we’d love to have Hillary on. And it would expose her to an audience that might not be thinking of voting for her. She could also have a direct pipeline to a lot of people who wouldn’t normally get to hear her speak the way we have the ability to do it. There’s a lot of time to develop an answer. Not do a sound bite. And oddly enough, because of that format, I notice a lot of the media takes the interviews we do and makes sound bites out of them. Well, Howard, one of the biggest sound bites is Trump. He has said he never supported the Iraq war, but there’s a clip of him voicing his support in an interview on your show in 2002. Somebody comes on and everyone suddenly goes, ‘oh, Howard Stern got a lot of out of this person or that person.’ It’s because we’re having a real conversation. Alec Baldwin said to me, I don’t really want to do any other show but yours. Why is that? He said, ‘Anywhere else I go, it’s like hurry up and answer. And when I come on your show, I really get to explain myself.’ Lady Gaga said to me, ‘I feel most safe when I’m doing your show.’ And that floored me. The first time I remember you really talking politically was with Christie Todd Whitman. And at that time, more than 20 years ago, it wasn’t about your political views. It was basically, ‘hey, the first politician who calls me, I endorse.’ On terrestrial radio it was a whole different approach. It was about me. In my mind it had to be about me. It had to be outrageous. I didn’t have the opportunity or the desire or the medium where I could ask Christie Todd Whitman real questions. I had to be, okay, I’m going to get on the air. I had 5 or 10 minutes. If you tuned in at 6:10 in the morning, I had to drag you to 6:20. How could I get you to stay with me for those 5 minutes? Wham, bam thank you ma’am. And [Whitman opponent James] Florio would have gotten your support if he had called first. That’s right. And so it was about me. Look how powerful I am. Me me me me. The show I’m doing isn’t about that  …     What my approach is now, because I am on satellite, it’s a different show.   …     A broadcaster who doesn’t change becomes irrelevant very quickly. Christie Todd Whitman really did herself a service in coming on your show. She came on and she was absolutely human. You don’t get to see that in everyday politics. Our media world is changing so rapidly. And from what I can see, the approach of getting up on the stump and making a speech is an antiquated as going back to the days of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. I don’t even think going on some show and being   and doing a game show format or a sketch, I don’t think that’s the way to run for president. The position is just too goddamned important. It’s as if they think we go to the polls and say, ‘oh, that candidate can poke fun at himself. I’ll vote for him.’ It’s not the way it works. The only way it works is the same way you promote a record album on my show or a movie. Don’t promote the movie. Promote you and being a human being and relating to people on a very human level and then they’ll vote for you or they’ll go see your movie. So with Hillary, do you ask her about the   scandal? I would leave that to the interview on “Meet the Press” or the Fox News channel, CNN, George Stephanopoulos, even Matt Lauer. They can do that interview. How about her marriage? You have to ask, right? But I don’t think it’s necessarily the central thing. When you’re talking about the scope of someone’s life and that becomes something in their life, it becomes more comfortable to talk about. You’ve heard my interviews. I don’t avoid topics. When Gwen Stefani walked in I didn’t know if she was talking about her marriage or not. I know her [former] husband very well. Gavin. I like him very much. But I wasn’t going to avoid the topic either. But it wasn’t the focus. I didn’t have her walk into the studio and go, ‘Gwen, I can’t believe what happened with Gavin.’ That’s just poor form and that’s not the way I approach a conversation in my home. “Welcome to dinner and tell me about that affair from 10 years ago. ” Exactly. You’d have to be a complete idiot to do that. Or if you were just looking to do a confrontational show and have the person walk out. I know guys in radio who do that. They ask the worst question up front and then the person walks out. Back to Trump. You’re obviously a big believer in free speech. He’s been blocking the press and trying to control the press and trying to shut the press out. I can’t imagine you support that. Trump is not a traditional candidate. Quite frankly, I’ve spoken to Donald Trump off the air and I’ve said, why the hell you would want to be president? You’ve got such a great life. You’ve got a spectacular wife. If you’ve ever checked out this place,    it is fantastic. He’s got lots of money. He’s got all the toys that a person would want. Why on god’s name would you want that? And I will tell you the reason he’s such a good guest on your show is because he’s unfiltered and he’s ready to say anything. What did he tell you when asked him why he’s running? I don’t know that that’s fair for me to say what he said to me off the air. [From playboy to president? Trump’s past crude sex talk collides with his White House bid] You’ve had Steve Martin on, Bill Murray, McCartney, almost everyone. Is Hillary the Holy Grail at this point? I wouldn’t say that. I would be fascinated by Hillary Clinton. I think she’s a fascinating person and I also think no one has sat down with her and really provided a forum for her to not be the politician but to be the human being. So would that be a fabulous moment for me to try to communicate with Hillary Clinton in front of my audience? Yes. It would be fabulous for me. The dinner conversation I would have privately with Hillary Clinton is the conversation I’d like to put on the radio. And I love the idea it could go on for three hours. It could go on all night. And so yeah, would it be the Holy Grail? Sure, it would be great. In the same way that Mick Jagger would be the Holy Grail and the same way that when I talk with Paul McCartney, it’s the Holy Grail. And you can ask him, ‘gee, when you wrote ‘Maybe I’m Amazed,’ what was on your mind? The same thing. What was that moment, Hillary, when you decided you wanted to be president? I’d want to hear what it was like being so accomplished and so skilled and then basically deciding, hey, Bill, I’ll become a mother and let you do it. I talk to actors about what it’s like when they audition for a movie or they get offered a movie, they turn it down and then someone else takes it, and it becomes the biggest hit. Isn’t that the same thing in Hillary Clinton’s life? Yes, you go to law school, you’re an intellectual and suddenly you’re on TV getting grilled about some offhand comment about baking cookies. And oh my god, you have to sit there, all this time as a senator, building, building, building and this guy comes out of nowhere like Obama. And then in relation to her entire history as a little girl. And everybody always saying, yeah, ‘you can be the first lady but you can’t be the president.’ This is fascinating stuff. And there is the idea that after she lost eight years ago, she didn’t take her marbles and go home. Clinton participated and stayed in the game. How many people do that? And I’ve got news for you. I relate to that on such a human level. I remember being in Detroit radio and being at my lowest and it never once occurred to me to quit radio. That’s when I dug in my heels in and said, I’ve got to get better. I’m not working hard enough. And I was working day and night on this thing. We have heard Hillary joke around on “Saturday Night Live” and reference how she’s sometimes perceived, but I have never heard her emotionally open up and engage on what it’s like to feel that rejection and to bounce back. That’s exactly right. And now you know my agenda. I don’t give a f —   about   and scandals. She’s already talked to the FBI about that. She’s testified. That’s not my thing. My thing is, ‘wow, as a human being how do you succeed?’ Don’t we all need to know how to succeed. This is a phenomenal story."
214106,Donald Trump just downgraded Hillary Clinton from ‘the devil’ to the ‘founder of ISIS’,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-08-03,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160804000645/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/03/donald-trump-just-downgraded-hillary-clinton-from-the-devil-to-the-founder-of-isis/,"Donald Trump is indeed reforming his ways and softening his tone. Earlier this week, he called Hillary Clinton ”the devil.” Now, she’s simply the ”founder of ISIS.” In his speech Wednesday afternoon in Daytona Beach, Fla. Trump appeared to be heeding his advisers’ reported wishes and giving a subdued,   speech criticizing Clinton’s foreign policy in places like Libya. He said President Obama probably regretted making her secretary of state. Okay, that’s at least plausible. Then he went back to  . ”She should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS,” he said of the Islamic State. Yep, same old Donald. But as noted above, the ”founder of ISIS” isn’t even the worst thing Trump has called Clinton this week. (It’s hard to think of a worse   than calling someone ”the devil. ”) And Trump’s   is only getting more hyperbolic  —   not less  —   even as Trump’s team and Republicans have expressed the hope that he’ll tone it down and try to fix the many things that ail his campaign. Trump promised to take the gloves off in recent days, and he has done just that. Indeed, as the timeline below shows, some of Trump’s earliest criticisms of Clinton now seem almost quaint by comparison. April: ‘Crooked Hillary’ ”I’m not controlled by the special interests and the lobbyists,” he said in Dexter, N. Y. before christening a nickname for Clinton. ”And they control crooked Hillary.” Early May: An ‘enabler’ for her husband’s infidelity “She’s been the total enabler,” he said in Oregon. ”She would go after these women and destroy their lives. She was an unbelievably nasty, mean enabler, and what she did to a lot of those women is disgraceful.”  : ‘Trigger happy’ “On foreign policy, Hillary is ” Trump said in May. “She is, she’s  . She’s got a bad temperament. ”Her decisions in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Libya have cost trillions of dollars, thousands of lives and have totally unleashed ISIS. ” Late June: Perhaps the ‘most corrupt’ presidential candidate ever Trump said in New York that Clinton ”may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States.” Early July: ‘A dirty rotten liar’ ”We say Lie. Lie. Lie. Lie. Lie. Lie!” Trump said. ”Dirty rotten liar!”  : ‘The devil’ On Monday, Trump said Bernie Sanders made a deal with the devil  —   Clinton. ”But he made a deal with the devil,” he said. ”She’s the devil. He made a deal with the devil. It’s true.” On Friday, he similarly said Sanders ”sold his soul to the devil.” Tuesday: ‘A pathological liar’ On Tuesday, Trump tweeted a video labeling Clinton a ”pathological liar.”   The Washington Post calls out #CrookedHillary for what she REALLY is. A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR! Watch that nose grow! pic. twitter.   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2016   ‘The founder of ISIS’ ”We let ISIS take this position,” Trump said Wednesday. ”It was Hillary Clinton; she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.” The crowd responded by chanting ”Lock her up!”   Trump says Hillary should get a medal as the ”founder of ISIS.” Crowd chants ”Lock her up!

Calling the presidential nominee of the opposite party ”the devil” or the ”founder” of a terrorist organization seems far less shocking in the age of Trump, but that’s really just because we’ve become desensitized  —   by Trump.

214239,Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have very different relationships with the truth,Washington Post,Daniel W. Drezner,M,2016-08-08,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160809004016/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/08/donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-have-very-different-relationships-with-the-truth/,"The latest polls from   York Times and   Post show Hillary Clinton with a secure lead, but they also show that voters believe her to be roughly as honest as   veteran Donald Trump. This has clearly nettled close observers of this presidential race. Over the weekend two prominent columnists have attempted to outline the relationship between the major party nominees and the truth. On Sunday, the New York Times’ Nick Kristof argued that when comparing Trump and Clinton as liars, Trump wins and it’s not close: The idea that they are even in the same league is preposterous. If deception were a sport, Trump would be the Olympic gold medalist; Clinton would be an honorable mention at her local Y.   …     Let’s investigate. One metric comes from independent   websites. As of Friday, PolitiFact had found 27 percent of Clinton’s statements that it had looked into were mostly false or worse, compared with 70 percent of Trump’s. It said 2 percent of Clinton’s statements it had reviewed were egregious “pants on fire” lies, compared with 19 percent of Trump’s. So Trump has nine times the share of   lies as Clinton.   …     If Clinton declares that she didn’t chop down a cherry tree, that might mean that she actually used a chain saw to cut it down. Or that she ordered an aide to chop it down. As for Trump, he will insist, “I absolutely did not chop down that cherry tree,” even as he clutches the ax with which he chopped it down moments earlier on Facebook Live.  On Friday, however, my Post colleague Fareed Zakaria offered up a different interpretation of Trump’s relationship with the truth: Harry Frankfurt, an eminent moral philosopher and former professor at Princeton, wrote a brilliant essay in 1986 called “On Bullshit. ” (Frankfurt himself wrote about Trump in this vein, as have Jeet Heer and Eldar Sarajlic.) In the essay, Frankfurt distinguishes crucially between lies and B. S.: “Telling a lie is an act with a sharp focus. It is designed to insert a particular falsehood at a specific point. . . . In order to invent a lie at all, [the teller of a lie] must think he knows what is true. ” But someone engaging in B. S. Frankfurt says, “is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all . . . except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. ” Frankfurt writes that the B. S. ’s “focus is panoramic rather than particular” and that he has “more spacious opportunities for improvisation, color, and imaginative play. This is less a matter of craft than of art. Hence the familiar notion of the ‘bullshit artist.’ ” This has been Trump’s mode all his life. He boasts  —   and boasts and boasts  —   about his business, his buildings, his books, his wives. Much of it is a concoction of hyperbole and falsehoods. And when he’s found out, he’s like that guy we have all met at a bar who makes wild claims but when confronted with the truth, quickly responds, “I knew that!” As a huge fan of Harry Frankfurt’s brilliant opus, I have to side with Zakaria here. Indeed, Trump, his ghostwriters and his supporters would agree. Consider that even Trump’s own acolytes have to hem and haw when it comes to the campaign’s policy proposals. Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter for Trump’s “The Art of the Deal,” told the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer that Trump’s carelessness with the truth caused him to write about Trump’s penchant for exaggeration in the book: Schwartz says of Trump, “He lied strategically. He had a complete lack of conscience about it. ” Since most people are “constrained by the truth,” Trump’s indifference to it “gave him a strange advantage. ”  …    . When Schwartz began writing “The Art of the Deal,” he realized that he needed to put an acceptable face on Trump’s loose relationship with the truth. So he concocted an artful euphemism. Writing in Trump’s voice, he explained to the reader, “I play to people’s fantasies. . . . People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration  —   and it’s a very effective form of promotion. ” Schwartz now disavows the passage. “Deceit,” he told me, is never “innocent. ” He added, “ ‘Truthful hyperbole’ is a contradiction in terms. It’s a way of saying, ‘It’s a lie, but who cares?’ ” Trump, he said, loved the phrase. Donald Trump does not intend to evade the truth  —   he simply does not care whether what he says is the truth or not. When Trump met with myriad editorial boards during the primaries, he intimated that he focuses on his   position in speeches because that’s what drives his crowds crazy. As Gail Collins wrote after Trump met with the New York Times editorial board in January: The most optimistic analysis of Trump as a presidential candidate is that he just doesn’t believe in positions, except the ones you adopt for strategic purposes when you’re making a deal. So you obviously can’t explain how you’re going to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, because it’s going to be the first bid in some future monster negotiation session. Trump fits Frankfurt’s definition of a B. S. artist to a T. And, it should be noted, this also means that he occasionally tells the truth by accident. But the notion put forward by his supporters that Trump is daring to speak hard truths is laughable, since Trump has no clue what is true and what isn’t. Frankfurt’s distinction between B. S. and lying also helps get at how we should think of Clinton and her seeming inability to completely put her email scandal to rest. The   sites show that compared to all of the other candidates this cycle, Clinton has been the most truthful. But, like any politician, Clinton hasn’t been completely honest  —   indeed, PolitiFact gave Clinton a “pants on fire” rating in her Fox News Sunday interview with Chris Wallace that, in an ordinary campaign week, would have caused her all sorts of agita. All politicians offer up certain amounts of B. S. and lies at various points. Fundamentally truthful politicians will try to avoid outright lies by parsing their words as carefully as possible. Bill Clinton was a fundamentally truthful politician who nonetheless lied at times. He was such a good politician, however, that he could sell his lies with conviction. Hillary Clinton might be a good leader, but she is not a conventionally great politician. When she has to lie  —   which, again, is not all that often  —   she doesn’t look good doing it. In contrast to Trump, she’s painfully aware of her relationship with the truth. Zakaria is right and Kristof is wrong about Trump. Between Clinton and Trump, Clinton is the bigger and badder liar  —   but that’s because Clinton cares enough about the truth to know a lie when she tells one. Trump is a mediocre B. S. artist on a stage that is way too big for his meager abilities."
214294,Do menacing comments about Hillary Clinton cross the First Amendment line?,Washington Post,James Hoefler,M,2016-08-10,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160811004119/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/do-menacing-comments-about-hillary-clinton-cross-the-first-amendment-line/2016/08/10/25259344-5f0f-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html,"James Hoefler is a professor of political science at Dickinson College specializing in American politics and public policy.        The 2016 presidential election has been notable for the rhetorical vitriol pervading the campaign, and unfortunately Donald Trump’s suggestion Tuesday that “Second Amendment people” might be able to offer some sort of corrective to a Hillary Clinton presidency is merely a continuation of this   pattern.  At a July rally in Raleigh, N. C. Trump supporters can be heard chanting “Hang that     !” Michael Folk, a Republican legislator from West Virginia, added his voice to the chorus several days later, tweeting that Clinton should be “hung on the Mall in Washington, DC. ” Al Baldasaro, a Republican legislator from New Hampshire and a retired Marine who serves as a Trump adviser, joined the fray, stating in a radio interview that, “Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason. ” Licking County, Ohio, Commissioner Duane Flowers chimed in at a public meeting shortly thereafter, saying that Clinton should be “hanging from a tree. ” Do any of these statements cross the line of protected speech under the First Amendment? Probably not. The relevant federal statue here  —   18 USC Section 879( a)(3)  —   makes it a felony to threaten a presidential candidate with death or bodily harm. But the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that speakers should be accorded fairly wide latitude to express themselves in ways that do not pose a real and imminent threat. For example, in the weeks prior to the 2008 presidential election, California resident Walter Bagdasarian posted the following on a public message board: “[Barack] Obama . . . will have a 50 cal in the head soon. ” Bagdasarian followed this post with another, which began: “Shoot the   . ” The Secret Service investigated and found weapons in Bagdasarian’s home, including a . 50 caliber rifle. Bagdasarian was convicted, but his conviction was overturned by the 9th Circuit Court, which ruled  that Section 879 could only be invoked if the speaker’s words went beyond expression of an opinion to constitute “a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily harm. ” The court reasoned that while Bagdasarian’s posts might be loathsome and menacing they did not reach the level of a “true threat. ” While it is within the purview of the Secret Service to investigate those who have made menacing comments regarding Clinton, those comments probably fall within the realm of protected speech, if only because Bagdasarian’s patently more egregious speech was found to fall within the limits of protected speech.  Even before Tuesday’s comments about the Second Amendment, however, Trump’s own speech raised serious constitutional questions. After a protester threw a tomato at a February campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Trump encouraged those in the crowd to take action. “If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, okay? Just knock the hell  —   I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. ” Shortly thereafter, John McGraw was charged with assault and disorderly conduct after reportedly   a   Trump protester at a North Carolina rally. Did Trump cross the First Amendment line with his comments? We look for guidance to the Supreme Court’s most recent case to test the limits of this sort of speech: Brandenburg v. Ohio. In that 1969 decision, the court set forth a   test to determine the contours of First Amendment sanctuary: Was criminal action (1) intended, (2) imminent and (3) likely? Trump’s intention seems genuine and unambiguous, especially in the context of his comments after a protester was ejected at a February rally in Las Vegas, when Trump said: “I’d like to punch him in the face. ” Perhaps these were rhetorical flourishes, but it would be hard for anyone who watched videos of these events to come to the conclusion that Trump’s intentions were anything less than sincere. Trump’s language also seems to qualify with regard to imminence. That Trump supporters have acted along these lines at subsequent rallies would suggest that criminal acts advocated by Trump qualify as imminent in the literal sense of that term. Trump’s speech also seems to meet the    likelihood test. At the very least, Trump’s offer to pay the criminal defense costs of anyone who followed his advice would seem to increase the likelihood that someone would act on that advice. We all celebrate the First Amendment and its broad protections of speech, as egregious and unpresidential as that language might sometimes seem. But all political liberties come with limits, and a case could be made that Trump’s brutal entreaties have exceeded that limit. Should he continue to exhort violence at his rallies, it may be his own legal defense needs, rather than those of his followers, that he will need to worry about.

214476,Documents from the Hillary Clinton email investigation might be made public,Washington Post,Matt Zapotosky,M,2016-08-17,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160818003400/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/17/documents-from-the-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-might-be-made-public/,"A “substantial amount” of material that the FBI delivered to Congress about the Hillary Clinton email investigation  —   including a summary of agents’ interview with top aide Huma Abedin  —   appears to be unclassified, which means it could possibly be released to the public, according to a   legislator whose staff had reviewed the documents. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Charles E. Grassley is calling for Senate officials to separate the classified from the unclassified documents in order to turn over as much information to the public as possible. Grassley ( ) said Wednesday that many of the FBI documents appear to be unclassified or are specifically marked as such. He requested that the director of the Office of Senate Security identify and separate the unclassified material so that it might ultimately be released. “If it isn’t classified, it ought to be public,” Grassley said in an interview. It is unclear how soon that might happen. Grassley said it might take a significant amount of time to separate classified from unclassified material. Among the materials the FBI turned over to lawmakers on Tuesday were a   summary of its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state; interview summaries  —   known as “302s”  —   with Clinton, Abedin and others; and copies of classified emails that were recovered from the server, according to federal law enforcement officials and Grassley.   [FBI defends decision not to charge Clinton as it submits probe documents to Congress]   Right now, the materials are only able to be reviewed by members of Congress in what’s known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) and the FBI issued a statement saying they were being provided with the expectation such material would “not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence. ” The public release of many of the documents in the FBI’s probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server would be significant, offering prospective voters an even more thorough look into the criminal investigation that has long dogged the Democratic presidential nominee. While FBI Director James B. Comey has said publicly his investigators concluded neither Clinton nor her aides should face criminal charges because of the server, he has also called her conduct “extremely careless” and suggested those who acted as she did might face severe professional consequences.   [FBI says no criminal charges in Clinton email probe]   The release of more details about the bureau’s probe would likely provide details that Clinton’s opponents could use as political fodder, even though they ultimately led the FBI to conclude she did not intend to mishandle classified information, nor was she criminally negligent. In a letter to the director of the Office of Senate Security Wednesday, Grassley wrote that the FBI’s interview summaries of agents’ conversations with Abedin and several other witnesses “appear to be entirely unclassified, as there are no header or footer markings on each page and every paragraph is portion marked as UNCLASSIFIED. ” Grassley wrote that of the 32 pages in the FBI’s “Letterhead Memorandum” summarizing the investigation, fewer than a dozen and a half paragraphs were marked “SECRET,” and the rest were marked “” or for official use only. Grassley asked the Office of Senate Security Director to provide a copy of the unclassified FBI documents, and noted his staff had asked the FBI confirm certain documents were unclassified. As to whether the FBI might block him from eventually releasing those, he said, “I hope that issue doesn’t come up,” and noted Comey had on multiple occasions promised to offer transparency on this case. According to its website, the Senate Security Office is responsible for the “administration of classified national security information and personnel, communications, and computer security programs to protect classified information in Senate offices and committees. ” It serves as “liaison to the executive branch” on national security matters.   [Sen. Charles Grassley’s letter on the Clinton email probe]   “I don’t think we should have any trouble getting the   …     unclassified stuff made public,” Grassley said. The FBI declined to comment for this story. The bureau has come under fire for its decision to turn anything over to Congress  —   a highly unusual step that the agency said is “consistent with our commitment to transparency with respect to the FBI’s investigation of former Secretary of State Clinton’s use of a personal email server. ” Rep. Adam Schiff ( .) said in a statement, “This will neither serve the interests of justice nor aid Congress in its responsibilities and will merely set a precedent for the FBI to turn over closed case files whenever one party in Congress does not like a prosecutorial decision. This has been done in the name of transparency, but as this precedent chills the cooperation of other witnesses in the future, I suspect the Department of Justice will later come to refer to it by a different name  —   mistake. ” Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign, said the handing over of documents was “an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further   the career professionals at the FBI. ” But he added that “if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks. ” Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who has been among the legislators aggressively pushing for more information on the Clinton case, said Wednesday, “Clearly, there are things that could and should be made public. Even [Clinton is] asking for that. ” But he added that his staff would look at the materials inside the secure facility to prevent leaks.

214494,Bill Clinton’s misleading claim about ‘marked classified’ information in Hillary Clinton’s emails,Washington Post,Michelle Ye Hee Lee,F,2016-08-17,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160818003400/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/17/bill-clintons-misleading-claim-about-marked-classified-information-in-hillary-clintons-emails/,"“The FBI director said, when he testified to Congress, he had to amend the previous day’s statement, that she had never received any emails marked classified. They saw two little notes with a ‘C’ on it. This is the biggest load of bull I ever heard. They were about telephone calls that she needed to make. And the State Department put a little ‘C’ on it to discourage people from discussing it in public, in the event that the secretary of state, whoever it is, doesn’t make the phone call. Does that sound threatening to the national security to you?   …     And the truth is that it was a mistake for her to use her personal email, even though her predecessors had, and her successor John Kerry did, for a year until it was no longer legal. But she should have known there’d be a different set of rules applied to her if she ever ran for president. The truth is, when the State Department asked all the previous secretaries of state to give them any records that would help them fill out their records  —   because they didn’t have a lot of records  —   she was the only one who gave anything. ”  —   former president Bill Clinton, election forum for Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, Aug. 12, 2016 At a voter forum   by the Asian American Journalists Association and nonpartisan civic engagement group APIAVote, Clinton was asked to explain to voters why they should trust Hillary Clinton after her email scandal. In his answer, Clinton summarized two common Democratic talking points about Hillary Clinton’s emails. As a public service, we keep a roundup of all Clinton email fact checks at wapo. . Reader suggestions are always welcome. (Full disclosure: This reporter is an officer of AAJA and helped plan this event.) In August 2015, we gave Two Pinocchios to Clinton’s claims about classified materials in her emails. Her very careful and legalistic phrasing raised suspicions, as she left open the possibility of receiving classified information that was not correctly marked. FBI Director James B. Comey announced the FBI’s findings on July 5, 2016, saying that 110 emails in 52 email chains were found “to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received,” including a “very small number” of emails that bore markings. In light of that information, we updated the rating to Four Pinocchios. Then, after Comey gave more details during a hearing on July 7, we received countless emails from readers disputing our   update given the “ ” markings. We also received a similar slew of emails after we gave Hillary Clinton Four Pinocchios for statements she made about Comey’s testimony. Thus we will use Bill Clinton’s statement as an explanation about why the   talking point does not vindicate Hillary Clinton’s previous claims about classified materials. The Facts Classified materials The news of Hillary Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of state broke in March 2015. Since then, she has made several, technically worded claims about classified material in her emails. First, she said: “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material. ” (March 10, 2015, initial news conference) Then she added whether there were emails classified “at the time”: “I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time. ” (July 2015) Then she started specifying emails “marked” or “designated”: “I’m confident that this process will prove that I never sent nor received any email that was marked classified. ” (August 2015) Clinton mostly used this “marked classified” language from then on. On July 5, 2016, Comey announced that the FBI would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. However, he said the following about the 30, 000 emails that Clinton returned to the State Department:  110 emails in 52 email chains were found “to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. ” That contradicted her claim about information classified “at the time,” and her earlier, general claim that there “is no classified material” in her emails. Eight of the chains contained information that was “top secret” at the time they were sent.   chains contained “secret” information. Eight contained “confidential” information, the lowest classification. Another 2, 000 emails were “ ” (emails that have reason to be classified now, even if they were not classified at the time they were sent). “A very small number of the emails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. ” This contradicted Clinton’s claim that she did not send or receive materials “marked” classified.  On July 6, State Department spokesman John Kirby said the department was aware of two emails with a classification marking, and that they were marked classified by mistake. They were call sheets, bearing names of people Clinton planned to call. Kirby said the call sheet markings “were a human error; they didn’t need to be there. ” The process is for the secretary to decide to make the call, then change the markings to unclassified, Kirby said. He did not answer why the markings were still there. State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement that call sheets are often marked at the “Confidential” level prior to the decision that the secretary of state will make the call. “Often, once it is clear the Secretary intends to make a call, the Department then considers the call sheet SBU [sensitive but unclassified] or unclassified and marks it appropriately. The classification of a call sheet therefore is not necessarily fixed, and staffers in the Secretary’s office who are involved in preparing and finalizing these call sheets understand that. Given this context, it appears the markings in the documents raised by the press were no longer necessary or appropriate at the time they were sent. ” Per State Department guidelines, documents “generally should be marked conspicuously with their overall classification level” with a banner, along with declassification instructions. “Portion markings” are applied to individual paragraphs within classified documents. A “C” in parentheses indicates confidential information. Generally, that marking “would not alone meet the full requirements under the Department’s classification guide for marking a document as classified,” Toner said. On July 7, Comey testified for five hours before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He explained there were three emails that bore the marking “(c)” but did not have a header. Spokesmen for Bill Clinton and the Hillary Clinton campaign sent us the following exchange from the hearing, during which Comey said it would be a “reasonable inference” that Clinton may have considered the email unclassified without a header. Rep. Matt Cartwright ( . ): According to the manual, if you’re going to classify something, there has to be a header on the document. Right?  Comey: Correct.  Cartwright: Was there a header on the three documents that we’ve discussed today that had the little “c” in the text someplace?  Comey: No. They were three  . The “c” was in the body, in the text, but there was no header on the email or in the text.  Cartwright: So if Secretary Clinton really were an expert at what’s classified and what’s not classified and were following the manual, the absence of a header would tell her immediately that those three documents were not classified. Am I correct in that?  Comey: That would be a reasonable inference. When asked whether the FBI had consulted with the State Department about the markings, Comey said: “I’m highly confident we consulted with them and got their view on it. I don’t know about what happened yesterday [July 6, when Kirby said the markings were by mistake]. Maybe their view has changed or they found things out that we didn’t know. But I’m highly confident we consulted with them about it. ” Comey did not say that “she had never received any emails marked classified,” as Bill Clinton says. That description is closer to what Rep. Elijah Cummings ( .) the committee’s ranking member, concluded at the end of the hearing: “On the claim that Secretary Clinton sent or received emails that were marked as classified, that claim has now been significantly undercut. Those documents were not classified and those markings were not proper. ” Still, Comey said Clinton should have known better: “There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. ” He noted that “even if information is not marked ‘classified’ in an   participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it. ” On July 8, Clinton’s language over emails changed again: “I certainly did not believe that I received or sent any material that was classified, and, indeed, any of the documents that have been referred to, I think were not marked, or were marked inaccurately, as has now been clarified. ” Strictly speaking, classification markings do not render information classified, and the absence of classification markings do not render it unclassified, said Steven Aftergood, director of the government secrecy project at the Federation of American Scientists. In fact, a person can share classified information at a cocktail party. “If there is no banner or header at the top of a classified email indicating that it is classified, then it is improperly marked. But the lack of such a banner does not in itself render the email unclassified. There might still be classified information in it,” Aftergood said. “The lack of a banner does, however, explain how a recipient might easily consider it unclassified. Isolated portion markings such as ‘(C)’ might easily be overlooked or dismissed as errors, especially if their content seems innocuous. ” On Aug. 16, the FBI sent a letter to Congress clarifying that “the fact that Secretary Clinton received emails containing ‘(C)’ portion markings is not clear evidence of knowledge or intent. ” These three emails were forwarded to Hillary Clinton. The State Department determined that one of the emails contained classified information, the FBI said in the letter. Comparison to predecessors Democrats often describe Clinton’s emails as nothing more than standard operating procedure among previous secretaries of state. This is misleading, and Bill Clinton should know better than to repeat it. Here’s a summary of our findings; for more details, read our     here and here. The State Department Office of Inspector General’s May 2016 report found Clinton’s email use should be evaluated in the context of the clearer guidance under her tenure, and the memorandums “specifically discussing the obligation” for officials to use department systems in most circumstances. These standards grew more detailed and sophisticated over time as technology advanced, not because “a different set of rules” were applied since she was expected to run for president, as Bill Clinton says. Clinton’s case is not an    comparison to her predecessors or to her successor John Kerry for two major reasons: She was the only one to have operated solely on a private email server, and she had access to more electronic records than her predecessors. Madeleine Albright never used email for work. Condoleezza Rice did not use personal email for work, and did not use much email in general. John Kerry uses his personal email infrequently, and forwards it to his department email when he does; Clinton never set up a department account. Kerry used his personal email most when he was transitioning from his Senate office to the State Department. It’s misleading to compare Clinton to these three. That comes down to one predecessor, Colin Powell. He was the only other secretary of state to use a personal email account like Clinton. But Powell’s staff has said the account has been closed “for a number of years,” and that Powell does not have access to it anymore, and he did not retain or make printed copies before his tenure ended in 2005. So he can’t actually turn over any records anymore, like Clinton can. State Department guidelines for emails were “very fluid” during Powell’s tenure, the inspector general found. It was after Powell left in 2005 that private email guidelines became more specific. The Pinocchio Test Bill Clinton is correct that Comey “amended” his statement in the hearing, to provide more details about what the FBI had found. But Comey did not say Hillary Clinton “had never received any emails marked classified. ” Two of three emails that had portion markings were call sheets that were improperly marked, and State Department considers the markings no longer necessary or appropriate at the time they were sent. Comey acknowledged that Clinton may not have known what the   marking meant. The whole dispute over the little “c” versus big “C,” portion markings versus header, and so on, is the political equivalent of   monte. Democrats, like Bill Clinton, have   Comey’s comments from the   hearing to declare Hillary Clinton vindicated. But what they conveniently sweep under the rug are the 110 emails  —   which were not a part of the 2, 000 that were retroactively classified  —   that were found to “contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. ” Moreover, the diversion to “ ” markings is an effort to distract the public from the disturbing finding by the FBI that Clinton was “extremely careless” in handling her emails, and should have protected the information whether or not it had a classification marking. And it distracts voters from the fact that for more than a year, Clinton modified her excuse over and over to position herself in a way she can declare she was technically right in some form or another. Bill Clinton also repeated the Democratic excuse that she used a personal email account just like her predecessor, and that she turned over more email records than her predecessors did. This comparison is a pathetic and misleading attempt to normalize Hillary Clinton’s use of her personal email account and play down the fact that she was the only secretary of state to use a private server. The decision to use a private server is the root of all of the political difficulties concerning her email practices.

214500,"Clinton Foundation to restrict foreign, corporate donations if Hillary Clinton wins",Washington Post,Abby Phillip,F,2016-08-18,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160819001027/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-foundation-to-restrict-foreign-corporate-donations-if-hillary-clinton-wins/2016/08/18/af237cc8-6590-11e6-96c0-37533479f3f5_story.html,"The Clinton Foundation announced Thursday that it would no longer accept donations from corporations or foreign entities if Hillary Clinton is elected president. The decision comes amid mounting criticism of how the foundation operated during her tenure as secretary of state, potentially allowing donors to seek special access through her government post. Former president Bill Clinton also announced to staff Thursday that the final meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative would be held in September in New York City, regardless of the outcome of the election. A spokesman for the foundation confirmed the decisions, which were first reported by the Associated Press. The moves also come amid new allegations that foundation donors may have been given favored access while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department. Republican nominee Donald Trump has been highly critical of the foundation for accepting money from foreign governments  —   in particular Saudi Arabia, saying the contributions undermine Clinton’s record on women’s rights.   Former president Bill Clinton speaks to participants in the annual gathering of the Clinton Global Initiative America, which is a part of the Clinton Foundation, in Denver in 2015. (Brennan  )  CGI, launched in 2005, is an arm of the foundation that hosts gatherings bringing together government leaders, private companies and    organizations to discuss ways to solve the world’s problems. The initiative’s chief event is an annual meeting in New York City, tied to the United Nations General Assembly. The meetings provide networking opportunities for participants and a forum for private companies to make pledges to conduct charitable projects around the world, monitored by the Clinton Foundation. The Clintons have long acknowledged that significant changes would need to be made to the foundation in the event that she is elected. “There’ll clearly be some changes in what the Clinton Foundation does and how we do it, and we’ll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it,” Bill Clinton said at a CGI event in Atlanta in June.  [Two Clintons, 41 years, $3 billion: Inside the Clinton donor network.]  According to a newly released batch of emails obtained by the conservative group Judicial Watch through a public records lawsuit, a foundation aide asked State Department staff to arrange a meeting on behalf of a foundation donor, a wealthy Ni ger ian businessman of Lebanese descent who had donated between $1 million and $5 million, according to disclosure reports. The official said that he never connected with the businessman and denied that anyone had asked him to meet with the man.

Trump and his family members have donated to the foundation in the past. When asked about it on the campaign trail, he has said that he regrets doing so, accusing the foundation of mismanaging its finances. The Boston Globe’s editorial board called on the Clintons this week to shutter the foundation if she became president, saying it would pose an unacceptable conflict, given that some donors were foreign governments and corporations. “The inherent conflict of interest was obvious when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009,” the Globe wrote. “She promised to maintain a separation between her official work and the foundation, but recently released emails written by staffers during her State Department tenure make clear that the supposed partition was far from impregnable. ”    [Foreign governments gave millions to foundation while Clinton was at State]  The sentiment was echoed by Clinton ally and former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell in a recent interview with the New York Daily News. “It’d be impossible to keep the foundation open without at least the appearance of a problem,” Rendell said. The foundation, which was renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation after Hillary Clinton left the State Department, has operated since 1997 and expanded in subsequent years into an international charity. It has never previously restricted contributions from foreign citizens and companies or domestic corporations. After Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign in 2015, she stepped down from the board, and the foundation promised to disclose its donors more frequently and limit foreign governments that could donate to a select list engaged in particular projects. The foundation had also put in place certain restrictions on accepting donations from foreign governments while Clinton was secretary of state. It said it would seek State Department approval for any new foreign government donations or any substantial increase in donations from a preexisting government donor. But the rules did not prevent the foundation from accepting millions of dollars in foreign government donations while she was in office. A 2015 Washington Post report also revealed a government donation that was not properly submitted to the State Department for approval. According to a 2015 Post analysis of foundation donors, a third of contributors who had given more than $1 million were foreign governments or other entities based outside the United States.  Jose A.

214517,"Trump spokeswoman diagnoses Hillary Clinton with ‘dysphasia,’ despite not being doctor",Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-08-18,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160819001027/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/18/trump-spokeswoman-diagnoses-hillary-clinton-with-dysphasia-despite-not-being-doctor/,"The Trump campaign’s concerted effort to pump up questions about Hillary Clinton’s health using innuendo and unfounded speculation now includes an official diagnosis: dysphasia. A spokeswoman alleged Thursday that Clinton suffers from the language disorder, with which she has never been diagnosed. Katrina Pierson, whose command of the facts has been seriously called into question in recent weeks, appeared on MSNBC to answer questions about why the Trump campaign is going down this road, even as Clinton’s doctors say she’s healthy and that the conspiracy theories are bogus. Pierson argued: ”What’s new are the other reports of the observations of Hillary Clinton’s behavior and mannerisms, specifically with what you just showed in those previous clips, as well as her dysphasia, the fact that she’s fallen, she has had a concussion.” ”It’s something that needs to be addressed,” Pierson continued. ”She’s taken a lot of time off the campaign trail.” Dysphasia is defined as the ”loss of or deficiency in the power to use or understand language as a result of injury to or disease of the brain.” And Pierson isn’t the first to allege that Clinton has it. A doctor appearing on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show last week suggested that Clinton might have ”aphasia,” which is synonymous with dysphasia. ”I saw the same video you saw, and I’m wondering about a word called ’aphasia,’ where you’re searching for words, you suddenly lose those words, and that can be the sign, again, of some kind of traumatic brain injury or the   of a concussion,” Fox News medical correspondent Marc Siegel said. The segment has drawn heavy criticism, most notably from CNN media reporter Brian Stelter, who called it ”reckless speculation.” Pierson, of course, hasn’t been shy about passing along rumors or laughably misstating facts. Earlier this month, she accused President Obama of starting the war in Afghanistan and also said he was to blame for the death of Capt. Humayun Khan, the son of Democratic National Convention speaker Khizr Khan, in Iraq in 2004. Both happened before Obama was even a U. S. senator, much less president. Pierson in this case appears to be passing along the kind of conspiracy theory website content that has colored so much of the Trump campaign. The candidate himself once pointed to a National Enquirer story alleging that Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. While that was so ridiculous as to be laughable, Pierson’s dysphasia diagnosis is clearly part of a cynical effort to raise questions about Clinton’s health  —   an effort that is taking place outside the bounds of what’s generally been acceptable in a presidential campaign. The media has been forced to write about it and the Clinton campaign has been forced to respond to the conspiracy theories about her health  —   in large part because Donald Trump breathes life into them almost daily by pointing to Clinton’s lack of ”stamina” on the campaign trial. In previous elections, a candidate like Trump might have called on Clinton to release more medical records, but his campaign is instead unleashing a bevy of speculation and suggestion. Pierson’s diagnosis, given that history  —   and hers  —   should perhaps have been predictable."
214518,Hillary Clinton hasn’t held a press conference in 257 days. That’s ridiculous.,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-08-18,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160819001027/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/18/hillary-clinton-hasnt-held-a-press-conference-in-257-days-thats-ridiculous/,"Donald Trump said lots (and lots) of thing during his   town hall with Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Wednesday night.  This one  —   Trump talking about Hillary Clinton  —   stood out to me: She is so protected.  They are so protecting her. She hasn’t had a news conference in, like, 250 days. It couldn’t be that long since Clinton has talked to the press, I thought.  So, I went to the   tool that some guy named Philip Bump built to track how long it’s been since Clinton faced the press. And this is what I found:     Almost 258 days! Trump undersold something! Jokes aside, it’s beyond ridiculous that one of the two people who will be elected president in 80 or so days continues to refuse to engage with the press in this way. But she does   interviews! And she did a ”press conference” with a moderator, um, moderating the questions! Not good enough. Not when you are running to be president of the United States. One of the most important things when someone is offering themselves up to represent all of us is that we get the best sense we can about how that person thinks on his or her feet, how they deal with unwanted or adversarial questions. Those two traits are big parts of doing the job of president in the modern world. There’s nothing like a press conference to put a candidate for president through their paces. If you don’t believe me, just watch how Clinton handled this presser  —   not well!  —   when she tried to put the email server controversy to rest.    Clinton’s struggles with the press conference format are a major part of why she hasn’t done one in so long. Why do something you aren’t good at unless you absolutely have to? If campaigns are about downplaying your weaknesses while putting your strengths front and center, Clinton’s avoidance of press conferences is ”Campaigning 101.” There is also the fact that Clinton’s general election opponent continues to suck all of the oxygen  —   and then some  —   out of each day’s news cycle. Trump so dominates the coverage  —   and not in a good way  —   that there’s not enough room for Clinton’s unwillingness to face unscripted, unmoderated questions from reporters covering her to get much attention. Put all of that aside, and think of this: The last time Clinton held a press conference was Dec. 5, 2015.  That was before: 1. A single state had cast a vote in either a presidential primary or caucus 2. Major terrorist attacks in Nice, Brussels and Orlando 3. FBI Director James Comey issued his scathing report on Clinton’s email practices while at the State Department 4. The Bernie Sanders phenomenon 5. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was run out of the Democratic National Committee in the wake of a massive email   6. This whole Ryan Lochte international gas station incident The temperature in Washington on Dec. 5, 2015, was 44 degrees. It’s 84 today. A woman who conceived on Dec. 5, 2015, would be 8½ months pregnant today. On December 5, 2015, the Golden State Warriors were NBA champs. On December 5, 2015, I was still in my 30s. You get the idea. It’s been a long time. Lots of important things  —   Lochte and my 40th birthday being at the top of the list  —   have happened. Clinton is now the unquestioned favorite to be the 45th president of the United States  —   if you believe polling. The fact that she continues to avoid questions from the press is simply unacceptable given the office she is seeking and the stakes in this election.

214544,Hillary Clinton’s ‘Colin Powell did it’ defense of her email practices is just plain wrong,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-08-19,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160820000359/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/19/hillary-clintons-colin-powell-did-it-defense-of-her-email-practices-is-just-plain-wrong/,"The New York Times’ Amy Chozick has a great scoop today regarding Hillary Clinton’s email practices while she was secretary of state. Here’s the crux: Pressed by the F. B. I. about her email practices at the State Department, Hillary Clinton told investigators that former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had advised her to use a personal email account . .. Separately, in a 2009 email exchange that also emerged during the F. B. I. questioning, Mrs. Clinton, who had already decided to use private email, asked Mr. Powell about his email practices when he was the nation’s top diplomat under George W. Bush, according to a person with direct knowledge of Mr. Powell’s appearance in the documents, who would not speak for attribution. The implication here is clear: Clinton told the FBI that Powell advised her to use a private email account since he had done so while in the same job. Therefore, Clinton’s assertion that she was simply following the accepted practices of previous secretaries of state is entirely proven out. Done and done! Um, not really. Let me count the ways in which the Clinton email setup ≠ the Powell email setup: 1. Clinton exclusively used a private email account to conduct State Department business. Powell did not. 2. Clinton had a private email server, located at her house. Powell did not. 3. The rules governing electronic communication changed considerably  —   and got more strict  —   between Powell’s time in office and Clinton’s. This from the essential WaPo Fact Checker: After Powell left office in 2005, and through 2011, the State Department’s guidance for private email use was “considerably more detailed and more sophisticated. ” In 2002, there was a new requirement for email users to “determine the significance and value of information created on   systems [and] determine the need to preserve those messages that qualify as records. ” Rules for nongovernment information systems for the State Department were established in May 2004, toward the end of Powell’s tenure. Clinton’s email use should be evaluated in the context of the clearer guidance under her tenure, and the various memorandums “specifically discussing the obligation” for officials to use department systems in most circumstances, the report said. “Secretary Clinton’s cybersecurity practices accordingly must be evaluated in light of these more comprehensive directives,” the report said. Those rule changes  —   as well as the technological advancement made between 2005 and 2011  —   were at the center of Powell’s   statement in response to the ”Well, Colin did it” argument made by Clinton to the FBI. (Notice the ”at the time” caveat in the statement.)   Statement from Colin Powell’s office to NBC News —  after NYT @amychozick rpt on Clinton emails https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) August 19, 2016   The attempt to  —   again  —   equate what Powell did with what Clinton did is yet more evidence that either the candidate, her senior advisers or both simply don’t get it. No, Clinton wasn’t indicted by the Justice Department for her email setup. But she was badly reprimanded by FBI Director James Comey for her email practices; it was an unequivocal condemnation of her conduct in relation to her approach to electronic communications while serving as the country’s top diplomat. For whatever reason  —   and despite the fact that Clinton has said on several occasions that she knows she made a mistake  —   she seems incapable of accepting that responsibility and moving on. No secretary of state  —   up to and including Colin Powell  —   handled their email setup like Clinton. That’s a fact."
214611,Rudy Giuliani gets the street brawl with Hillary Clinton that he’s always wanted,Washington Post,Philip Rucker,M,2016-08-22,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160823000938/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rudy-giuliani-gets-the-street-brawl-with-hillary-clinton-that-hes-always-wanted/2016/08/22/1c21971e-687b-11e6-ba32-5a4bf5aad4fa_story.html,"Rudy Giuliani is finally running the race against Hillary Clinton that he first contemplated some 17 years ago: a brutish bout under a   spotlight. Only he’s doing it at the behest of his longtime friend Donald Trump. The former New York City mayor, who nearly ran against Clinton for the Senate in 2000, has emerged this summer as one of Trump’s most incendiary advocates and alter egos, channeling and feeding the Republican presidential nominee’s pugnacious instincts and dark suspicions. Together, Giuliani and Trump are turning an   campaign into a street brawl in keeping with their city’s political tradition  —   each man carrying personal grudges and considering no attack out of bounds. On Trump’s plane, in his private office and on the golf course, Giuliani has provided the candidate with counsel as well as Clinton stories and hearsay. In   fundraisers, the former U. S. attorney has introduced Trump with a prosecutorial case against Clinton’s record and character. And on television, he has relentlessly drawn attention to unsubstantiated theories about Clinton’s health.   Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, left, introduces Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a rally last week in Charlotte. (Brian   Images)  “I think Hillary’s tired. . . . She looks sick,” Giuliani said Monday on Fox News. The day before, he urged viewers of a separate Fox interview, “Go online and put down ‘Hillary Clinton illness.’ Take a look at the videos for yourself. ” Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted in response, “Google Rudy and health and you can read about how he withdrew from ’00 Senate race against Clinton. ” This was an apparent reference to Giuliani’s prostate cancer. For Giuliani, age 72 and more than a decade removed from office, this season of political rejuvenation has invited fresh controversy and a reevaluation of his legacy. Long celebrated as “America’s mayor”  —   a leader who after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks seemed to embody New York’s fearless and inclusive spirit  —   Giuliani has become a ubiquitous and unapologetic champion of Trump’s divisive, ethnically charged politics. In City Hall, Giuliani struggled at times to navigate race relations. As a Trump surrogate, he has defended some of Trump’s most inflammatory comments about Mexican Americans and hailed the GOP nominee’s proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Giuliani also has fashioned himself as an absolute protector of law and order, scolding the Black Lives Matter movement for putting “a target on the back of police. ” He appeared Monday afternoon at Trump’s side at a roundtable session with law enforcement leaders in Akron, Ohio, and then helped introduce him at a local rally.  [Donald Trump consults with Rudy Giuliani as he builds political kitchen cabinet]      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke about former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani’s crime policies during his speech on policing on Aug. 16. ”The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent,” he said. (The Washington Post)   Giuliani’s introductory remarks included a stinging indictment of Clinton, blaming her for the upheaval in Libya and for the 2012 terrorist attack on a U. S. compound there. “She was grossly negligent as secretary of state with the lives of our citizens,” Giuliani said. As the crowd chanted, “Lock her up! Lock her up! ,” Giuliani waved his hands dismissively. “No,” he shouted. “Beat her! Beat her! Beat her! Beat her! Beat her!”  Carl Paladino, an upstate New York businessman who ran unsuccessfully for governor and who has advised Trump, said Giuliani is “a respected litigator and leader” who can persuade “uninformed or   people on how to vote. ”   When a reporter mentioned Giuliani’s comments about Clinton’s health, Paladino said, “What’s wrong with that? I think he’s doing an excellent job in pointing out things about Hillary. How devious does a woman have to get?” Mike DuHaime, a veteran political adviser to Giuliani, said the former mayor’s combination of lawyerly mind set and “sheer joy” in political jousting have made him a   campaign surrogate. He said Giuliani is one of the few seasoned GOP figures Trump trusts as a peer. “Trump needs someone with Rudy’s background and gravitas by his side giving him credibility, especially since so many other Republicans have taken a walk on Trump,” DuHaime said.  Not everyone is so convinced about Giuliani’s effectiveness. “He sounds creepy and he sounds out of control,” said Hank  Sheinkopf, a New   Democratic strategist and former Clinton adviser. Asked about Giuliani’s presence in Trump’s campaign, George Arzt, a fixture in New York Democratic politics and former spokesman for the late mayor Edward Koch, said, “Oy, yoy, yoy. ” “He’s going out with all the conspiracies in the world to try to tar Hillary in a way that is not doing much for his reputation,” Arzt said. “He’s anathema to the values of most New Yorkers. ” Giuliani introduced Trump on Aug. 13 at a private fundraiser at the Hamptons beach home of New York Jets owner Woody Johnson. He repeated some of the fiery lines denouncing Clinton that he delivered at the Republican National Convention last month and blamed the former secretary of state in part for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, according to multiple people in attendance. Later that evening, Giuliani, Johnson and their wives went to dinner nearby at Nick and Toni’s, a   hot spot frequented by celebrities. The former mayor was seen walking through the bar sporting a white “Make America Great Again” cap.  [Rudy Giuliani’s exceptionally enthusiastic denunciation of Hillary Clinton annotated]  Trump’s friendship with Giuliani predates the 2016 campaign. They have been close since the 1980s, with intersecting social and professional circles in New York. Trump was a vocal supporter of Giuliani’s mayoralty and donated to his 2008 presidential campaign. Trump considers Giuliani a peer, unlike many of his other advisers, both formal and informal. Giuliani’s frenetic manner and his ease with tabloid New York politics make him a natural match for the celebrity businessman. Giuliani said he calls Trump often: “I’ll call him to say, ‘Donald, you’re going too far,’ or, ‘What you said was great,’ or, ‘Maybe change a bit,’” Giuliani said in a February interview. “It’s kind of a running conversation. There is candor and there is trust. ” Giuliani has been prone to effusive praise, even hyperbole, in evaluating Trump’s skills as a politician. He called a recent Trump speech on terrorism “the best speech that any Republican, at the least, has ever given. ” Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who has also been a confidant to Trump, said in an interview Monday that Giuliani’s “willingness to stick by Trump when Trump got in trouble” over the course of the past year “increased his impact on the total operation and Trump personally. ” Giuliani’s influence has extended to policy, Gingrich said, noting that the former mayor helped craft Trump’s speech last week in Wisconsin that touched on crime, policing and his pitch to black voters. Gingrich shrugged off Giuliani’s critics. “Democrats never liked Rudy in the first place. They never thought he was America’s mayor. They’ve been trying to undermine what he did in New York ever since he left. ” Patrick Oxford, a former law partner of Giuliani’s and chairman of his 2008 campaign, recalled golfing once with Trump and Giuliani in Palm Beach, Fla. and said their relationship is built on trust. “One of Rudy’s most attractive features is he is a very, very loyal friend,” Oxford said. “I am certain that the most important thing about Mr. Trump to Rudy is that he is his friend and may need help. ” Oxford explained Giuliani’s political bent as being in sync with two of his friends and fellow New York Republicans: Fox News anchor Sean Hannity and ousted Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, both of whom are informally advising Trump. “I think he fits very much into Fox News’s approach with respect to presidential politics,” Oxford said. “They’ve got a perspective on Democrats generally, and certainly on Hillary. ”"

Hillary’s problem is she has a casual relationship with the truth. The more people see her, the more they’re reminded of what they don’t like about her and what they don’t trust about her.” Frei smiled and said: ”You really don’t like her, do you?” ”No, it’s not about who I like,” Conway said. ”It’s like, look at the record. You think you would know who Hillary Clinton is if she weren’t married to Bill Clinton? Prove it.”   [Kellyanne Conway doesn’t like Donald Trump’s  ]   Conway’s comment was captured in a brief video clip that was first reported by BuzzFeed. It’s unclear when the interview occurred, although a partial transcript on a British news channel’s website indicates that it was while Conway was working for Trump’s campaign. Conway joined the campaign in July and became the campaign manager on Wednesday.      Speaking June 27 at the   luncheon in Chicago, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about the importance of earning the trust of voters who currently doubt her. (Reuters)   Conway has long been a critic of Clinton, and this is not the first time that she has brought up the former president’s infidelity. In April 2005, Conway said this on MSNBC: ”The fact is that Hillary Clinton could not stand up to a cheating husband, so how in the world would she stand up to North Korea and some of our other enemies around the globe?” In an interview on CNN’s ”State of the Union” on Sunday, Conway was asked to explain the comment. Conway defended what she said but clarified that she was not conflating marital problems with confronting hostile nations. ”The context of that particular comment, I don’t know what it was, but I will stand by in the following sense: I think people are looking for a strong, tough leader, and many American women have to make the choice that she made or have to make the opposite choice,” Conway said. ”But the fact is that people are looking for strength, and people are looking for leadership, and people will peruse all types of decisions you have made throughout your life.” Conway said that since she made that comment, Clinton served as secretary of state and showed how she would ”stand up to North Korea,” Iran and other countries. ”It turns out we know exactly how she would stand up to those powers,” Conway said. ”And it’s [a] very unimpressive record.”   [Inside Donald Trump’s strategy to win back women]   CNN’s Dana Bash pushed Conway to explain where she stands now. ”As you said, you made that comment a long time ago, but it sounds like you’re saying that those character traits that you’re discussing about her work at the State Department are the same that led to her staying with her husband?” Bash said. ”No, I am not saying that at all, nor should anybody presume that I am saying that. We don’t need to conflate the two,” Conway said. ”There are millions of women in this country who made the opposite choice, too. And that’s a right. My mother certainly did. She was left with a young child at the age of 26 with a high school degree, not a Yale Law School degree. And she certainly wasn’t first lady of the country and had to pull herself back up and find a way to support us. And God bless her. She did. So, no, let’s not conflate the two. But let’s really look at what Americans are seeking in the next president. They want leadership.”"
214651,"A guide to Hillary Clinton’s many ‘illnesses,’ as diagnosed in the conservative media",Washington Post,Callum Borchers,M,2016-08-23,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160824003648/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/23/a-guide-to-hillary-clintons-many-illnesses-as-diagnosed-in-the-conservative-media/,"Donald Trump has been saying for months that Hillary Clinton lacks the ”stamina” to be president. More recently, he has questioned whether the Democratic presidential nominee is ”all there.”         Those are pretty vague diagnoses, but the implications are clear: Clinton isn’t healthy enough to lead the country. Although Trump has stopped short of naming a specific illness that supposedly afflicts his opponent, his spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, asserted last week that Clinton suffers from dysphasia, and Trump allies in the media have many other theories about what ails the former secretary of state. So many theories. To be clear, Clinton does not have a perfect health record  —   no surprise for someone who has spent decades in   jobs and turns 69 in October. She has hypothyroidism, which hinders the thyroid’s production of a hormone that regulates metabolism and can cause fatigue. She takes a prescription blood thinner to guard against clots. She fainted four years ago after becoming dehydrated and suffered a concussion, which temporarily caused double vision. All of this is documented in a letter from Clinton’s physician released by her campaign last summer. And yes, Clinton is prone to coughing spells when speaking at length. She told NBC News in February that she drinks tea and uses a humidifier to fight that persistent tickle in her throat. But to hear some tell it, Clinton is on her death bed  —   actually, she should already be dead, according to the National Enquirer, which gave her six months to live last September. Clinton joked about the prediction on ABC’s ”Jimmy Kimmel Live” Monday night, asking the host to check her pulse during the interview to make sure she was still alive. The Washington Post Fact Checker last week awarded Trump (who is 70, by the way) four Pinocchios for his unsubstantiated ”stamina” argument, and The Post’s David Weigel recently debunked the ”junk science” behind some of the leading rumors of a dire, undisclosed health problem. But the extended list of alleged maladies is so long that it borders on comical. Here is The Fix’s guide to Clinton’s seemingly innumerable diseases and disorders, as diagnosed in the conservative press. Aphasia SEAN HANNITY: ”What about some of the weird pauses she has, the coughing fits she has? There are moments when I’m literally watching her and I’m thinking, okay, the facial expressions are odd. They seem off.” MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: ”Well, I don’t know this because I’m only looking at a video, but I saw the same video you saw and I’m wondering about a word called aphasia where you’re searching for words, you suddenly lose those words, and that could be the sign, again, of some kind of traumatic brain injury or the after effects of a concussion.” (Fox News Channel’s ”Hannity,” Aug. 9) Autism    Brain cancer   The National Enquirer is leading with ”Hillary Clinton: Brain Cancer Drama” pic. twitter.   —   Adam Henry (@viewofadam) December 30, 2012   Heart disease ”Hillary Clinton was seen wearing an object on her back under her green duster jacket.

How insane is it that Donald Trump and his surrogates are running around a giant Internet grassy knoll to unearth photos of Hillary Clinton stumbling on stairs and being propped up by pillows to prove that the former secretary of state is crumbling in plain sight? Seriously, these folks need hobbies. Or, better yet, everyone just take a look at this video put on Facebook by Eric Martin, who attended the fundraiser and campaign rally for Clinton in Provincetown, Mass. on Aug. 21.

(Eric Martin)   Seeing the cards tumble to the stage, Clinton goes from presidential candidate to stage mom as she walks over to help Rafanelli pick them up. After the unexpected assist, Rafanelli said to laughter, “That was cool, right? !” That’s rather alert and spry for a woman Trump said in a recent radio interview is “a mess, a total mess. ” Trump went on to tell host Hugh Hewitt that Clinton will “do an event, she’ll make a short speech off a teleprompter, and then she goes home and goes to sleep. ” Instead, the Martin video of the Sunday afternoon event reveal that Clinton spoke with no teleprompter for an extended period of time. We also know that after the event she jetted off to another fundraiser in another Cape Cod town.

214694,"After health care missteps, a chastened Hillary Clinton emerged",Washington Post,Amy Goldstein,F,2016-08-25,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160826002250/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-health-care-missteps-a-chastened-hillary-clinton-emerged/2016/08/25/2d200cb4-64b4-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html,"On a Saturday morning the summer of 1994, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was unnerved as she stood at a podium outdoors in downtown Seattle. Hundreds of demonstrators had infiltrated the crowd at a rally for a White House plan to redesign the U. S. health care system, their messages ugly and personal. The first lady faced signs saying “Heil Hillary,” and she could barely hear her own voice over the boos. Sensing trouble, her Secret Service detail had, for the first time that day, persuaded Clinton to wear, under her crimson jacket, a bulletproof vest.       The charged feelings about Clinton and health reform that had spread across the country were part of a spectacular downfall from a hopeful beginning 19 months earlier, when she and her husband, President Bill Clinton, moved into the White House determined to bring health insurance to every American. She seized an unprecedented role for a first lady, taking charge of a main policy initiative. Two months after the Seattle protests, the Clintons’ health reform quest was dead, having failed even to get a floor vote in either chamber of Congress.  From the ashes of this defeat emerged a chastened Hillary Clinton whose caution has, over the years and as she seeks to become the nation’s first female president, become a hallmark of her identity. The 21 months from the dawn to the demise of the Clinton health plan showed the first lady as the Washington neophyte that she was, overvaluing her own ideas, misreading power relationships, crusading for a complex plan that would have disrupted many Americans’ health care. She has not attempted anything so daring again. Years later, she crystallized her more cautious strategy. “I now,” she said in her 1999 U. S. Senate race, “come from the school of small steps. ” Brian Fallon, press secretary for her presidential campaign, said: “While Clinton herself would be the first person to acknowledge that there were missteps along the way, she absorbed key lessons from that experience and has applied them to all the fights she has waged since. ”   This story is based on interviews with two dozen insiders within the Clinton administration, on Capitol Hill and at leading interest groups, who interacted with the White House during that time. Some who now support Hillary Clinton are less critical of her today than in the past, and all agree that she alone cannot be held responsible for the failure; competing presidential priorities and a hardening partisan culture on Capitol Hill culture factored in, too.  To her credit, Clinton worked feverishly, demonstrated policy nimbleness and delivered impressive public performances. Yet, according to many who worked with her, she did not understand or respect the norms of Congress, was more prone to criticize than to negotiate, and allowed the process inside the White House to become unwieldy. She first drew criticism for a lack of openness that has dogged her in public life ever since. Privately, even some admirers of Clinton today view her health reform work as a case study in how not to function in political Washington.    First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton addressed a health care rally to push Congress to pass health care reform Aug. 16, 1994. The clock, which depicts one person losing health insurance every 1. 17 seconds, began Aug. 9 and was set to continue its count until health insurance reform was passed, according to Families USA Foundation. (Reuters)  Setting the stage During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton had targeted health reform as a top priority. After the election, health policy experts on his transition team fleshed out his chosen approach, called managed competition, to try to slow medical costs and foster universal coverage.  Then, on Jan. 11, nine days before inauguration, he summoned his health team to Little Rock to meet with him and his economic advisers. Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University health economist, remembers tripping over golf clubs in the governor’s mansion dining room, where they convened. He noticed that the  ’s wife was there.  Some team members thought they were in line for jobs leading the health reform effort. Yet as they presented cost estimates and unpleasant options  —   such as tax increases or government price controls  —   an old Clinton friend who had worked on the campaign, Ira Magaziner, assured Bill Clinton that his experts were wrong. The country, Magaziner said, could adopt managed competition without broad new taxes. Before their eyes, the team realized, Magaziner was securing a main White House health reform job  —   and they were not. Hillary Clinton asked only a few questions, recalled Atul Gawande, a medical student who had worked on the campaign. Rumors had been hovering that the first lady would have an unspecified role in the new administration. But “it became more apparent to me at that meeting that she was going to be in charge,” said Gawande, now a renowned writer, Harvard surgeon and public health researcher.  Un or tho dox as it was, the idea of the first lady taking part in governing flowed from the partnership the Clintons had forged during his Arkansas governorship. She had led his effort to improve the state’s public schools and, while she was not steeped in health policy, had worked on issues of children’s   and rural health. How hard Hillary Clinton pressed to oversee health reform depends on whom you ask.  Dick Morris, a former Clinton adviser who is now a critic, said the idea emerged from “a whole series of phone calls and a meeting at the governor’s mansion” with her. He said she first proposed becoming White House chief of staff  —   an idea Morris said he discouraged. She pondered attorney general or secretary of education, he said. Morris suggested she consider leading an important task force that would boost “her own credentials and her own accomplishments,” he said. However, in her autobiography, “Living History,” Clinton wrote that “Bill first broached the idea” of her leading a task force that would write the legislation and that she “didn’t run screaming from the room. ” A Clinton spokesman said she stands by her account. Both Clintons wanted business consultant Magaziner as the    manager, according to several people familiar with the decision. The huge task force would draft legislation.  Some incoming Cabinet members were skeptical. “I think everybody had a heart attack, because it was so contrary to the way anyone with experience” would set up the effort, Donna Shalala, the Health and Human Services   recalled in a 2007 oral history for the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. The task force idea, Shalala said, “was very much both” Bill and Hillary Clinton’s. The better arrangement, she said, would have been for the Clinton administration to design broad contours of a plan, then send them to Congress to take ownership and fill in the details. “A lot of us told him it was screwy . . . but when the President and the first lady decide they want to do something . . . unless it’s illegal you support it. . . . They had made up their minds. ” Today, Shalala is president of the Clinton Foundation. “Even her critics,” she said through a spokesman, “saw the qualities that make her such a strong advocate on these issues. ”        At a ceremony at the U. S. Capitol on Oct. 27, 1993,   of the House Tom Foley ( .) noted the ”remarkable” nature of   lady Hillary Clinton’s role in pushing for health care legislation being introduced later that day. ( )   Early optimism  The Saturday after her husband’s inauguration, Clinton convened the first White House   meeting with Magaziner and a trio of aides, her daily schedule shows. She already had broken ground, claiming, as no other president’s wife had, a West Wing office.  Two days later, with his wife seated next to him, Bill Clinton announced the President’s Task Force on National Health Reform and said it would submit legislation to Congress within his administration’s first 100 days. Its chair would be Hillary Clinton, he said, who “can bring people together around complex and difficult issues to hammer out consensus and get things done. ” Early on, her schedule shows, Clinton met with influential members of Congress. Her list one week included moderate Sen. Dave Durenberger ( .) a longtime advocate of universal health care who   a Senate GOP   bill. She talked with a   Democrats, among them Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( . Y.) chairman of the influential Senate Finance Committee, who wanted welfare reform to take precedence over changing the   system. And she went to Annapolis to speak at a retreat of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care. “Her skill set, it was like dealing with a thoroughbred horse with her,” said Chris Jennings, a White House aide who attended many of these sessions and now advises her campaign. Members of Congress interacting with Hillary Clinton, Jennings said, were “impressed with her” because of “her ability to know policy but also the history of the policy and the history of the member. ” “At that moment in time, she put out her hand, they put out their hand,” recalled Christine Ferguson, the   aide to  . John Chafee of Rhode Island, another moderate Republican who had long worked on health reform. “The one misstep,” said Ferguson, now a consultant, “may have been giving them a sense they would be part of the discussion, and there would be consultation. ” When Clinton called Durenberger for the first time, he decided to help her to understand “the nature of the trip we’d been taking since 1979 and what ticks off the partisan side of it. ” But he, like others, was mystified by the process she and Magaziner had created, with more than 500 task force members, divided into working groups with “tollgates” to assess ideas.   The first lady and Magaziner offended both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. They did not invite aides to GOP members to participate, and they showed no deference to committees handling health care —   or to members with seniority. The staff of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( .) a health reform crusader, decided to participate anyway. But Rep. Dan Rostenkowski ( .) the chairman of House Ways and Means, was among those who declined. “We didn’t call them up and say, ‘Hey you turkeys, we are not going to play in your sandbox.’ We just didn’t play in their sandbox. ” said David Abernethy, then a committee   aide. Others found the first lady dismissive of expertise. In a memo in his files, Moynihan recounts a comment made by health policy expert, Paul Ellwood, after meeting with Clinton. He said Ellwood told Moynihan’s chief of staff: “He had studied the subject all his life, she had studied the subject for three weeks, and already knows more than he. ” Ellwood, now 90, could not specifically recall the conversation but said: “It could well have been something that I said. ”  [Read the 1994 memo from  . Daniel Patrick Moynihan to himself.]  Kenneth Thorpe, who had served on the transition team, was by then working at HHS and still running cost estimates to present at   meetings with Magaziner that routinely ran until 1 a. m. “We would then periodically go in and brief Mrs. Clinton. She was basically the . . . leader of the band, orchestrating a lot of different decisions” in close consultation with her husband.  On the inside, some task force participants questioned their instructions to design “what we thought was the best system and not worry about politics. I have no idea where that came from  —   whether it was Ira or the president or the first lady. Any of us who had been involved in government or politics before thought it was very crazy,” said a   adviser who was involved and spoke on condition of anonymity to help preserve working relationships. “We kept waiting for the adults to come in and tell us to stop. ” On the outside, criticism mounted about secrecy. For two months, the White House refused to disclose names of task force members. Three organizations filed suit, alleging that closed meetings were illegal because some participants were not federal employees. The administration contended that the first lady was a “functional equivalent” of a federal employee, but a judge disagreed and ordered that some meetings be public. From the start, the president’s promise of a plan within 100 days was ambitious. Senate majority leader, George Mitchell ( ) urged swift action while Congress might be most receptive to a new administration, according to Christine Williams, Mitchell’s   policy aide. But a plan wasn’t ready. And Sen. Robert C. Byrd ( . Va.) the Senate’s parliamentary stickler, said that   changes couldn’t be part of budget legislation and would have to wait their turn. That winter and spring, Clinton privately vented frustrations. Her friend, Diane Blair, kept notes of their conversations. An April note in Blair’s files says Clinton was finding “Congress a bunch of whiners; no courage. ” By the end of May, the White House had missed its own deadline. The task force disbanded  —   in part because of the judge’s order. A smaller group, still led by Clinton and Magaziner, began drafting the legislation. The concept of managed competition that the Clintons espoused would create regional alliances through which everyone except older Americans would buy insurance. Many advocates of managed competition believed that competition among insurers inside the alliances would slow medical spending. The Clintons, uncertain that market forces alone would be enough, also called for the government to set an overall cap, if necessary. David Gergen arrived that summer as a senior adviser to the president. A veteran of three Republican White Houses, he quickly concluded that “they had misread how to get things done on the Hill,” he recalled. “The political theory was you should start with a proposal that pleases the left . . . and [through later negotiations] move to the center. That ran counter to everything I knew and others knew about how to succeed,” he said.  Shalala, the HHS secretary, was concerned, too. A   HHS secretary Peter Edelman recounted in another Miller Center oral history that Shalala: “was constantly going to the White House and saying to Hillary this or that about content and being rebuffed. . . . I remember one time Donna came back and said to me, ‘I told Hillary that this thing is just headed for disaster, and she told me I was just jealous that I wasn’t in charge and that was why I was complaining. ” Edelman, a Clinton supporter, declined to comment.  Clinton and Magaziner discounted   work already done by some members of Congress. Rep. Jim Cooper, a conservative Democrat from Tennessee, then still in his 30s, had introduced a bill in 1992 with similarities to the Clinton plan, though it did not compel employers to insure their workers or promise that insurance would be universal. Rather than reintroducing it, Cooper decided in early 1993 to offer it to the White House and, in June, went to the West Wing to meet with the first lady. He warned her that her approach might not pass the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee, on which he served. Cooper was quoted nearly a decade ago in the New York Times as saying that Clinton had replied, “We’ll crush you. ” Cooper told the newspaper, “I was excoriated. ”  Today, Cooper does not dispute the quotes, but his account has softened, and he now admires Clinton. “From her vantage point, she would have been entirely justified to think this junior pipsqueak had no idea what was going on,” he said. “I bet everyone else was telling her what she wanted to hear. ”   Cooper said he believes Clinton responded by helping to foment opposition to him in an unsuccessful Senate campaign. The president reacted much differently. Without ever lobbying him on   Bill Clinton invited him for two runs along the Mall, a round of golf and a visit in the White House residence that lasted so long that Cooper feared he would miss a flight for a speaking engagement in Nashville. The president said he would help out. When the 3 p. m. session arrived, Bill Clinton astonished the attendees  —   a gathering of Tennessee broadcasters  —   by phoning in. In late September, she helped to lead a   “  university” at the Capitol attended by hundreds of lawmakers, just before the president unveiled the White House plan in a televised speech to a joint session of Congress. The legislation still wasn’t ready.  The next week, his wife made history, testifying before the Ways and Means Committee as the lead witness on a major White House initiative. Within days, she testified before four more committees. Her appearances were heralded as a tour de force.     First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton holds up a pamphlet entitled “Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery” while testifying on Capitol Hill before the House Energy Committee, Sept. 28, 1993. (Associated Press)  Off Capitol Hill, Hillary Clinton rebuffed a leading trade group trying to negotiate with her. The Health Insurance Association of America agreed with the Clintons’ idea that employers must cover their workers but opposed the idea of people buying insurance through regional alliances. In August, the group launched its memorable “Harry and Louise” advertising campaign, with a couple suggesting “there has got to be a better way” than the Clinton plan. Charles N. Kahn III, then the HIAA executive vice president and now president of the   hospital trade group, said the ads were intended “to get the attention of the administration so they would negotiate. ” The strategy didn’t work. The group had earlier had unsatisfactory interactions with Magaziner, and now Clinton declined to meet. The ads resurfaced and eventually were cited as a reason health reform failed.      Here’s a look back at a series of ads surrounding the Clinton health care reform, launched in 1993, and a spoof the president and first lady showed at the 109th Gridiron Dinner. (Sarah   Washington Post)   In late October, the day after her 46th birthday, Clinton spoke along with her husband in the U. S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall for the ceremonial introduction of the Clintons’ Health Security Act. But the legislation still wasn’t quite ready. It was almost Thanksgiving before Mitchell introduced the bill.  The bill was 1, 342 pages  —   so intricate that some health policy gurus said they couldn’t fully understand it. Cooper had by then reintroduced his plan. And Congress was about to go home for the year. A slow death   By 1994, the Clintons’ second year in the White House, the mood was souring as five House and Senate committees began considering bills. Opposition was hardening among some interest groups, including the insurance industry, and Republicans. House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich ( .) saw an opportunity to end the Democrats’ majority.     House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich ( .) holds a copy of President Clinton Health Security Act during a news conference at Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 27, 1993. (Greg   Press)  In early spring, Senate centrists, Democrat and Republican alike, formed a Mainstream Coalition to press for a more modest reform. Durenberger, part of the group, remembers 27 senators taking part, including “people who’d spent a good share of their Senate lives on this. ”  By May, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole ( .) handed a note to Moynihan, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, suggesting that they map out a compromise.  Gergen recalled a phone call from Moynihan, urging the White House to loosen in its insistence on achieving universal coverage right away. Moynihan reminded Gergen that great advances in the nation’s social safety net  —   including Social Security and Medicare  —   had been passed by large congressional majorities of a kind the Clinton plan simply did not have. Again, the first lady was reluctant to compromise. On a Sunday night in June, the eve of an appearance by the president on NBC television’s “Today Show,” Gergen was in the White House Map Room with the president, first lady and other aides to decide if the president should signal that he was open a gradual   of universal coverage. “The question was put to the president and first lady,” Gergen recalled. “She was very opposed to incrementalism. ” Gergen looked at his watch and jotted down: “At 10:22 p. m. tonight, health care died. ” Health reform sputtered along for another three months. Conservative radio talk show hosts bashed it  —   and the Clintons in general. Seattle was not the only city in which bus caravans called the Health Security Express, filled with “reform riders” who supported the White House plan, encountered protests. In Owensboro, Ky. an effigy with a tag reading, “I’m Hillary,” was hung from a wooden frame, doused in gasoline, and burned. Near the end, the White House worked with Mitchell on a compromise, but Congress  —   even the Democrats  —   had fractured. Mitchell declared health reform dead in late September.  Republicans, led by Gingrich, used “Hillarycare” as part of their case to win a House majority that fall. Clinton, in “Living History,” recalls meeting with aides to share her disappointment. “Fighting back tears, my voice cracking, I poured out apologies,” she wrote. “I told them I was considering withdrawing from active political and policy work. ” She had canceled an appearance that night at the Mayflower Hotel. At her aides’ coaxing, she reconsidered and decided to attend. Then, two day after Christmas, she and her team drafted a letter for the president to send to Gingrich, the incoming House speaker, saying that the White House should work together with the new Congress on health reform’s “first steps. ”  [Read the 1994 letter drafted by Clinton and her team to Newt Gingrich.]  Hard lessons In 1999, during the final weeks of her campaign to succeed Moynihan as a senator from New York, Clinton sent him a note, according to the book, “Daniel Patrick Moynihan, A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary. ” “If I had listened to you about health care in 1994,” said her handwritten note on White House stationery, “I would be far better off today  —   but more importantly  —   so would the nation’s health care system. ”    First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton talks to members from the XYZ (Extra Years of Zest) Seniors group of Arlington, Va. on Dec. 6, 1993, in the Oval Office of the White House. (Doug   Press)  From time to time, Clinton has discussed what she learned. She suggests that she and her husband attempted too much too fast. When she first ran for president in 2008, she reflected on “some valuable lessons” as she proposed a new health care plan. Clinton said that change must be less disruptive, allowing those who like their coverage to keep what they have.  Fallon, her campaign spokesman, noted that, after 1994, she “dusted herself off” and worked for the passage of significant but piecemeal legislation to insure   children. Her role was largely behind the scenes.  The common wisdom today is that the Clintons’ failure shaped the nation’s next big attempt  —   the Affordable Care Act that President Obama pressed through a polarized Congress in 2010.  Two years before its passage, Durenberger, the former Minnesota senator, organized a weekend retreat for some old hands from the Clinton health reform days. It was April, before the 2008 election season had produced nominees. The guests, friends and foes of the Clintons’ efforts, traipsed through a late spring snow to a conference center, where they produced “10 commandments for presidential leadership on health reform. ” The commandments do not mention first ladies. But they read like a takedown of Hillary Clinton’s missteps. They urge the White Houses to not get into “the policy weeds,” to delegate legislative details to Congress, and to manage partisanship by “fertilizing the middle. ”  Durenberger’s wife, Susan Foote, was his health policy adviser during the Clinton days and helped plan the retreat. Several months afterward, with Obama elected but not sworn in, with the Affordable Care Act battles lying ahead, she got a call from Ezekial Emanuel, one of the new president’s health care advisers. He had heard there was an unpublished list of how to do better than the Clintons had. He wondered if he might have a copy."
214696,A new poll showing Hillary Clinton up 10 points gives insight into why Donald Trump’s campaign is faltering,Washington Post,Philip Bump,M,2016-08-25,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160826002250/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/25/a-new-poll-showing-hillary-clinton-up-10-gives-insight-into-why-donald-trumps-campaign-is-faltering/,"A new survey from Quinnipiac University shows Hillary Clinton with a   lead over Donald Trump, with more than half of respondents preferring her candidacy. ”We are starting to hear the faint rumblings of a Hillary Clinton landslide,” the assistant director of the poll wrote in his summary, which of course is the sort of thing that is currently being passed around Clinton’s headquarters in Brooklyn to   giddiness. But this is one poll, and we don’t get excited about the   numbers from one poll, because we are not the Hill. As Nate Silver put it on Twitter, recent polls have been ”a cherrypicker’s delight,” since some (like the Los Angeles   poll) have showed a close race and others, like this one, have shown a   one. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls, Clinton’s back to a   lead, in the range where she’s been since shortly after the conventions.     (RealClearPolitics hasn’t incorporated another new poll just out from PRRI, which shows Clinton up by 13 points.) What we can learn from the Quinnipiac poll is what’s changed since their last survey, conducted at the end of June. In that poll Clinton led 42 to 40. Now, she leads 51 to 41. As a result, plotting the margins of support for Clinton over Trump by demographic, most of them have shifted to the left  —   meaning that the margin by which Clinton leads has grown or the margin by which Trump leads has shrunk.     We see that this holds true by party. In June, 6 percent of Republicans said they’d back Clinton; that jumped to 12 percent. The percent saying they’d back Trump didn’t move.     Interestingly, Trump saw an erosion of support from white men but not white women (who already favored Clinton). Overall, Trump leads with whites by 11 points (down from 13 in June) and trails among nonwhites by 62 points. Overall, Clinton’s lead with women increased by seven points, and Trump’s lead with men shrank by the same amount.     The oldest and youngest voters were the ones who moved the most toward Clinton, by 12 and 10 points respectively.     But why did Trump’s support slip? Well, at the same time that Clinton’s margin in the polls grew by eight points, Clinton’s net favorability (those who view her favorably minus those who view her unfavorably) grew by eight points as Trump’s fell by five. More than half of voters now say they have a strongly unfavorable view of the businessman  —   not the direction he’d want to go.     President Obama is viewed favorably by 54 percent of respondents, a good sign for Clinton.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told   in Tampa on Aug. 24 that ”the polls with African American folks and   folks, the Hispanics, Latinos, have gone way up” in the last three weeks. (The Washington Post)   The pollsters also asked whether respondents felt that Trump’s campaign rhetoric appeals to bigotry. Well over half, 59 percent, said that it did. Even worse for Trump, a plurality of every demographic save Republicans felt that he appealed to bigotry, including majorities of independents, men, women, whites with or without college degrees, people aged 64 or younger and both whites and nonwhites. Among all whites, 54 percent felt that Trump appeals to bigotry (with 50 percent of white men agreeing). Among nonwhites, the figure was 72 percent. (With 29 percent of Republicans saying they think he appeals to bigotry and 84 percent supporting him, that means that at least 13 percent of Republicans both think he appeals to bigotry and plan to give him their vote.)     Interestingly, Trump is seen as more honest than Clinton in this poll. That’s unusual; most polls show them at about the same level. But Clinton makes up for that by being seen as more experienced, levelheaded and qualified  —   by big margins (39, 37 and 26 points, respectively). More than half of respondents said that, no, those terms don’t apply to Trump in each case.     Trump has hinged his election on being seen as a change agent. And, sure enough, 46 percent figure that things wouldn’t change much if Clinton wins the presidency. But 46 percent of respondents think that the change Trump would bring is the wrong change, which isn’t really the framing Trump would like to see. If nothing else, the story of this poll should be that even several weeks after they ended, Trump hasn’t done much to shift the way the conventions set the race. This poll shows a bigger gap than most but most polls show a gap in her favor to some extent. The details of the new poll show why: Trump simply isn’t seen as presidential material by most Americans. Clinton’s Brooklyn team will probably be giddy about that, too.              Caption   The Democratic presidential nominee hits the road after her party’s national convention.

214733,‘Dr. Drew’ show canceled days after host’s negative speculation about Hillary Clinton’s health,Washington Post,Fred Barbash,M,2016-08-26,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004939/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/08/26/dr-drew-show-canceled-days-after-his-negative-speculation-about-hillary-clintons-health/,"Drew Pinsky’s    HLN show, “Dr. Drew On Call,” has been canceled by CNN, effective Sept. 22. In a statement, CNN executive vice president Ken Jautz said he and Pinsky “have mutually agreed to air the final episode of his show on September 22″ but gave no specific reason for the cancellation. CNN Money, in its reporting of the announcement, connected it to a broader shakeup at HLN, including the end of Nancy Grace’s flamboyant show devoted to criminal court cases. But the decision came eight days after Pinsky’s comments on a radio show on Aug. 17 questioning the health and medical care of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president. After looking at bits and pieces of Clinton’s   records she made public in 2015, he said he was “gravely concerned not just about her health, but her health care. ” His comments came as the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, along with its surrogates and supporters, including former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Fox News host Sean Hannity, have attempted to portray Clinton as lacking “the mental and physical stamina” demanded by the job, as Trump has put it. Pinsky’s views, which he said were shared by another physician with whom he had consulted, aired on KABC’s “McIntyre in the Morning. ” The episode has been removed from the station’s website, but a transcript was published by the conservative Washington Free Beacon: Based on the information that she has provided and her doctors have provided, we were gravely concerned not just about her health, but her health care   …    . What is going on with her health care? It’s bizarre. I got to tell you. Maybe they have reasons, but at a distance, it looks bizarre. There ought to be some sort of standard for people that are going to lead the country or are going to making these important decisions. Again, Hillary may be fine with all of this. I mean, it’s dangerous and it’s concerning, but you can see —  and by the way, there were two other things that gravely concerned us. When she hit her head, she had to wear these prism glasses when she came out.   …    . That is brain damage, and it’s affecting her balance. Now clearly, it hasn’t affected her cognition, but tell us a little more about that. That’s profound. And then number two, when they screened her for heart disease, again, they did an   screen. It just seems like she’s getting care from somebody that she met in Arkansas when she was a kid, and you’ve got to wonder. You’ve got to wonder. It’s not so much that her health is a grave concern. It’s that the care she’s getting could make it a concern. He based his comments on a July 2015 letter from Lisa Bardack, an internist in Mount Kisco, N. Y. who has served as Clinton’s doctor for 15 years. The   letter described Clinton as “a healthy    female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies. ”      Twice this week, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump went after Democrat Hillary Clinton for her physical health. Here’s how that claim checks out. (Sarah Parnass, Julio Negron, Osman   Washington Post)   As The Post’s Fact Checker noted, the letter disclosed that Clinton suffered from deep vein thrombosis in 1998 and in 2009, an elbow fracture in 2009 and, most notably, a concussion in 2012. (The elbow injury and concussion, when she was secretary of state, were extensively reported at the time.) The letter says her concussion symptoms, including double vision, were resolved within two months. The letter concluded that Clinton “is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States. ” It was Pinksy’s second foray into the subject of Hillary Clinton’s health, and the first one ended badly, as well. In January, he made reference   to Clinton’s late return to the stage in a debate and cited a Breitbart News story, attributed to a “strong source,” suggesting that it was due to “a   of problems from” a “brain injury. ” In fact, she had only visited the restroom. He apologized after the broadcast. “Earlier tonight, I mistakenly raised an anonymously sourced report about Hillary Clinton’s health. By doing so, I violated HLN and CNN’s editorial standards and I was wrong to have mentioned the unsubstantiated report. I regret the error and will make sure, in the future, to apply the rigorous editorial standards we have in place here. I apologize to our viewers and Secretary Clinton for falling short tonight. ” “Dr. Drew and his team have delivered more than five years of creative shows and I want to thank them for their hard work and distinctive programming,” Jautz said in a statement Thursday. “Their   shows, in particular, were innovative and memorable TV. And Dr. Drew has been an authoritative voice on addiction and on many other topical issues facing America today. ” Drew’s website describes him as “America’s most trusted physician” who “explores the behavior behind the headlines and addresses the fundamental issue, ‘why we do what we do.’ ” Until earlier this year, Pinsky also hosted a nationally syndicated radio show called Loveline."
214771,Hillary Clinton had the chance to make gay rights history. She refused.,Washington Post,Robert Samuels,M,2016-08-28,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160829002721/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/hillary-clinton-had-the-chance-to-make-gay-rights-history-she-refused/2016/08/28/843a5cfc-58cf-11e6-9767-f6c947fd0cb8_story.html,"During her first run for president in 2008, Hillary Clinton had an opportunity to become an undisputed leader in the gay rights movement. As she prepared for a forum on the   Logo network, she reached out to her friend Hilary Rosen, a political consultant who is a lesbian. Rosen expressed frustration that so many mainstream political figures opposed legalized   marriage, and she challenged Clinton to speak out for a community that had strongly supported her. Clinton refused. “I’m struggling with how we can support this with a religious and family context,’’ Rosen recalled Clinton telling her. Clinton just wanted to know the best way to explain the position.   Hilary Rosen, at left in 2013 in New York, said she was disappointed that her friend Hillary Clinton did not vocally support   marriage in 2008. (Amy   )  The exchange was painful for Rosen, who had known Clinton since they worked on children’s issues together in the 1980s. “We took it personally,” Rosen said. “You try not to because it’s politics, but in this case, the politics is personal. ” Clinton eventually got where her friends wanted her to go, though her change of heart came when the political risk had disappeared  —   close to a year after similar shifts by President Obama and Vice President Biden. This year, as the Democratic presidential nominee, she is running as a forceful advocate for the LGBT community’s agenda and a   supporter of   marriage. The country’s leading gay rights group, the Human Rights Campaign, endorsed her early in the campaign, lauding her as a “champion” for its cause. Clinton’s path to get to this point frustrated many of her supporters. While most national politicians have been slow to evolve on gay marriage, Clinton’s handling of it was particularly saddening to some activists because they had expected more. Clinton and her husband, Bill, had stood out as being among the first to actively court the gay community as an interest group and donor base  —   and yet they were unwilling to stand with the community on one of its biggest civil rights issues. “You could see the powerful way she has leveraged her influence on behalf of women and children or other issues,” said Alan van Capelle, a former director of the   Empire State Pride Agenda. “In terms of LGBT rights and marriage, there were people who led and people who followed. And on that issue, she followed. ” Clinton’s approach to   marriage illustrates the caution that has come to define her political career. It also reflects a central challenge for the    candidate, who along with her husband helped to shape an era of centrist politics designed to appeal to culturally conservative voters but has struggled to adapt to a generation of Democrats who have moved further to the left.   Senate candidate Hillary Clinton responds to a   protester who interrupted her remarks to the Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats in New York in March 2000. (Bebeto   Press)  Among the Bill   policies that Hillary Clinton has disavowed on the presidential campaign trail is the Defense of Marriage Act, the law signed by   Bill Clinton in the   to his 1996 reelection effort that prohibited the federal government from recognizing   marriage.  As Bill Clinton sought the 1992 Democratic nomination, LGBT activists were eager to align with the Clintons. The community had a strained relationship with the previous Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis, whom activists heckled at a campaign event when he said he didn’t see the need to issue an order banning discrimination against gays in the federal government. Bill Clinton sought to include the community as a part of his coalition. He thrilled hundreds when he spoke at an LGBT fundraiser at the Palace nightclub in West Hollywood. “I have a vision and you’re a part of it,” Bill Clinton told the crowd, recalled Richard Socarides, who advised the Clinton White House on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. He spoke about increasing funding for AIDS research and ending discrimination against gay men and lesbians. Most provocative was his unequivocal promise to lift the ban on gay people serving in the military. He didn’t speak about marriage, which had not yet emerged as a major political issue. As Bill Clinton focused on policy, Hillary Clinton developed friendships with LGBT activists. She would talk with   couples about their children and share stories of parenthood. She’d acknowledge staffers with a smile if she saw them holding hands with their partners at their church and was comfortable asking for details about relationships. The night before Roberta Achtenberg, then a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, was scheduled to make history at the 1992 Democratic National Convention as the first openly lesbian person to ever address the gathering, Hillary Clinton called to give her a pep talk. “I’m rooting for you,” Achtenberg recalled Clinton saying. In 1993, Bill Clinton’s first year in office, relations began to fray. Members of Congress and military officials were arguing against lifting the ban on gays serving in the military. Many strategists thought the president didn’t have the political capital to push through his idea, so he had to compromise. The result was the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which allowed gay men and women to serve in the military as long as they were not open about their sexual orientation. Those who spoke to Hillary Clinton at the time said she encouraged her husband to find more support in Congress to avoid the compromise. But there was little she could do. “Bill knew the issue was a political loser,” she wrote later in her 2003 autobiography, “Living History. ” Three years after “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the president faced another question about gay rights. Lawmakers were crafting legislation mandating that the federal government recognize only heterosexual marriage. Some White House strategists worried that if Clinton didn’t back the legislation, he might lose the support of the centrists who had helped propel him to the White House in the first place. LGBT staffers tried to change the president’s mind. Hillary Clinton, whose influence had dwindled after her failed attempt to overhaul the   system, mostly stayed out of those discussions, Socarides said. Still, some gay activists hoped that she might be a voice for them in the West Wing. Rosen, who at the time headed the recording industry trade association, asked Clinton whether she could help change her husband’s mind. Hillary Clinton was not receptive, Rosen recalled, because she thought she needed to stand with her husband while making tough choices. “No one said it was going to be easy,” Rosen said she told her, “but politicians have to make decisions. Someone has to be first. ” When the president signed DOMA, activists were livid. “It was like a dagger to the heart,” Rosen reflected. “And at that point, it made supporting his reelection very difficult. ” Still, with Republican leadership threatening to take away funding for AIDS research, the Clintons offered the best opportunity to have any influence at all. Rosen and other gay rights activists hoped that Hillary Clinton might undo some of her husband’s legacy when she started to run for the Senate. Clinton’s potential opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, had made inroads with the city’s affluent gay community, opposing the military’s ban on openly gay members. Clinton followed suit, announcing at a fundraiser in the SoHo art studio of a gay donor that she, too, was against “don’t ask, don’t tell. ” “Fitness to serve should be based on an individual’s conduct, not their sexual orientation,” Clinton said in a statement the next evening. A month later, she demonstrated the limits to her support for LGBT rights  —   declaring that she was unwilling to support legalized marriage. “Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and woman,” she said during a January 2000 news conference. Giuliani dropped out of the race, but Clinton’s embrace of the gay community carried on. She spoke in favor of civil unions gaining equal legal status as marriage, as well as efforts to end employment discrimination against homosexuals. In June 2000, she strolled along Fifth Avenue behind a man on roller skates wearing only a thong and another in a pink tutu. Waving along to onlookers shouting, “I love you,” Clinton became the first first lady to walk in the city’s raucous gay pride parade. Yet, as she was celebrating   relationships, some activists in New York were losing patience. In 2004, the mayor of San Francisco started approving marriage licenses for   couples. Courts in Massachusetts had endorsed marriage rights. President George W. Bush called for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, energizing a conservative base that would help him secure a second term. Clinton said she opposed amending the Constitution but said in a Senate floor speech that she took “umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage or to the fundamental bedrock principle that it exists between a man and a woman. ” Clinton’s perpetual balancing act unnerved some supporters. When Clinton began holding fundraisers for her Senate reelection campaign in 2006, van Capelle urged gay donors to withhold their checks because “she didn’t earn it. ” “If an environmental group [had] asked me to write a check for Hillary I would, and if reproductive rights group asked I would,” van Capelle said. “There was a strange relationship between politicians and fundraisers, and they thought they could use [LGBT activists] as an ATM machine and we didn’t want to be a part of it. I thought it set a bad example. What it said was you could do as little as you could at that time to get our support. ” Clinton’s position was softening. She supported states that legalized   marriage. As for her position on the federal ban, her staff noted that her position was in a “state of evolution. ” Rosen, her longtime friend, said she pleaded with Clinton to stop discussing marriage in religious terms. The position seemed dogmatic and uncompromising, Rosen said. “I encouraged her just to say she’s not fully comfortable with it,” Rosen said. Some of Clinton’s allies tried to avoid the issue entirely. Allida Black, a historian and longtime friend, said she chose to focus her conversations with Clinton on pressing for policies to allow gay people to visit their partners in the hospital or bury their deceased loved ones. Nevertheless, Black said she never doubted that Clinton respected her relationship with her partner, Judy. “You trusted her because of the way she treated us,” Black said. Jason Collins, a professional basketball player who became friends with Chelsea Clinton while living in Wilbur Hall with her at Stanford University, marveled at how comfortable Bill and Hillary were dancing among gay couples at an ’80s prom that Chelsea had in the West Village to celebrate her 30th birthday in 2010. “Chelsea kept a diverse inner circle,” Collins said, “and you know that probably had an effect on her parents’ thinking. ” When Collins decided he was ready to become the first major professional athlete to come out in 2013, he looked to Bill and Hillary Clinton for advice. “There’s going to be a moment where everything is going so fast it feels like it’s moving at a million miles per second,” Collins recalled Hillary Clinton telling him. “At those moments, just take a breath, and keep going forward. ” As secretary of state, Clinton allowed   partners of Foreign Service officers the same travel benefits at married couples. She gave a speech in Geneva in 2011 in which she said, “Gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights,” an echo of the women’s rights speech she had delivered in China as first lady. By May 2012, as polls showed more than half of the country supporting   marriage, top Democrats began indicating their support. Biden declared in a television interview that he was “absolutely comfortable” with   marriage. Obama followed soon after, saying that “  couples should be able to get married. ” Clinton stayed silent. Chad Griffin, the executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, said he privately pressed Clinton to shift her position. Griffin, who grew up in Hope, Ark. writing letters to   first lady Hillary Clinton, said her resistance on   marriage was “really hard. ” Months after Obama’s statement of support, Griffin ran into Clinton on an Amtrak barreling from New York to Washington. She told him she wanted his ideas for the best way to show her support for   marriage. Griffin said he had long known that she would come around eventually, but “the moment felt like such a relief. ” In 2013, before the Supreme Court struck down a key part of DOMA, Clinton released a video with the Human Rights Campaign stating that she had reconciled her feelings. She was fully behind marriage. Black, now a fundraiser for Clinton, could only smile when she saw Clinton’s video. But she had known it was coming. After she married her partner, Judy, in April 2012  —   nearly a year before Clinton’s public announcement  —   Black came home to a note attached to her door. It was from Clinton. “At long last!” it read."
214836,Cartoonist who drew Hillary Clinton in blackface: ‘I fail to see the racism’,Washington Post,Callum Borchers,M,2016-08-30,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160831002640/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/30/cartoonist-who-drew-hillary-clinton-in-blackface-i-fail-to-see-the-racism/,"This post has been updated to include a reference to a second blackface cartoon by a different artist. After posting a cartoon Monday that depicts Hillary Clinton in blackface, pastor Mark Burns, a Donald Trump surrogate, quickly deleted the image from his Twitter account and apologized for spreading it. But the cartoonist who drew it, Tony Branco, is standing by his caricature. ”Political cartoons are supposed to rile people up, get people talking, have a discussion about issues,” Branco told me. ”It’s supposed to focus people’s attention on the issue, and that’s what the cartoon did. And I’m pretty proud that it did that.”   [Black pastor, a Trump surrogate, apologizes for tweet showing Clinton in blackface]   The issue, as Branco sees it, is that Clinton and her fellow Democrats pander to African Americans. He didn’t think the cartoon was particularly controversial when he drew it, back in April. In fact, when I called him Tuesday morning, he initially could not even remember what prompted it. (Branco later recalled being inspired by an interview, conducted by the black hosts of the ”Breakfast Club” radio show, in which Clinton said she carries hot sauce in her purse  —   hence the ”No hot sauce, no peace!”   sported by the Democratic presidential candidate in the sketch. Clinton has a     affinity for hot sauce; then again, her remark sure sounded like a reference to a Beyoncé song. Clinton and the ”Breakfast Club” hosts joked that pandering charges would surely follow.)   [How did hot sauce get in so many African Americans’ bags, anyway?]   Branco explained his decision to draw Clinton in blackface like this: ”Putting her in blackface  —   well, it wasn’t exactly blackface; it was more of a picture of her trying to fit in with black people and insult their intelligence. . .. I was just trying to point out in my way that she was pandering to black people, trying to fit in with black people. It’s no more complicated than that.” Louisville   cartoonist Marc Murphy portrayed Trump in blackface earlier this month, but so far no prominent Clinton surrogates have thought it wise to tweet the image. Branco, a conservative cartoonist, said he preferred other Republican presidential candidates, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, over Trump. But he will vote for the real estate mogul. He even sounds a bit like Trump. On African Americans: ”Why do you keep voting for Democrats when your life never improves and your situation never improves? Why don’t you try something else? Give it a shot.” On political correctness: ”People are so politically correct now that you can’t even present a cartoon and look at the intent of the cartoon. If you want to know the intent of the cartoon, ask the cartoonist, and I guess that’s what you’re doing now.” On the media: ”The media would rather turn this into a racist issue and try to focus on the fact that ’it’s blackface, oh, it’s blackface,’ and not even look at the fact that she’s been pandering for years, like many Democrats, to black people, and their situation hasn’t changed whatsoever. That’s my take on it. I fail to see the racism in it. You have to really work hard to draw the conclusion that it’s racist.” Branco is familiar with the racist history of blackface, ”but it’s 2016. Come on. And it’s a political cartoon.” Is he saying Clinton is racist? ”I’m labeling Hillary Clinton as a panderer, a panderer to the black community. That’s what I’m labeling her as. . .. Not necessarily a racist. I don’t know about her heart.” Branco said it is unfair to hold Trump responsible for the cartoon, because the candidate did not draw it or tweet it from his own account. The media, Branco said, is ”trying to twist it into ’Trump is a racist. ’” That’s how the mainstream press operates, he believes. With that in mind, will he be more cautious in his cartooning  —   just in case Trump is held responsible for another provocative illustration by Branco? ”I don’t think so,” he said. ”I’m going to continue to present the truth as I see it.”      Trump supporter and pastor Mark Burns apologized after tweeting a contentious image of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in blackface. Here’s a look at some of the other Trump surrogates who’ve made headlines this campaign cycle. (Jenny   Washington Post)"
214863,A record number of Americans now dislike Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-08-31,2016.0,8.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160901001401/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/31/a-record-number-of-americans-now-dislike-hillary-clinton/,"Hillary Clinton hit her stride after the Democratic National Convention, riding to a   lead over Donald Trump in some national and   polls  —   her highest of the year. As of today, though, Americans’ views of her just hit a record low. A new Washington   News poll shows 41 percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Clinton, while 56 percent have an unfavorable one. That’s the worst image Clinton has had in her   in national public life. Her previous low favorable rating this year was in July, when it was 42 percent, lower than any mark in historical   polls except a few points in the 1990s when a large share of the public had no opinion of her. Her previous high for unfavorable views was in June, when 55 percent disliked Clinton.     Trump, of course, has long been the more unpopular of the two presidential nominees, and he remains so; 35 percent of Americans have a favorable impression of him, compared to 63 percent unfavorable. But if you look just at registered voters, the new poll actually shows Clinton’s image is about as bad as Trump’s, with 38 percent having a favorable impression and 59 percent unfavorable, compared to a   split for Trump.     Clinton’s numbers serve as a reminder that Trump’s unpopularity isn’t prohibitive, largely because Americans  —   and specifically registered voters  —   don’t much like Clinton either. If it weren’t for Trump, in fact, Clinton would be the most unpopular   presidential nominee in modern American history. Perhaps most notably, Clinton’s image has declined significantly from just a month ago. After the Democratic convention, Americans were about evenly split  —   48 percent favorable and 50 percent unfavorable. [WATCH: 6 voters explain why they’ve already made up their minds about the 2016 election] Interestingly, Clinton’s numbers appear to have dropped since that early August poll mostly in groups that have been very supportive of her:  Her favorable rating among women dropped from 54 percent to just 45 percent. Among Hispanics, it went from 71 percent to 55 percent. Among liberals, it went from 76 percent to 63 percent.  It’s not clear quite what might have caused Clinton to fall further than ever before. It’s likely that she simply got an extended bounce after the Democratic convention that has finally faded. It’s also possible that adverse headlines last week about the Clinton Foundation and thousands of newly discovered emails from the private email server Clinton used as secretary of state reinforced the reasons views of her had been worsening prior to the July conventions. But before that convention, it was clear that Clinton was headed in the wrong direction and setting new records for her unpopularity. As I wrote back then, Gallup and CNN polls at the time showed her numbers worse than ever before  —   and even worse than Trump at the time.   Clinton’s image has been on a downward trajectory since her tenure as a highly popular secretary of state ended in 2013, and the decline continued through the primary campaign. That’s largely been obscured by her lead in the   polls  —   a lead that owes to Trump’s inferior image and likely Clinton’s advantages on her qualifications to serve as president. But Clinton is keeping this race competitive with her own personal problems. And right now, the voters who will determine the next president don’t like her much more than they like Trump.

The documents reveal a myriad of new details about the email   and show that investigators found multiple attempts by hackers to access Clinton’s system  —   a series of personal devices and servers that the Democratic presidential candidate told investigators she used as a matter of convenience while she was secretary of state.  The materials, which include a summary of the FBI’s entire investigation as well as Clinton’s   interview with agents in July, contain no major revelations. But they offer new details that Clinton’s political opponents will be able use in the months leading up to the November election. The summary shows that Clinton’s account to law enforcement was generally consistent with what she has said about her email situation publicly, but she repeatedly told agents she could not recall important details or specific emails she was questioned about.  [FBI’s attempt to show Clinton probe was nonpartisan keeps running into politics]  Clinton has been dogged by questions about her use of the private email server since the start of her presidential campaign and her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, has used the issue to argue she is untrustworthy.     FBI Director James Comey said on July 5 that Hillary Clinton should not be charged for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Here’s what he said, in three minutes. (Peter   Washington Post)   Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said, “While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case. ” Trump said in a statement: “Hillary Clinton’s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief. I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these documents, I really don’t understand how she was able to get away from prosecution. ”  FBI Director James B. Comey announced in July that his agency would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for her use of a private email server, though he said at the time she and her staffers were “extremely careless” in how they treated classified information. He said the decision was based largely on the fact that investigators did not find Clinton intended to mishandle classified material, though such material did traverse her private server. Ordinarily internal documents from FBI investigations are not made public. However, Comey has said the unusually high profile case warranted more robust public disclosures than is standard. The FBI found no evidence that anyone penetrated the email of the former secretary of state herself  —   although “hostile foreign actors successfully gained access to the personal   accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact and, in doing so, obtained   sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account,” the bureau wrote. Those include confidante Sidney Blumenthal, whose emails were hacked and publicly revealed by Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar.  The bureau wrote in its report that it was unable to track down all of Clinton’s electronic equipment because it had been destroyed or lost. One staffer told investigators he destroyed two mobile devices “by breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer. ” The FBI said it requested 13 devices from the law firm representing Clinton, and the firm said it could not produce any.  The FBI wrote that “investigative limitations, including the FBI’s inability to obtain all mobile devices and various computer components associated with Clinton’s personal   systems, prevented the FBI from conclusively determining whether the classified information transmitted and stored on Clinton’s personal server systems was compromised via cyber intrusion or other means. ”           The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we’ve learned from them.    Caption   Clinton has come under fire for using a private email address during her time as secretary of state.

214900,12 things I learned from the FBI report on Hillary Clinton’s private email server,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-09-02,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160903001748/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/02/12-things-i-learned-from-the-fbi-report-on-hillary-clintons-private-email-server/,"On Friday afternoon, the FBI released its   report on the investigation into the private email server Hillary Clinton used while serving as secretary of state. (The FBI also released an   document detailing its interview with Clinton in early July.) I went through the report, highlighting things I either found interesting or didn’t know. My notes  —   in the chronological order I made them while going through the report  —   are below. I don’t pretend that this is a comprehensive recording of all that we didn’t (or did) know about Clinton’s decision to set up a private email server and exclusively use it for her electronic correspondence while serving as the nation’s top diplomat. This is just one man’s observations.      FBI Director James Comey said on July 5 that Hillary Clinton should not be charged for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Here’s what he said, in three minutes. (Peter   Washington Post)   1. Clinton had 13 mobile devices during her four years at the State Department and five iPads.     She was unable to find any of the mobile devices to turn over to the FBI but did find three of the iPads. 2. Clinton never sought approval to conduct state business on her own private email server despite ”an obligation to do so.”       3. Former secretary of state Colin L. Powell advised Clinton to keep it secret that she was using a BlackBerry to conduct official business.       4. A note sent to all State Department employees on Clinton’s behalf warned them against the risks of using personal email addresses for official business.     Clinton told the FBI she did not remember sending that memorandum. 5. The State Department, regularly during Clinton’s tenure, sent out notes warning of the dangers of using mobile devices not up to agency security standards.     6. Clinton neither participated in conversations with her lawyers about how to determine which emails were professional and which were personal, nor did she provide them any guidance as to the locations of those emails.     7. Clinton told the FBI the decision to delete her personal emails was because she didn’t need them anymore, not because she was trying to avoid State Department, FBI or Freedom of Information Act requests.     8. Three weeks after the New York Times broke the story of the existence of Clinton’s email server, a number of Clinton’s emails were deleted  —   allegedly because of a missed request by Clinton’s State Department chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, in 2014.     9. The FBI found 17, 448   and personal emails that Clinton did not turn over to the State Department.     The FBI report offers no breakdown of how many of those 17, 448 were   and how many were personal. 10. Clinton told the FBI that she was unaware that the ”C” marking on emailed documents meant they were confidential.     11. Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton associate, sent the secretary of state 179 email memos during her time as the nation’s top diplomat.     12. Clinton was concerned that her email had been hacked."
214913,How Hillary Clinton helped create what she later called the ‘vast right-wing conspiracy’,Washington Post,Karen Tumulty,F,2016-09-02,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160903001748/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-was-right-about-the-vast-right-wing-conspiracy-heres-why-it-exists/2016/09/02/4a5e0fba-6879-11e6-99bf-f0cf3a6449a6_story.html,"The epic battles between the Clintons and their tormentors on the right have shaped American politics for nearly a quarter century.  But there was a moment early on when the toxic course of that history might have been changed, had it not been for Hillary Clinton’s impulses toward secrecy. It came one weekend near the end of Bill Clinton’s first year as president, and pitted the first lady against her husband’s advisers. “If a genie offered me the chance to turn back time and undo a single decision from my White House tenure, I’d head straight to the Oval Office dining room on Saturday morning, December 11, 1993,” ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, then a top aide to the president, wrote in his memoir “All Too Human. ” There was an urgent meeting that day to discuss a request by The Washington Post for documents relating to the Whitewater Development Corp. a failed Arkansas real estate investment the Clintons had made. Whitewater had been an issue in the 1992 presidential campaign. More recently, questions had arisen whether the land deal and the Clintons might be linked to the collapse of a savings and loan. Stephanopoulos and David Gergen, another senior adviser, were internal rivals at the time, who agreed on almost nothing. But both argued for full disclosure of the records. After a few days of rough coverage, they confidently predicted, the story would go away as the press corps discovered there was nothing sinister to the land deal and turned its attention elsewhere. The president would not budge  —   and both of them knew why. “Hillary Clinton is a woman of many strengths and virtues, but like all of us, she also has some blind spots,” Gergen said in a recent interview. “She does not see the world in the same way that others do, when it comes to transparency and accountability. ” She was not in the room, but the aides felt her presence. “You could usually tell when Clinton was making Hillary’s argument: Even if he was yelling, his voice had a flat quality, as if he were a high school debater speeding through a series of memorized facts,” Stephanopoulos wrote. “Gergen and I didn’t know what was in the Whitewater documents, but whatever it was, Hillary didn’t want it out  —   and she had a veto. ” The fallout from that decision to stonewall would be enormous. Pressure built for the appointment of a prosecutor, first Robert B. Fiske Jr. and then Kenneth W. Starr, who had been solicitor general under former president George Bush. Starr’s   investigation ultimately uncovered Bill Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which led to his impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, would have the dark distinction of becoming the only first lady in history ever called before a federal grand jury. In 1996, she testified for four hours, mostly to answer questions about subpoenaed   documents that had vanished and then suddenly reappeared in the White House living quarters. Gergen, Stephanopoulos and other top Clinton aides from that era  —   some of whom ended up with huge legal bills of their own  —   contend that none of this might have happened, had Hillary Clinton been more open in the first place. “I believe that decision against disclosure was the decisive turning point. If they had turned over the Whitewater documents to The Washington Post in December 1993, their    land deal would have soon disappeared as an issue and the story of the next seven years would have been entirely different,” Gergen wrote in his book about his time working for four presidents, from Nixon to Clinton.      Nannygate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Filegate: it’s tough to remember all the scandals that plagued   Bill and Hillary Clinton through the ’90s. For millennials     here’s what you missed. For everyone else, here’s a refresher. (Sarah Parnass, Adriana   Washington Post)    As he has watched the controversies that have beset her current presidential campaign, particularly the one over her private emails, Gergen has been struck by parallels to that pivotal moment in 1993. “She has built a protective shield around herself,” Gergen said. “Her first response is, when people come after me, I’m going to have my guard up and be suspicious of what their motives are. ”  [The inside story of how the Clintons built a $2 billion global empire]  Clinton drew the opposite lesson from those early Whitewater experiences  —   one that also shapes how she operates today. Her view was that she should have thrown up more resistance. In a conference call on Jan. 11, 1994, exactly one month after the meeting where Stephanopoulos and Gergen had been overruled, the president’s aides convinced the Clintons that they should request an independent investigation to quell the growing media furor. “We will never know if Congress would eventually have forced an independent counsel on us. And we will never know whether releasing an inevitably incomplete set of personal documents to The Washington Post would have averted a special prosecutor,” she wrote. “With the wisdom of hindsight, I wish I had fought harder. ” The real problem, Clinton argued, was that “we were being swept up in what legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin later described as the politicization of the criminal justice system and the criminalization of the political system. ”    Documents from the Starr investigation are unloaded at House Ford Office Building in 1998. (Susan   Washington Post)  Industry of scandal Since then, an entire industry has grown up around Clinton scandals, pseudo scandals and conspiracy theories. Countless millions have been raised and spent, both by their adversaries and their defenders.   congressional investigations have been launched, and lawsuits filed by conservative watchdog groups. The two sides wage constant war on the Internet, talk radio and cable news channels. A search of Amazon. com finds more than 40   books, with titles like “American Evita” and “Can She Be Stopped?” At the moment, three of the top 10 on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list are volumes bashing the Clintons.  So Hillary Clinton had it right when she made her famous declaration that a “vast   conspiracy” was out to get her and her husband. The opposition was and is passionate. It is well financed. It sees dark  —   sometimes preposterous  —   motives in nearly everything the Clintons do. By the time Barack Obama took office, what she had called a conspiracy had grown into a permanent institution. On an ideological and political level, it fought Obama’s expansive view of government through legislation, lawsuits and   movements like the tea party. In its darker corners, it spread sinister rumors about his patriotism, his religious beliefs and even his citizenship. But through it all, Hillary Clinton has remained a target for a particularly intense kind of vehemence. “Over time, some on the far right have made her into a   to instill fear and raise money,” said GOP strategist John Weaver. “Is she the devil incarnate? No. These critics can’t even explain why they hate her. It’s unhealthy for our politics. ” The Clintons’ aversion to transparency, as well as their tendency to skirt the rules and play close to the legal and ethical line, have made it easier for their enemies. Their defensiveness seems to have deepened, which worries some longtime friends and advisers. “I think she’s much more of that bent than he is. He sees the sunnier side, rather than the darker side,” said one former top aide who has known both Clintons for decades, and who agreed to talk about them if he would not be identified. “It’s grown worse over the years, and it’s now built up into, ‘They are out to get us.’ They’re not wrong, but did part of this come from their secretiveness, and unwillingness to make a clean breast of things?”  [What Hillary Clinton’s emails tell us about her management style]  Hillary Clinton cannot shake continuing questions over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation’s omnivorous appetite for contributions from donors who have government business. Polls consistently show strong majorities of voters do not consider her honest or trustworthy. That is because the perceptions have had a long time to settle. There are many   from the controversies of the 1990s to the ones dogging the Clintons today. When the existence of her private email account became public last year, Hillary Clinton initially claimed that she had set it up for convenience. It later became clear that she did it in part because she wanted to have the power to keep her records outside the realm of public discovery  —   just as she had hoped to do with the Whitewater documents. A State Department inspector general’s report noted that when the agency’s deputy chief of staff for operations suggested in 2010 that she set up a government account, the secretary responded: “Let’s get separate address or device but I don’t want any risk of the personal being accessible. ” She would delete more than 30, 000 emails from her personal server before turning over the remainder in response to a State Department demand. Similarly, the current questions of whether donors to the Clinton Foundation received special State Department access are an echo of the campaign finance scandals that erupted during Bill Clinton’s presidency. The evidence thus far does not confirm any “pay to play” operation. But it does indicate that some who wrote big foundation checks saw those gifts as a means of opening doors at Foggy Bottom. On Aug. 27, the conservative group Citizens United released emails obtained as part of a public records lawsuit. They showed that Clinton Foundation official Doug Band had pressed Clinton aide Huma Abedin to invite three donors, who had given millions to the foundation, to a 2011 State Department lunch with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Emails made public earlier showed, among other things, a sports executive using his foundation connections to press for a visa for a soccer player, and the crown prince of Bahrain going the same route to ask for a   meeting with the secretary of state after “normal channels” failed.  [Emails reveal how foundation donors got access to Clinton and her close aides at State Dept.]  “You can’t tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. Big donors get all the access, and that’s what this is about,” said David Bossie, who until this week was president of Citizens United. On Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump named Bossie his deputy campaign manager.  Bossie and other Clinton critics say there is precedent in arrangements made during the 1990s.   contributors to the Democratic National Committee were offered sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom and invited to coffees in the White House Map Room where regulators with oversight of their industries were present. Sometimes, the fundraising touched the tripwire between the unseemly and the illegal. Bundler Johnny Chung made at least 49 visits to the Clinton White House, including one where he dropped off a $50, 000 check at the first lady’s office. Two days after that, he was allowed to bring a group of Chinese businessmen to watch the president’s radio address, where they had their pictures taken with Bill Clinton. Chung later told federal investigators that $35, 000 of the $366, 000 he donated to the Democratic Party in 1996 came from the Chinese government. He pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy. On the other hand, many of the murky conspiracy theories and rumors that have swirled around the Clintons over the years have proven to be groundless  —   ridiculous, even. And yet, they persist. GOP nominee Donald Trump has trafficked in rumors that Clinton has serious health problems, although there is no real evidence, outside of doctored video and    photos that keep bouncing around the Internet. Clinton has called that speculation a “paranoid fever dream” on Trump’s part. Earlier this year, Trump dredged up old speculation that the Clintons may have had a hand in the 1993 death of their close friend, White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster. “He knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide,” Trump said. “I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder. ” There were five official probes into Foster’s death. None found evidence that it was anything but suicide. All told, seven separate independent counsel investigations of Clinton administration officials were conducted during his years in office. They had cost taxpayers nearly $80 million by the spring of 1999. Each time a new set of allegations arose, the prediction would come: This is the one that will do them in.    President Clinton and Hillary Clinton after the House vote to impeach the presdient in 1998. (GREG  )    as sport “There seems to be an undying belief that there’s a silver bullet here,” said David Brock, who runs a group of organizations allied with the Clintons, and who has been on both sides of the Clinton wars. When one does not pan out, he said, “another conspiracy theory is hatched. ” In the early 1990s, Brock was an investigative reporter for conservative publications. A story he wrote for the American Spectator claimed that Arkansas state troopers had arranged for trysts for Bill Clinton while he was governor there. One of the women mentioned, Paula Jones, subsequently filed a sexual harassment suit against Clinton that became part of Starr’s investigation and ultimately triggered the perjury charge against him. Controversies of varying degrees of seriousness tumbled by during Clinton’s eight years in office: Troopergate, Filegate, Travelgate, Chinagate, Pardongate. Even the more trivial ones left an aroma of malfeasance long after details had become a blur. All of it drew upon a cynicism and suspicion of government officials that harked back to the first “gate”  —   Watergate. Hillary Clinton herself had come to Washington fresh out of law school to work for the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment inquiry of Richard M. Nixon. Watergate produced new levers against corruption. After Nixon’s resignation, the Freedom of Information Act was strengthened. Congress also passed the Ethics in Government Act, which called for more financial disclosure from government officials and set up procedures for independent investigations of those who were accused of wrongdoing. Meanwhile, the media had become more skeptical of government and less willing to take officials at their word. When Bill and Hillary Clinton arrived in the White House,   had already become part of Washington’s political culture. The Reagan administration’s   scandal was still a fresh memory. The Supreme Court nominations of Robert H. Bork in 1987 and Clarence Thomas in 1991 had turned into epic partisan battles. In 1989, former senator John Tower ( .) failed a confirmation vote as defense secretary because he had a reputation as a heavy drinker, marking the first time in 30 years that a president had been denied a Cabinet pick. Later that year, a tenacious backbench congressman named Newt Gingrich ( .) forced the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright ( .) over ethics charges. One of the most dogged groups to pursue the Clintons has been Judicial Watch, a conservative organization founded in 1994. Its current efforts include 18 active lawsuits to force disclosure of public records from Hillary Clinton’s State Department tenure. “The permanent infrastructure around government corruption began with Watergate. Up until Judicial Watch, [watchdog groups] were all creatures of the left,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The right is increasingly using the same tools to great effect. ” Among Judicial Watch’s early funders was the late Richard Mellon Scaife, reclusive heir to a banking fortune, who also bankrolled the conservative American Spectator magazine and its “Arkansas project” to examine the Clintons’ past. Why were the Clintons such an inviting target, and why have they remained one all these years? As with everything else, the two sides have diametrically different views. Trump has labeled Clinton “crooked Hillary” and says she may be “the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. ” The couple had a reputation for shading the truth that began even before they reached the White House. Bill Clinton was known as “Slick Willie” back in Arkansas, and the nickname seemed to fit as he glided through political eruptions over his actions. He had smoked marijuana at Oxford University, he admitted, but insisted he had not inhaled. He had avoided the Vietnam draft around that time by signing up for ROTC, then reneged on the promise when a high lottery number assured he would not be selected. He steadfastly denied a 1992 tabloid report that he had had a   affair with an Arkansas state government worker and cabaret singer named Gennifer Flowers  —   only to acknowledge in a deposition six years later that he had had a sexual relationship with her. And while he did not admit to harassing Jones, another Arkansas state employee, he ended up paying $850, 000 to settle a lawsuit that originally asked for $700, 000. Hillary Clinton also became known for telling implausible stories when her back was against the wall. When it came out in 1994 that she had turned a $1, 000 investment in cattle futures into nearly $100, 000 in a matter of months in the 1970s, the White House initially claimed the novice trader had based her decisions on information she found in the Wall Street Journal. The Clintons were also the first baby boomers to reach the White House, bringing with them the unresolved debates that had raged between the left and the right since the 1960s. “They represented a huge cultural shift, not only generationally, but Hillary as the first lady, with her own professional identity and political portfolio. All of that inspired a lot of fear among opponents of that change,” Brock said. A prominent Clinton ally and former aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, added: “It’s Vietnam, pot, sex  —   and God knows, Clinton represented all of that. ” Some argue that what really bothered the right was the fact that Bill Clinton was such a skillful politician. He had   them on issues they regarded as their own  —   among them, crime, trade and welfare reform. “I think the Republicans figured early on they couldn’t take him down politically. He was too adept,” so they found other ways, said the Clinton ally. Whether that was the calculation or not, his opponents were constantly attacking. They went far beyond raising questions of government impropriety.   talk radio and the new medium of the Internet, which brought in fresh players like the Drudge Report, spread fantastic theories tying the Clintons to everything from   to murder. “By 1996, it was in full force. Although we had the White House, Hillary was always very critical of the lack of effectiveness in our response,” the former presidential aide said. At one point, the Clinton team assembled a   internal report which alleged a “communication stream of conspiracy commerce. ” They came up with a byzantine theory of how it all worked: Unverified stories would originate at   organizations, find their way onto the Internet, be picked up by conservative publications or London tabloids, make their way back into the U. S. media, then trigger congressional inquiries  —   at which point, they would become legitimate fodder for mainstream news organizations. Opponents dismissed this view as paranoia. C. Boyden Gray, who had been George H. W. Bush’s White House counsel, called it “kind of goofy,” but he conceded that every president feels embattled at some point. “I think that happens to many White Houses,” Gray told The Washington Post. “But I don’t think any of us would have put that much pen to paper. ”    Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr talks to the media outside his offices in Little Rock on Feb. 18, 1997. (Jeff  )  Recruiting the enemy David Brock, whose article about the Arkansas state troopers had sparked the Paula Jones lawsuit, disavowed the   forces in a 1997 Esquire article headlined, “Confessions of a   Hit Man. ” He followed that up in 2002 with a book, “Blinded by the Right. ” “What interested Democrats about the book was not the personal confessions part of it, but the part that described the largely institutional efforts by the right,” he said. Early the next year, Brock got a   call from Bill Clinton, whom he had never met. The former president asked Brock what he planned to do next, and Brock described an idea for a liberal organization to push back against news coverage, much as Accuracy in Media had been doing from the right since 1969. Clinton suggested that Brock create a business plan, which Brock did and sent to him. Bill Clinton shared it with Hillary, who by then was a New York senator. She invited Brock to present it at meetings with her major donors in the fall of 2003, both in Washington and at her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. Their checkbooks opened. His group, Media Matters, launched in 2004. Brock now runs four other organizations that he says were “built to counter the   machine. ” They are Correct the Record, which describes itself as “a strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks;” American Bridge, which focuses on opposition research; the Franklin Forum, which provides media training; and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group he took over in 2014. He also sits on the board of the   super PAC Priorities USA Action. Groups on the other side “obviously still have more resources. However, if you look at the last 10 years or so, we’ve been better at the use of new media, social media, than some of the legacy   institutions,” Brock contended. “I feel like the playing field has gotten much more level from the time I started doing this until now. ” He also noted that new, explicitly liberal media players have emerged  —   among them, the Huffington Post and Talking Points Memo. All of which suggests that, should there be another Clinton presidency, the battles of the last one will continue and escalate. What Bill Clinton once described as the “politics of personal destruction” are now a permanent fixture of the U. S. political system, likely to endure long after anyone can remember what started it all.  Lois Romano contributed to this report."
214996,Hillary Clinton greets her traveling press corps aboard her new plane,Washington Post,John Wagner,M,2016-09-05,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160906001105/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/05/hillary-clinton-greets-her-traveling-press-corps-aboard-her-new-plane/,"IN THE AIR EN ROUTE TO CLEVELAND  —   Hillary Clinton, who has had a standoffish relationship with the traveling press corps that follows her, made a point Monday of venturing to the back of her new campaign plane to offer greetings shortly before its maiden voyage  —   and promised a “more formal” conversation later. “Hey, guys, welcome to our big plane,” Clinton told about three dozen members of the news media occupying the plane’s final seven rows. “It’s so exciting. ” “I am so happy to have all of you with me,” she said in response to a question about sharing a plane with the press corps. “ I have just been waiting for this moment. ” Before Monday, Clinton and the press corps had been traveling the country on separate charter planes, with limited interaction between the Democratic presidential nominee and those who cover her on a daily basis. The plane is a Boeing 737 that the Clinton campaign noted was manufactured in the United States. The color scheme is described as scion blue and white, and it is prominently adorned with Clinton’s “Stronger Together” slogan and the campaign’s “H” logo. Clinton’s motorcade arrived Monday at the airport in Westchester County, N. Y. not far from her Chappaqua home, shortly after 10 a. m. The plane was soon en route to Cleveland, the first of two cities the candidate plans to visit on Labor Day. Her ticket has a full day of events to commemorate the holiday. Clinton’s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, is also on the trail, as are their spouses, Vice President Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the   for the Democratic nomination.      After months of not engaging with the traveling press, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke to and answered questions from members of the media at the back of her new campaign plane Sept. 5. (Video: The Washington  : Melina   Washington Post)   Speaking to the media, Clinton said Labor Day marked the start of “the mad dash” to the November election, in which she faces off against Republican Donald Trump. It has been several months since Clinton last held a   news conference, a dynamic that has been in the news lately and has served as a talking point for Republican critics. Trump’s campaign made note of Clinton’s new plane in an email to reporters, offering several suggested questions for reporters to ask her later Monday about her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. “New plane, more questions,” read the subject header. Asked whether she had a Labor Day message, Clinton offered this: “If you want more happy Labor Days, you know who to vote for. ”"
215076,Hillary Clinton finally gave a news conference. What took so long?,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-09-08,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160909000027/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/08/hillary-clintons-finally-gave-a-press-conference-what-took-so-long/,"On Thursday morning, Sept. 8, Hillary Clinton held a good   news conference. A podium in front of her campaign plane. Reporters asking her questions on camera. Give and take. The whole shebang. It was the first time she had done so since early December  —   a span of more than 270 days that led to an ongoing negative storyline about Clinton’s lack of transparency and her standoffish relationship with the media. (There is some debate about whether Clinton broke her    streak over the weekend on her plane. I tend to see the event today as the first traditional news conference held by her since December.) And, nothing happened. The world didn’t stop spinning. Toilets still flushed the same way. Pokémon Go was still  . All of which led to the question: What the heck took so long? I’ve written before that Clinton has struggled with news conferences  —   most notably one she held at the United Nations after the revelations about her decision to use a private email server and use it exclusively during her time as secretary of state.    But the reasons for those struggles seemed primarily rooted in the fact that she held news conferences only in reaction to negative news events  —   and even then very infrequently. Because of that approach, Clinton was, by definition, on the defensive and facing a heavily pressurized situation from the get go. It’s like telling people you are going to reveal the future of journalism on Dec. 18, 2019.  By the time you get to that day, people will have been waiting a very long time for your big reveal. Their expectation is that it is going to be amazing. And if it isn’t amazing, they are going to pillory you. Contrast that with trying daily, weekly or even monthly to innovate in journalism. The bar is way lower for success. As are the expectations. That’s why it never made sense for Clinton to wait so long to do the (relatively) simple task of taking questions on camera from journalists. Take Clinton’s event today. She used the first three or four minutes to draw the media’s attention to Donald Trump’s uneven  —   to be generous  —   performance at NBC’s forum on national secrity on Wednesday night. She then took  a handful of questions. The first  —   on why she wasn’t further ahead of Trump  —   was somewhat adversarial. But the rest of the questions were relatively generic  —  about the Republican National Committee’s comments about Clinton and Gary Johnson’s ignorance about where Aleppo is. There were no questions about her emails  —   much to the consternation of Republicans. The broader point is this: The news conference wasn’t terribly painful for Clinton. It probably helps her continue to drive a negative news cycle for Trump, focused on his odd comments on Russian President Vladimir Putin and military generals. And, perhaps most importantly, it begins to unravel the common perception among the public that Clinton is neither honest nor trustworthy. Politics is sometimes simpler than we all make it out to be. Maybe Clinton figured that out this morning."
215077,2 big problems with Hillary Clinton’s no-ground-troops pledge,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-09-08,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160909000027/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/08/the-two-biggest-problems-with-hillary-clintons-pledge-to-never-send-ground-troops-into-iraq-and-syria/,"Iraq has long been an uncomfortable subject for Hillary Clinton. Her vote to authorize the war alienated progressives and arguably cost her the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. And now it’s even being used against her by Donald Trump (who falsely claims to have opposed the war). So Clinton took a bold step Wednesday night when it comes to Iraq and neighboring Syria, where the battle against the Islamic State has been raging for 13 years. ”They are not going to get ground troops,” she said at a   NBC forum. ”We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again. And we’re not putting ground troops into Syria. We’re going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops.” She said it four times. Clearly, this was a message she intended to deliver. She elaborated in a news conference Thursday morning.   Clinton on ground troops: ”There is no, in my opinion, path forward to ground troops that would be in our interest”  —   NPR Politics (@nprpolitics) September 8, 2016   The first big problem with this premise is the fact that there are already arguably ground troops in Iraq and Syria. The second is that in recent months, generals have asked for even more. In other words: The potential need for a   effort is already evident, but Clinton is completely foreclosing that option in a way that doesn’t allow for changing circumstances. At the core of Clinton’s promise is the definition of ”ground troops.” The Obama administration itself has notably changed its own verbiage when referring to troops serving in Iraq and Syria. Obama said repeatedly in 2013 that there would be no ”boots on the ground” in Syria. ”I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria,” he said in a televised address in September 2013. By 2014, though, the administration slightly altered its promise, pledging that there would be no combat troops on the ground. And then the administration in 2015 announced a small number of special forces would indeed be put on the ground there. It’s also worth noting here that there are technically thousands of U. S. troops already on the ground in Iraq. The administration stresses that these troops are training the Iraqis and serving in advisory capacities  —   not combat troops  —   but they are on the ground. So it’s somewhat odd that Clinton is drawing the line at ground troops and not combat troops, as the administration does. Even the administration’s pledge has been tested at times; it’s not hard to see Clinton’s also coming under scrutiny in the years ahead. Circling back to that second reason Clinton might regret her promise Wednesday night, it’s worth noting that    generally try to avoid taking options off the table. And you needn’t look far in the rear view to see why. Whether or not you think Obama has technically made good on his promise to not put ground troops in Syria, he has clearly failed to keep his promises to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and to bring all American troops home from Afghanistan by the end of his presidency. The Fix’s Amber Phillips said it well last year: There are a variety of reasons things haven’t gone Obama’s way  —   some arguably his making, others he had no control over. Congress and other countries blocked many transfers of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay (though critics of closing Guantanamo would say this was predictable); whether the withdrawal from Iraq helped the Islamic State is much debated; and Iraq and Afghanistan’s political turmoil hasn’t made it easy for the president to exit those two countries. But the bottom line is that Obama’s campaign promises, which sounded feasible enough at the time to those who agreed with his worldview and rewarded him for it, relied on too much he couldn’t control. He stepped into office in 2009 with a grand strategy  —   in his words, ”to lead this country in a new direction”  —   but much has conspired to keep America’s Middle East policy focused on Iraq and Afghanistan. In sum: The only expectation is the unexpected  —   especially when it comes to the Middle East and the Islamic State. Taking options off the table, as Obama has done and now Clinton is doing, is fraught both militarily and politically. Clinton’s promise appeared to make even a top military adviser of hers, retired U. S. Air Force Brig. Gen. John Douglass, squirm Thursday morning. Pressed on her pledge on NBC’s ”Today,” Douglass tried to make the case that she hadn’t actually ”meant” to take any options off the table. ”You can look at that one way or another, and I don’t think she meant to take an option off the table,” he said. ”I think she meant to say that her policy is that she is not going to go in at the scale that [George W.] Bush and others have done there in Iraq.” But that’s not what Clinton said. Her language clearly took the option of ground troops  —   however you define that  —   off the table in both Iraq and Syria. There is simply no other way to read her comments. She said the United States would ”never again” put ground troops in Iraq. She didn’t allow for changing circumstances. She sought to allay concerns about her own hawkishness by making a blanket promise about what she wouldn’t do as commander in chief. The wisdom of those words could indeed be tested in the years to come."
215143,Hillary Clinton’s health just became a real issue in the presidential campaign,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-09-11,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160912001503/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/11/hillary-clintons-health-just-became-a-real-issue-in-the-presidential-campaign/,"Hillary Clinton falling ill Sunday morning at a memorial service on the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks will catapult questions about her health from the ranks of conservative conspiracy theory to perhaps the central debate in the presidential race over the coming days. ”Secretary Clinton attended the September 11th Commemoration Ceremony for just an hour and thirty minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen,” spokesman Nick Merrill said. ”During the ceremony, she felt overheated, so departed to go to her daughter’s apartment and is feeling much better.” What that statement leaves out is that a) it came 90 minutes after Clinton left the ceremony b) reporters  —   or even a reporter  —   were not allowed to follow her and c) the temperature in New York City at the time of Clinton’s overheating was in the low 80s. (A heat wave over the eastern United States broke last   morning.) She later left her daughter’s apartment, saying she was ”feeling great” and waving at the crowd, per the Associated Press. Whether Clinton likes it or not, her ”overheating” episode comes at a very bad time for her campaign. Thanks to the likes of Rudy Giuliani and a small but vocal element of the Republican base, talk of her health had been bubbling over the past week  —   triggered by a coughing episode she experienced during a Labor Day rally. That talk was largely confined to Republicans convinced that Clinton has long been hiding some sort of serious illness. I wrote dismissively of that conspiracy theory in this space last week, noting that Clinton had been given an entirely clean bill of health by her doctors after an episode in which she fainted, suffered a concussion and then was found to have a blood clot in late 2012 and early 2013. Coughing, I wrote, is simply not evidence enough of any sort of major illness that Clinton is assumed to be hiding. Neither, of course, is feeling ”overheated.” But those two things happening within six days of each other to a candidate who is 68 years old makes talk of Clinton’s health no longer just the stuff of conspiracy theorists. Whereas Clinton and her campaign could laugh off questions about her health before today, the ”overheating” episode makes it almost impossible for them to do so. Not only has it come at a time when there was growing chatter  —   with very little evidence  —   that her health was a problem but it also happened at a   memorial event  —   an incredibly   moment with lots and lots of cameras and reporters around. Her campaign may well try to dismiss this story as nothing more than an isolated incident, meaning nothing. (Democrats were already pushing the story of George W. Bush fainting in 2002 after choking on a pretzel, via Twitter.) But the issue is that Clinton kept reporters totally in the dark for 90 minutes after her abrupt departure from the   memorial service for a   matter. No reporter was allowed to follow her. (Clinton has resisted a protective pool for coverage because Donald Trump refuses to participate in one.) This is, yet again, the Clinton campaign asking everyone to just trust it. She got overheated! But she’s fine now!      Presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are expected to put their campaigns on pause to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York. (AP; Photo: Getty Images)   Clinton may well be totally fine  —   and I certainly hope she is. But we are 58 days away from choosing the person who will lead the country for the next four years, and she is one of the two candidates with a real chance of winning. Taking the Clinton team’s word for it on her health  —   in light of the episode on Sunday morning  —   is no  longer enough. Reasonable people can  —   and will  —    have real questions about her health. I wrote this on Tuesday morning: The simple fact is that there is zero evidence that anything is seriously wrong with Clinton. If suffering an occasional coughing fit is evidence of a major health problem, then 75 percent of the country must have that mystery illness. And I am one of them. Well, that is no longer operative. Context matters. A coughing episode is almost always just a coughing episode. But when coupled with Clinton’s ”overheating” on Sunday morning  —   with temperatures something short of sweltering  —   Clinton and her team simply need to say something about what happened (and why the press was in the dark for so long.) And as the New York Times’s Adam Nagourney tweeted on Sunday morning, now might be a good time for Clinton to release a fuller record of her medical history.

215246,Hillary Clinton regrets her Iraq vote. But opting for intervention was a pattern.,Washington Post,Michael Kranish,M,2016-09-15,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160916002319/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-regrets-her-iraq-vote-but-opting-for-intervention-was-a-pattern/2016/09/15/760c23d0-6645-11e6-96c0-37533479f3f5_story.html,"It was hours before Sen. Hillary Clinton would vote in 2002 on whether to give President George W. Bush the authority to go to war with Iraq. She had been advised by her husband and many close associates to vote “yes. ” Now, at the last minute, she met with a group of church leaders, joining hands in silent prayer, insisting that she remained undecided. “What I saw was her asking a lot of probing questions, a lot of concern about would this be effective,” said Andrew Shapiro, Clinton’s foreign policy adviser at the time, referring to the days leading up to her decision. In the end, however, the Democrat crossed party lines and voted for the authorization to use military force. It would take her years to acknowledge that the decision was misguided, eventually calling it “my mistake. ” But it was little surprise to many who watched her evolution as a hawk over her years as a first lady and then as a senator. For years, Clinton has blamed Bush for misleading her into voting for the resolution. But an examination by The Washington Post found that her decision was based as much on advice from her husband’s advisers as from Bush administration officials. There were also significant gaps in her   most notably her apparent failure to read a classified analysis that other senators cited in voting against the resolution.  [How Hillary Clinton made the tough call to back the 2011 bombing of Libya]  The path to Clinton’s decision was paved by her evolving sense of presidential power, forged during years in which she played a bigger role than widely realized in pushing her husband to intervene militarily in the Balkans, Iraq and Kosovo. She continued that path when she advocated intervention in Libya as secretary of state.    First lady Hillary Clinton listens as President Bill Clinton speaks to the media about a U. S. missile strike against Iraq before attending church in Washington on June 27, 1993. The president pronounced the strike a success but said he regretted that civilians were killed. (Greg   Press)  Clinton’s actions provide a window into how she might conduct herself as president, balancing countless calls for action to prevent global crises against risking the lives of American troops. Fourteen years later, Clinton’s decision is a heated issue in her presidential campaign against Republican Donald Trump, who said at a Sept. 7 forum that her vote and other hawkish actions show that “she has a happy trigger. ” Clinton responded that force is her last resort, even as she acknowledged that she regrets the Iraq decision. (Trump has repeatedly said he opposed the resolution, but   have determined that he favored it at the time Clinton voted.) Once branded dovish because of her antipathy to the Vietnam War, Clinton had watched from her   White House seat what happened when presidential power was left unused as masses died in Rwanda and initially in the Balkans. As she saw the benefits of intervention, her views of executive power expanded. She argued that a president should have latitude to launch military missions because, as she starkly put it in justifying her 2002 vote, “sometimes a president has to do what he thinks is right no matter what anyone else says. ” She embraced an approach to military force that in many cases argued for using it  —   rather than regretting not doing so. Clinton declined requests to be interviewed for this article. Her campaign also would not say whether she read the classified report about Iraq’s purported weapons of mass destruction, or to provide names of opponents with whom she consulted, other than citing the meeting with church members. Instead, Jesse Lehrich, her foreign policy spokesman, noted in a statement that Clinton considered the Iraq vote “one of the hardest decisions of her life  —   one she anguished over exhaustively and, of course, one she came to regret in the end. ” Stopping the bloodshed A soft rain fell on April 22, 1993, as the first lady attended the opening of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The Clintons had just settled into the White House, and their new national security team was already facing a humanitarian disaster in the Balkans, scene of one of the bloodiest European conflicts since World War II.    President Bill Clinton, center, along with Bud Meyerhoff, left, chairman of the U. S. Holocaust Council, and Elie Wiesel, founding chairman of the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Council, prepare to light an eternal flame during the dedication ceremony for the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington on April 22, 1993. (J. Scott   Press)  Guest speaker Elie Wiesel, a Nobel   Holocaust survivor, urged President Clinton to try to stop the mass killings that came to be known as ethnic cleansing. “We must do something to stop the bloodshed,” he said. Hillary Clinton later said the speech was one of several by Wiesel that deeply influenced her thinking about the use of American force. She watched as her husband delayed action in the Balkans, and then, a year later as he did not intervene in response to reports of a genocide in Rwanda that killed an estimated 800, 000. She was with her husband when Wiesel later admonished him for Rwanda, telling the president, “We could have prevented that massacre. ”    President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton listen to a Rwandan woman speak about surviving the massacre there during the 7th Millennium Evening at the White House on April 12, 1999. The Clintons and Elie Wiesel led the discussion. (Tim     via Getty Images)  In 1995, as the White House sought to recover from the domestic failure of Hillary Clinton’s   plan and a Republican takeover of Congress, the president faced new pressure to act in the Balkans after 8, 000 people were killed in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. Some of the president’s aides feared that he had an aversion to intervention, given the downing of two Black Hawk helicopters and the loss of 18 troops in Somalia in October 1993. They came to view the first lady as a conduit who would push her husband to take military force. Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke  —   long an advocate of U. S. action in the Balkans  —   turned to the first lady for help persuading the president. “He warned her that Bosnia was ‘a cancer on the presidency,’ ” said Derek Chollet, a former speechwriter for Holbrooke, who died in 2010. Hillary Clinton later said she became convinced that “selective airstrikes are the only way to stop the genocide. ” After the president authorized the strikes, she credited intervention for a peace accord, which she observed as an emissary to Bosnia. Extraordinary threat In early 1998, Hillary Clinton faced the press corps in the White House’s Map Room. Reporters had been focused on allegations that her husband had had an affair with a White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky. Hillary Clinton chose this moment, for the first time in such a public setting, to take on Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi leader was “without conscience,” having used weapons of mass destruction on “his own people,” she told reporters, referring to an attack on Kurds a decade earlier. “We are facing an extraordinary threat from this man. Something will have to be done. ” Iraq had been a festering issue for President Clinton. In the wake of reports that Hussein was behind an unsuccessful effort to assassinate former president George H. W. Bush, the president in July 1993 ordered the launch of 23 cruise missiles on Baghdad. Tensions escalated further when a U. N. report blamed economic sanctions for the deaths of 500, 000 Iraqi children, but U. S. officials shifted the blame to Hussein. Amid reports that weapons inspectors were being blocked from key sites, a group of neoconservatives who would later play top roles in the Bush administration pushed for regime change. Congress in October 1998 passed the Iraq Liberation Act, which called for Hussein’s removal. Hillary Clinton would repeatedly cite the legislation as part of the rationale for her Iraq War vote four years later. After signing the legislation, President Clinton ordered bombers to Iraq in   1998. But he turned the planes around in midflight after Hussein suddenly promised cooperation. On Dec. 15, 1998, the Clintons flew from Israel back to Washington to face a likely impeachment vote related to the Lewinsky scandal. National security adviser Sandy Berger and Bruce Riedel, one of his deputies, accompanied them. While the president rested, Hillary Clinton conferred with his aides about rescheduling the attack on Iraq. “The president was in his bedroom suite, sleeping, and Mrs. Clinton was sitting with Sandy Berger and myself,” Riedel, then the National Security Council’s senior director for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, said in an interview. “She was listening quite avidly and taking it all in, and at one point or another we started saying, “What if we get another   Saddam dodge?’ As I recall it, she said, “ ‘You can’t let him do that again; you need to pull the trigger.’ ” Riedel often discussed foreign affairs with the first lady. “The most   person in the Clinton administration was the president,” he said. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, “was among those who were encouraging the president not to let Saddam Hussein off the hook this time. . . . She was not in the chain of command, but she was among his most important advisers. A great deal of the memos Sandy sent to the president, she got a copy as well. ” Berger, who died in 2015, said in an oral history for the University of Virginia’s Miller Center that he, too, never doubted Hillary Clinton’s influence. “I often thought in the morning I heard some echoes of Hillary in something he said,” Berger said, referring to the president. Deep influence Operation Desert Fox was designed as a   attack on 100 sites, mostly aimed at Hussein’s power structure. Weapons inspectors heeded U. S. warnings to evacuate. “I have no doubt today that, left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will use these terrible weapons again,” President Clinton told the nation as the attack was launched, referring to suspected weapons of mass destruction. After waiting for the bombing to end, the House impeached the president, but he survived because the Senate did not convict him, and Hussein survived as the bombing stopped. A few months later, as Hillary Clinton prepared to run for the Senate from New York, she and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, traveled to Africa. One night, in a phone call with her husband, the couple discussed a proposal to back bombing in Kosovo, which many Republicans opposed. President Clinton was hesitant, but his wife was certain. “I urged him to bomb; I supported him,” Hillary Clinton told Talk magazine at the time. “You cannot let this go on at the end of a century that has seen the major holocaust of our time. What do we have NATO for if not to defend our way of life?” Shortly after returning from Africa, the first lady hosted Wiesel at a White House event, “The Perils of Indifference,” which focused on the lessons of the Holocaust. Clinton made clear that the lesson for her was to be more willing to use force. “Many of us in this room have personal experiences that are much more recent and fresh, about what it means to face that evil and that indifference today,” she said, citing her travel to trouble spots. Clinton’s role in her husband’s foreign policy continued. In 2000, she attended a White House session with the president and his national security aides to discuss Hussein’s latest moves. Kenneth Pollack, the NSC director for Persian Gulf affairs at the time, said in an interview: “Clearly her husband felt he wanted her there. She would be there, she would give him advice, sometimes with us in the room. She asked really smart questions. ” Hillary Clinton hailed the intervention in Iraq as a success. But U. N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who had tried to forestall bombing, later wrote that “Desert Fox ushered in a   period without inspections and without a dialogue with Iraq. ” Seeking advice As Hillary Clinton prepared to be sworn in as a senator in 2001, her husband’s administration handed over Iraq policy to   George W. Bush. Bush and his aides suspected that Hussein had used the absence of inspections to escalate a weapons of mass destruction program, and they studied the possibility of an invasion.  The Bush administration’s planning on Iraq escalated in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Hillary Clinton was at the U. S. Capitol when she learned about the mass casualties at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The senator soon urged Bush to provide $20 billion to rebuild New York. The president agreed, and a gratified Clinton said, “I’ll stand behind Bush for a long time to come. ” That pledge was tested a year later as the president urged Congress to grant him the authority to attack Iraq. Despite nearly universal support for intervening in Afghanistan, where Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden was sheltered, the Iraq resolution encountered opposition from various leading Democrats, who said that Hussein had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks and that it would give Bush too much latitude. As Hillary Clinton considered whether to support the resolution, her husband publicly endorsed regime change, as he had in 1998. Many of Hillary Clinton’s advisers had been top officials in her husband’s administration. Pollack, her husband’s former aide, had just published a book, “The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq. ” Clinton asked him to visit her.    Sen. Hillary Clinton, a member of the Armed Services Committee, questions Gen. John P. Abizaid, back to camera, on Capitol Hill during a hearing about Iraq on Nov. 15, 2006. (Pablo Martinez   Press)  After Pollack stressed Hussein’s dangers, Clinton asked him about the Iraqi leader’s intentions. “I just remember being forced to say to her, ‘I’m sorry, Senator, I wish I knew the answer to that. No one other than Saddam Hussein knows the answer,’ ” Pollack recalled. Riedel, the former NSC aide who had often consulted with Clinton, said he believed at the time that war with Iraq was “insane. ” He was convinced that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. But Riedel said he did not talk directly to Clinton, instead conveying his views to Berger, who was advising the senator and thought that Hussein had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. In her public comments, Clinton strongly suggested support for Bush. “I agreed then with President Clinton,” Hillary Clinton said on Sept. 15 on “Meet the Press,” referring to her husband’s effort to oust Hussein. “I agree with President Bush’s emphasis on this issue. ” “I can’t imagine that we won’t” give Bush the authority, she said. Sorting facts Bush called Clinton to the White House on Oct. 8, 2002, three days before the vote. His public arguments included a stream of   claims, including that Hussein had weapons “capable of killing millions. ” After Clinton left the White House, she took a call from national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. Clinton later cited this conversation as evidence that the Bush administration “misled” her. As she told it in a 2006 interview with the Atlantic, “Condi Rice called me and asked if I had any questions. I said, ‘Look, I have one question: If the president has this authority, will he go to the United Nations and use it to get inspectors to go back into Iraq and figure out what this guy has?’ ” “Yes, that’s what it’s for,” Rice responded, according to Clinton. Rice declined to comment, but her spokeswoman, Georgia Godfrey, said via email that Rice never would have suggested that “the Authorization would be limited to getting inspectors in. ” Clinton, like every other senator, was invited to read classified intelligence reports in a secure room on Capitol Hill. The report had caveats  —   absent from an unclassified version  —   that led some senators to doubt the administration’s case. Sen. Bob Graham ( .) who chaired the Intelligence Committee, pleaded with colleagues to read the document before voting. Clinton has left the clear impression that she did not read the full report. She said in a 2008 interview on “Meet the Press” that she was briefed by its authors and that “not very many people read the whole thing. ” When The Post asked a campaign spokesman to say definitively whether she read it, he pointed to Clinton’s 2008 statement. Graham, who voted no, said in an interview that he remains frustrated that so many senators did not read the report. “I’m not sure if Senator Clinton read that or not; if she did, it apparently wasn’t sufficiently persuasive,” he said. Some Clinton aides said they were uncertain until the end how she would vote. But her inclination to support Bush was so well known that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( .) who was trying to rally opposition, made no effort to change her mind, a former Kennedy aide said. Clinton has cited as reasons for her support her gratitude for Bush’s financial support for New York, her expectation that the vote would reopen inspections, and her underlying belief in strong presidential authority. She has also cited the advocacy of Clinton administration officials and the legacy of the Iraq Liberation Act. She has rejected suggestions that reading the full National Intelligence Estimate would have made a difference, noting that some who read it voted for the resolution. On Oct. 10, 2002, Clinton’s Senate speech harked back to her husband’s 1998 attack on Iraq, even as she stressed her hope for a diplomatic solution. “Left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons,” she said. The Senate approved the measure 77 to 23, with Democrats favoring it 29 to 21. The two other opponents were an independent and a Republican. The House also voted in favor. The drumbeat for war mounted. The Bush administration said Hussein still refused to allow adequate inspections, and an invasion threat had not resolved the issue. Bush launched the attack in March 2003, sending more than 100, 000 U. S. troops to Iraq.    Lt. Col. Brian Mennes gives Sens. Hillary Clinton ( . Y.) and Jack Reed ( . I.) a tour of the base of the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Airborne Division, in Baghdad on Nov. 28, 2003. (Dusan   Press)  A year after the vote, Clinton defended it on CNN, citing “grave threats to the United States. ” But the basis of her decision was soon undermined. In October 2004, a U. N. team led by Charles Duelfer reported that weapons of mass destruction “stocks do not exist. ” Clinton contacted Pollack, a voice that had urged her to vote for war. “So, Ken, what happened to the weapons of mass destruction?” she asked, as he recalled it. “I’m as mystified as you are, Senator,” Pollack said he responded. In 2008, as Clinton sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the first time, her pollster found that most voters would react negatively if she acknowledged that her vote was a mistake. She refrained from using the word, even as her primary rival, Barack Obama, attacked her vote. She now characterizes her vote as a painful but valuable lesson. “It is imperative that we learn from the mistakes,” she said earlier this month. “We must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again. I think I’m in the best possible position to be able to understand that and prevent it. ”  Magda   and Alice Crites contributed to this report."

And it’s not even an argument that’s unique to him. It’s an extension of a favored argument used by the National Rifle Association    ”The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun”    and it’s one the gun rights crowd has used with gusto against Democrats who support gun control, including President Obama. There was even a White House petition a few years back calling on the White House to disarm security guards for Obama, Vice President Biden and their families, given the White House’s stance on guns. So Trump was on   ground here. The difference Friday night, though, is that he took a comment that was worn and not all that interesting and spun it forward with just a few extra words, giving it new life by painting a more violent picture. Let’s recap what he has said about this, first from Friday night (emphasis ours): She goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm. Right? Right? I think they should disarm immediately. What do you think? Yes? Yes. Yeah. Take their guns away. She doesn’t want guns. . .. Let’s see what happens to her. Take their guns away, okay? It would be very dangerous. Here’s what he said all the way back in January:   Hillary said that guns don’t keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2016   Here’s what he said in May:   Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 21, 2016   He told the NRA a couple days prior: “Heartless hypocrites like the Clintons . .. want to get rid of guns, and yet they have bodyguards that have guns,” Trump said, calling on the Clintons’ bodyguards to “immediately disarm. ” “And let’s see how good they do,” Trump said. “Let’s see how they feel walking around without their guns and their bodyguards. In the meantime, nobody else can have the guns. ” So Trump has floated the idea of Clinton disarming her guards on many occasions before. And Trump supporters will wonder why this is suddenly news. You can see the cries of media bias now. But it’s clear that what Trump said Friday night went beyond what he’d said previously. The ”specter of violence” raised was much more directly. When Trump said, ”Let’s see what happens to her,” and ”It would be very dangerous,” he’s taking things to a new level and talking about the actual result  —   not just Clinton allegedly putting her money where her mouth is on how guns aren’t safe. That’s even further than he went with his very oblique and suggestive ”Second Amendment people” quip about how such people might be the only ones who could stop Clinton from appointing liberal judges. ”If she gets to pick her judges: Nothing you can do, folks,” Trump said in August, adding: “Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don’t know. But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day. ” This is classic Trump. He takes something old and dips it in controversy, letting the media raise a fuss about it. Then he accuses us of being too hard on him, and his supporters point out that he has said similar things before. The funny thing is that Trump seems to think this works for him. He probably thinks that because the presidential race is close. But that’s not because Trump is doing much right; it’s because his opponent has her own problems. A huge majority of Americans don’t think Trump has the temperament to be president, and they don’t trust him nearly as much with things like the nuclear codes. This is a big part of the reason. In the end, mere hours after trying to put the birther sideshow behind him, Trump created another one. And to be clear, there’s very good reason for that."
215434,When will millennials start liking Hillary Clinton?,Washington Post,Catherine Rampell,F,2016-09-22,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160923001042/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/when-will-millennials-start-liking-hillary-clinton/2016/09/22/4f2e0de8-80fb-11e6-a52d-9a865a0ed0d4_story.html,"Millennials are souring on Hillary Clinton. Again. Not that they were ever so sweet on her to begin with, at least relative to how they swooned over other Democrats. Both Bernie Sanders in the recent primary campaign, and Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 general elections, received far more love from young voters. But in any case, Clinton’s already weak millennial support has gotten much weaker in the past month.  Still, there’s good reason to believe they’ll come around, even if they do so grudgingly. First, the data. Several new polls suggest young voters  —   a   but nonetheless key component of the Democratic coalition  —   are abandoning Clinton in droves.  Quinnipiac, for example, found last month that Clinton had a big fat   lead over Donald Trump among      voters (48 percent to 24 percent). Now that margin has shriveled to just five percentage points (with Clinton at 31 percent, Trump at 26 percent).  Nationwide Fox News polls of registered voters also found that Clinton’s lead has narrowed to nine points,  from 27 points in late July and early August. And a USC   Angeles Times national poll has Clinton’s August lead not only disappearing but reversing, with Trump now ahead among millennials by six points. There were outliers, but the trend was clear. Polls in battleground states have likewise shown Clinton’s lead among millennial voters shrinking. In Michigan, for example, Clinton’s   August lead among young voters has shriveled to just seven points. Clinton has just 31 percent of the youth vote there, compared with Trump’s 24 percent.  In most of these polls, the young supporters ditching Clinton seem to be shifting not to Trump but to   candidates, particularly Libertarian Gary Johnson. The Michigan poll has Johnson tied with Trump; the national Quinnipiac poll actually has Johnson slightly ahead of Trump among   voters. These trends have been met with liberal   and   plus a lot of sanctimonious scolding of Kids These Days. How dare these ungrateful young hooligans turn their backs on the only serious candidate who actually cares about their issues! Are they really too young to remember the horrors that resulted when Ralph Nader played the spoiler in 2000? Quoth one columnist, “I know you’re young, but grow up!” The Clinton campaign seems to have gone into emergency millennial mollification mode, too.  That means a flurry of college visits, including from progressive heartthrobs such as Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Michelle Obama. The Clinton campaign explicitly advertised these events as an appeal to prodigal young voters.  The surrogate speeches haven’t always gone according to plan, though. Obama’s speech at George Mason University was at one point met with chants of “four more years”; her stumping apparently got the crowd pumped for the wrong politician. The Clinton campaign has thus also been desperately seeking coverage in   media. She whipped up an inane essay for Mic titled “Hillary Clinton: Here’s What Millennials Have Taught Me. ” (The tl;dr lesson: Millennials are totes awesome.) And she sat for an awkward, if amusing, interview on “Between Two Ferns” with actor Zach Galifianakis.   In my view, all the kvetching, cajoling and clowning around in the world are unlikely to move young voters. But you know what might? Numbers. Several recent polls, anyway, suggest that younger voters are much more likely to see a Clinton presidency as a fait accompli. Per Quinnipiac, 71 percent of voters younger than 35 believe Clinton will win in November; just 49 percent of voters older than 65 believe the same. YouGov also finds that 58 percent of voters under 30 expect a Clinton victory, versus 47 percent of those over 65. If you believe a Clinton presidency is inevitable, then casting a ballot for a   candidate probably doesn’t feel like it has much consequence. It’s a mere protest vote, a victimless expressive gesture, like angrily tweeting into the void, kneeling during the national anthem or, I don’t know, sending unhinged hate mail to unsuspecting columnists.  But a tighter race  —   one, ironically, made tighter largely because of millennial defections from the Clinton camp  —   changes the calculus. It’s riskier to “throw away” your vote, either by supporting someone who has no chance of winning or by abstaining from the polls altogether.  See, millennials may not adore Clinton, but they really, really hate Trump. Six in 10 young voters view him “strongly” unfavorably, and the same share describe him as “racist. ” Don’t be surprised if their   crushes start to fade as the prospect of President Trump begins to feel all too terrifyingly real.

215441,This is why Hillary Clinton isn’t ’50 points ahead’ — or even 10 points ahead,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-09-22,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160923001042/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/22/this-is-why-hillary-clinton-isnt-50-points-ahead-or-even-10-points-ahead/,"“Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” Hillary Clinton asked rhetorically on Wednesday, echoing a question she surely gets all the time  —   and perhaps legitimately wonders herself. It’s a question that seems to come up over and over again among   Americans: How, given all of the things  —   they would argue racist and sexist  —   that Donald Trump has said, is this race as close as it seems? How has an experienced politician like Clinton not buried her opponent by now? Some blame the media for taking it too easy on Trump and giving him all kinds of free publicity  —   or for not calling him out more directly for telling lies. But that theory ignores that fact that Trump has been, and remains, the most unpopular presidential candidate in modern American history. As many as   of Americans don’t like him. And yet, he’s still close. Why? Why is Clinton not much further ahead in a race that her supporters  —   and many in the media  —   thought was   ? A few reasons: 1) Rank partisanship If you’re a   presidential nominee in this day and age in American politics, you’ve frankly got to work pretty hard to get less than 40 or even 45 percent of the vote. Because we’re just that partisan. A presidential race has been decided by double digits only once since 1972. And since that Richard   landslide in ‘72, neither party has taken less than 40 percent of the vote in a   race. In fact, neither side has taken less than 45 percent in a   race since Ronald Reagan. (This excludes two of the past seven races, of course  —   both Bill Clinton victories featuring Ross Perot as an independent candidate. But it likely would have held up in Perot’s absence.) In fact, if you think back to 2008, Barack Obama’s    popular vote victory was treated as a landslide. A big reason for this is that there are simply fewer and fewer swing voters. The Monkey Cage’s John Sides in November pointed to a study by Michigan State University’s Corwin Smidt showing the number of swing voters  —   labeled here as “floating voters”  —   has declined from as much as 15 percent of the population in the late 1960s to about 5 percent of voters today.     Part of the reason is that the two parties themselves have become more ideologically polarized. The day of the conservative Southern Democrats and the liberal Northern Republicans have long passed. The Democratic Party is now clearly the party of the left and the Republicans of the right. The result is that voters in states and districts around the country are voting for the same party for president, Senate, U. S. House and many other offices. While more than 100 congressional districts voted for a different party’s candidate for president and House in every election between 1956 and 1996, just 25 did so in 2012.    Via Vital Statistics on Congress  The point is that, whether through the parties becoming more polarized or people becoming more polarized (or both) voters are much more predictable when it comes to definitely pulling the lever for the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. Trump certainly has his faults  —   and his   unfavorable rating proves it  —   but he hasn’t alienated that   percent. And he probably never will. 2) Enthusiasm Beyond predictable partisanship, there’s the matter of turnout and who can actually get their supporters to the polls. And when it comes to doing that, it helps to have enthusiasm. Right now, Trump may have more of it. A Washington   News poll earlier this month showed that while 46 percent of Trump backers were “very enthusiastic” about voting, just 33 percent of Clinton backers said the same. And 93 percent of Trump backers were certain to vote in November, as compared with 80 percent of Clinton backers.   For whatever reason, Clinton voters have mostly just seemed less excited about this election. And that’s perhaps why the growing number of polls surveying “likely voters” rather than “registered voters” show numbers for Trump. The average of all   polls on Huffington Post Pollster shows Clinton up by 3. The average of all   polls, though, shows her up by 1. Would more enthusiasm suddenly mean Clinton would be ahead by 10 points? No. But it’s arguably making this a closer race for the time being. And it’s also a reflection of another factor that is preventing a Clinton blowout win, which is . .. 3) Hillary Clinton The big reason this election isn’t a blowout right now may be Hillary Clinton herself. Trump’s image numbers are bad enough that a candidate with even middling numbers of his or her own would probably be leading him by a substantial margin. But Clinton’s numbers are also bad, and it makes the race close. In fact, the most recent Washington   News poll showed about as many registered voters had an unfavorable opinion of her (59 percent) as disliked Trump (60 percent). Her favorable rating (38 percent) was also basically indistinguishable from his (37 percent).     Clinton supporters, of course, will gladly blame these numbers on the media’s coverage of their candidate  —   particularly her email server and the Clinton Foundation, which they believe to be overblown. But her numbers have been in steady decline for years  —   with a brief respite during her time as a highly popular secretary of state. Clinton is running against a highly flawed opponent who has done plenty to hurt himself in this race. She also happens to be running to continue the policies of a suddenly quite popular incumbent Democratic president in Barack Obama. So perhaps she should be further ahead. (Obama himself has offered some theories as to why she isn’t, including partisanship and sexism. “This should not be a close election, but it will be, and the reason it will be is not because of Hillary’s flaws,” he told supporters at a recent fundraiser.) But the idea that this race would ever have been a complete blowout for her was always  . It’s just not how politics in this country work these days, and it ignores the fact that Clinton has long been a very polarizing politician in her own right."
215458,The real question this debate: Who are Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump?,Washington Post,Kathleen Parker,F,2016-09-23,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160924002636/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-real-question-this-debate-who-are-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump/2016/09/23/8797b6f6-81d3-11e6-a52d-9a865a0ed0d4_story.html,"It’s here, at last. The showdown we’ve all been waiting for: Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump.  For what seems like years now, we’ve been building up to this moment  —   the ultimate battle of the sexes. The first woman vs. the last man. For days, talking heads and pundits have been telling us what to look for. (Ink on Clinton’s palm? Small receivers planted in Trump’s hair?) Moderator Lester Holt has released his topics for Monday night  —   “America’s Direction,” “Achieving Prosperity” and “Securing America”  —   throwing Twitter into a tizzy of tart translations. Commentators and consultants have discussed ad nauseam what each candidate must do. They’ve offered the questions they think Holt should ask. Is there anyone left in America who doesn’t know what each candidate thinks and what they’re going to say?  The only surprise would be if Trump were suddenly fluent in policy particulars and Clinton started making faces and giving the   every time she thought she was winning.  Is anyone really going to change his or her mind based on what the candidates say Monday as opposed to what they said last week? Trump lovers are set in stone, as are Clinton haters. That’s one voting bloc. Clinton supporters (I don’t think there are many lovers around) are solid and entrenched, as are those who find Trump utterly unfit to be president. It’s all over but for showing up at the polls. Thus, the debate won’t really be about substance. It will be a    event  —   entertainment pure and simple. To the extent there’s a contest, it will be one of senior superlatives. Who’s smartest? Funniest? Quickest? Deepest? Most important, whose voice do you want to listen to for the next four years?  Questions of substance  —   who is going to keep us safe, build our economy, stanch the flow of immigrants, rally the troops, protect the innocent and elderly  —   have been asked hundreds of times in a variety of forums. What will make this or any other debate any different? What would sway the swayable, whoever those poor people are? Everything you need to know for Monday’s debate, you learned in high school  —   how to size up a person, get their gist, seek their weak spot and watch closely how they handle themselves in the tightest sort of squeeze  —   exposed as 200 million eyeballs (that’s assuming two per person) are watching.  Yes, of course, the answers matter, but at this point in our    election cycle, the last laps are about persistence, strength,   and one’s own humanity. Out here in the bleachers, human nature rules the ward. An angry country fed up with pretty much everything can’t be seduced or persuaded by a fraud or a fake. There just isn’t any patience left for that sort of thing. The courtship is long over.  Showing viewers who they really are is all that’s left. This, I think, is where people are today. The moderator who can get to the core of the individual rather than simply elicit yet another rote recitation of either facts or nonsense, as the case may be, will have provided a public service indeed. So who are Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump? We know their résumés. We know their histories. We know their foibles and weaknesses. But do we know their characters? Clinton has asked who the American people want to answer that 3 a. m. call. In past campaigns, other questions have arisen. With whom would you leave your children? With whom would you like to grab a beer? Hands down, Clinton gets the kids, and Trump gets the tab.  These are somewhat silly questions, obviously, but human beings aren’t so terribly complex after all. Most people think they’re pretty good judges of character. Most times, they can’t put a finger on what precisely tips the scale or sends the signal that this or that person is a mover or a maker.  It may be a simple gesture, a slight movement at a specific time, a tightening of the jaw, a sag of the shoulder, eyes that can’t stay with you. Or it can be something more discreet  —   an absence of presence, a missing something you sense rather than see.  This is why polls aren’t the final word  —   or debates, so full of words, the endgame. Whatever Clinton and Trump do say, Monday night will likely be more about watching than listening  —   and who these two are seen to be.

215532,5 things to watch at the presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,Washington Post,Robert Costa,M,2016-09-26,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20160927003507/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/26/5-things-to-watch-at-the-presidential-debate-between-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump/,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will meet Monday at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N. Y. for their first presidential debate  —   the    culmination of months of fierce political battle. They will bring their own aims and political baggage, their own styles and quirks. The clash between Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Trump, the Republican nominee, represents the most dramatic showdown yet in an already raucous election season, as well as an opportunity for these universally known personalities to reintroduce themselves to voters that have deep reservations or remain undecided. And although the unpredictable has a tendency to become the headline, the issues and questions hovering over this debate have been calcifying for weeks. Here are five things to watch.     Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a rally last week in Aston, Pa. (Jonathan  )  1. Trump’s attacks For the past month, Trump has had the longtime   investigator David Bossie at his side, providing him with reams of information about past controversies. And during that period, Trump has mostly focused his Clinton critique on her record in office and inability to fix what he considers the country’s chronically broken political and economic system. But more than once, he has delved into the tabloid aspects of Clinton history, such as when he tweeted tauntingly Saturday about inviting Gennifer Flowers, who said she had an affair with Bill Clinton, to the debate. Monday night will provide a window into the extent to which Bossie is influencing Trump and whether he has internalized his adviser’s opposition research about   scandals and more recent issues. Can Trump pack together points on Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street firms and her bygone advocacy for trade deals into a populist rebuke? Or does he throw around terms such as “Benghazi” and “her emails” with flair but little elucidation? For Trump, weaving together the many threads on the Clintons’ time in the White House and after into an argument that is both intelligible and damning won’t be a natural undertaking for a candidate who relishes extemporaneous zingers and confrontation. But it may be necessary for success against the polished Clinton, who has swatted back Republican criticism for decades. The risks and rewards for Trump are plenty. If he can calmly frame Clinton as untrustworthy and an agent of the financial and political establishments, he could leave the stage having given some voters pause about her character and associations. If he is scattered and conspiratorial, and neglects to use his most potent material, he could leave voters wondering more about his coherence than her record.

Y. (Andrew   Pressphoto Agency)  2. Temperament  Trump’s innate understanding of what makes for electrifying political theater was crucial to his success during the crowded Republican primary debates. On Monday, he will be on a far more subdued stage, staring back at one opponent, and with the question of his temperament at the fore. Viewers will be evaluating whether he seems “presidential,” that enigmatic blend of qualities befitting a statesman, chief executive and commander in chief. Even those who chuckled at his quips or cheered him in the primaries may now wonder whether he should be entrusted with the nuclear codes. How Trump handles the setting  —   and especially how he responds to Clinton’s likely provocations  —   could shape the consensus on his performance. Will he become distracted and furious if Clinton supporter Mark Cuban, a billionaire Trump frenemy, is smirking in the front row? Will he lose his cool if Clinton baits him into an exchange about his net worth, his charitable foundation, his bankruptcies or Trump University? A flurry of   outbursts that veer into the awkward or the strange could doom him. A night where he balances crackling showmanship and a reassuring disposition could lead to gains. Clinton’s temperament is less of a factor because she is so well known as a seasoned and measured political actor. But her reactions to Trump’s shots will be a significant test. Being dismissive about personal comments about her stamina or Bill Clinton’s affairs, for instance, could win her sympathy from voters who consider him out of bounds. Dismiss him entirely, however, and she risks her incredulity being seen as aloofness, as Al Gore’s famous yawning sighs about George W. Bush became a touchstone in 2000.    Hillary Clinton addresses voters at Temple University in Philadelphia last week. (Melina   Washington Post)  3. Clinton’s vulnerabilities  Ask undecided voters what they think of Clinton and they use words such as corrupt and untrustworthy, uninspiring and disingenuous. On Monday, she not only has to convince these voters that Trump is unfit to be president, but also that she would be a president they could support and admire. Clinton’s team considers this   moment her best chance to do so, not so much by addressing her vulnerabilities directly but by selling her attributes and accomplishments. For the past month, she has laid the groundwork for this approach, trying to raise her standing on questions such as trustworthiness and likeability in several speeches. Still, one variable will be whether Clinton shows any contrition on the issue of her private email server as secretary of state. That controversy has dogged Clinton’s campaign for more than a year, and her defensive, strained and lawyerly handling has fed the impression that she is covering something up or hiding the complete story. How Clinton handles questions about her emails from the moderator and, perhaps more important, forceful allegations of wrongdoing from Trump could be critical to her cause. Will she sound overly defensive? Or will she own up to some mistakes and find a way to diffuse the issue? More broadly, Clinton backers call her disciplined but some voters do view her as overly scripted, in contrast to the more freewheeling Trump. And those voters may be watching to see whether she comes across as authentic and capable of spontaneity, even if her supporters say such issues are frivolous or sexist. If her recent interview with comedian Zach Galifianakis on his “Between Two Ferns” online series is any indication, Clinton will strive Monday to show some levity, without going too far.      These six moments from the 2016 primary debates have the context you need before you see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump go    in the first general election debate Sept. 26 (Sarah   Washington Post)     [We simulated a   debate, now you get to choose the questions]   4. Ideology Trump’s campaign has skewered the normal partisan boundaries of modern presidential politics, putting a New York   mogul and    atop the GOP ticket with a pitch that strays from party orthodoxy. Unlike many Republican leaders, Trump isn’t inclined toward a hawkish worldview and he wants to preserve federal entitlement programs such as Medicare and opposes free trade. Trump’s challenge will be articulating his jumbled ideology and describing his positions as an overture to voters in the center and on the left who are frustrated with both political parties. If he is unable to do so, he risks being defined solely on Clinton’s terms and as a   on immigration who speaks in incendiary ways about race and ethnicity. That would be a lost opportunity for Trump’s   campaign. Clinton’s ideological dance will be similarly complicated, although her challenge will be less about defining herself to the electorate at large than in rousing liberal voters who remain skeptical, notably young voters. Without lurching so far to the left that she loses her appeal to moderates, Clinton will have to convince the backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and those tempted by   candidates that she embodies their desire for advancements on social and economic policy. Although Trump’s temperament has been Clinton’s main target, she may try to fully connect him with the Republican Party and all that entails ideologically, linking him with the unpopular congressional GOP agenda to restrict abortion rights and overhaul Social Security, as a means of erasing his   as something different from them.    NBC ”Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt (Jose Luis   Bee via Associated Press)  5. The moderator Who is responsible for correcting falsehoods and exaggerations, the debate moderator, Lester Holt, or the opposing candidate? This is one of the night’s looming questions, and both the Clinton and Trump campaigns, and their supporters, are strongly advocating different approaches that are shaping early perceptions. Trump’s camp says the moderator should simply ask questions; Clinton’s says the moderator has a responsibility to interject and educate the audience. Her advisers say she will be prepared to call out any lie by Trump, although she’d rather see Holt intervene. Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said it would be unfair for Clinton to have to play “traffic cop” as she makes her case to voters. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, also on ABC, dismissed “these virtual  ” at news organizations and said moderators should not do the bidding of campaigns. According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan host, moderators are supposed to ask questions to spur discussion, but the onus falls on the candidates to correct each other. Perception will be everything in the expected disputes over what Holt, the host of NBC’s “Nightly News,” does (or doesn’t do). This will be particularly true if Trump, who routinely makes inaccurate or misleading assertions, is seen as advancing his candidacy without being called on a particularly glaring statement, or if Clinton is seen escaping scrutiny or being overly subject to it. The country’s eyes will be on Holt and whether he can deftly navigate the sparring, all while not appearing too hot or too cold in his willingness to step in."

So many armchair politicians say those words and fail to follow through. Not McMullin. The independent candidate for president threw his hat in the ring more than a month ago and has been taken seriously ever since. Even conservative columnist Erick Erickson declared last week, “McMullin’s candidacy is not the lesser of an evil, but an alternative against evil. ” That’s a stamp of approval that should gain more currency for other conservatives after Donald Trump’s disaster of a debate against Hillary Clinton on Monday. In the ninth episode of “Cape Up,” McMullin made a case for himself as a suitable alternative candidate, saying, “I heard a preacher the other day say, ‘If you’re voting for the lesser of two evils, you’re still voting for evil.’ ” McMullin is no fan of Clinton, the Democratic nominee. But he is especially critical of Trump, whose candidacy, he believes, not only has damaged the Republican Party but also endangers the nation.

These are people, he said, “who know what a danger [Trump] is to this country and how much damage he is doing to the country [with] the promotion of the racist   movement, as well as ushering in this authoritarian view of leadership that he . . . admires so much. ”   [Watch: Evan McMullin on ‘the right to pursue happiness’]   “I think we need a new conservative movement,” McMullin told me. That movement “would embrace the cause of individual liberty,” “would be inclusive” and “embrace diversity. ” Case in point, his view on Black Lives Matter. When I asked him what he hears in the phrase, he said, “I hear a statement of fact. . . . As a white male, there are certain challenges that African Americans face that I don’t understand because I haven’t lived them. ”    Evan McMullin talks with The Post’s Jonathan Capehart on the “Cape Up” podcast last week. (Carol   Washington Post)  McMullin’s inclusive and empathetic vision of conservatism is identical to one articulated by Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, in his 2015 book “The Conservative Heart. ” Because Republican conservative leadership failed to follow that vision, McMullin believes the GOP was “vulnerable to what I’d consider a hostile takeover by Donald Trump. ” McMullin is a former covert CIA operative who takes a dim view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who along with his government, “are clearly attacking our democracy  …    in the same way that they’ve attacked the democracies in Europe. ” After detailing Putin’s process, which includes fomenting divisions along racial and ethnic lines, I couldn’t help but ask McMullin if he thought Trump was either a witting or unwitting Putin agent. “Oh there’s no question,” he said. “There’s absolutely no question. ” [“Cape Up” Episode 1: Michael Steele: The GOP needed Trump’s nomination] That was part of a rhetorical world tour of the challenges facing the nation and the next president. Syria? China? North Korea? Russia? All of McMullin’s responses were thoughtful and befitting someone with national security experience. But they also had me wondering how what he proposed was radically different from what President Obama is doing or tried doing. I also wondered how McMullin would win. He won’t be on the ballot in all 50 states on Election Day. And his push to deny Clinton or Trump the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency strikes me as dangerous given the   House would then decide who won. “If we’re able to do it that will, I believe, reset the election. And then there will be a true   race between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and me,” McMullin told me. “And I think we will then have a fair opportunity to make the case to the American people that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both unfit for the responsibilities they seek and that I am a better choice for president for this country. ” [Listen to past episodes of “Cape Up” on iTunes or Stitcher!]    We talked about other things. McMullin’s hardscrabble upbringing in Washington state. The movie that sparked McMullin’s childhood desire to join the CIA. How he came to eventually work at the agency.

Now, her Republican opponent Donald Trump and his surrogates have signaled that he may bring up the subject in the next presidential debate, treacherous territory, given his own infidelities and treatment of women.

Initially, my focus was on commercializing the Internet, expanding access and putting appropriate rules of the road in place. In the past decade, my focus shifted to encouraging   policies that foster innovation, generate jobs, help   and create opportunity. I was proud to work with a Democratic president and a Republican House to help get the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act passed four years ago, and I have spent countless hours meeting with members of both parties on immigration reform, patent reform and    economic ideas. Despite my active engagement on policy, however, I’ve tried to steer clear of politics. I’ve avoided endorsing candidates or making big contributions to campaigns. I’ve wanted to be nonpartisan, able to work with people on both sides of the aisle. Indeed, I’ve been troubled by the   that has defined our politics of late, and by the resulting gridlock that has set in. The United States faces many challenges, but in my view our greatest threat may not be external forces but rather our inability to work together to move our country forward.     Here are the key moments from the first 2016 presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Sept. 26. NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt moderated the debate at Hofstra University in New York. (Sarah   Washington Post)   So my inclination is to continue to stay out of politics and continue to quietly build working relationships with both Republicans and Democrats. I’d prefer to be positioned as a builder of bridges and consensus. But I’ve decided to make an exception this election. I have concluded that I cannot sit on the sidelines this year. At this pivotal time, the choice is too important.  I’ve decided to back Hillary Clinton for president for four reasons. First, I think she’d be better for our economy, especially with respect to innovative technology and  . Donald Trump knows business, but his campaign has been   on the economy and oddly absent of ideas to spur creation of the jobs of the future. Clinton understands what we need to help start businesses and will invest in education, advanced manufacturing and basic research. She’s not promising a return to a bygone era  —   she’s focused on making our economy strong for our children and their children. These   policies are essential to ensure continued U. S. economic leadership.  Second, Clinton is right on immigration. To win in the global economy, our country must win the global battle for talent. Immigrants don’t take U. S. jobs; they create them. More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were started by immigrants or their children: Think how many fewer jobs we’d have in the United States if these entrepreneurs and their parents had been kept out by a wall. Trump’s harsh policies will cost us jobs, and his even harsher rhetoric will chase away immigrant families whose children could grow up to be the next Steve Jobs (whose father was a Syrian refugee) or Sergey Brin (an immigrant himself). Third, while Trump has been largely silent on technology issues facing the new economy, Clinton has put forward an agenda that has won considerable acclaim among technology leaders. She wants to appoint a chief innovation adviser, expand science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education and more. And she shares my view that it’s not enough to support a booming Silicon Valley  —   we need policies that promote the “rise of the rest”: a spread of   to all parts of our country. We need to level the playing field so anybody, anywhere, has a shot at the American dream. Fourth, I agree with Clinton on the need to control the deficit. Despite his populist rhetoric, Trump wants to give huge tax breaks to people like me, the very folks who have benefited greatly from the innovation economy, while many others have been left behind. In the process he would blow up our deficit and make the economy more unequal. I agree we need to simplify the tax code, but if we are going to give tax relief, let’s make sure it is in incentives for   to grow and create jobs.         Y.

215642,"Before 6 a.m., Donald Trump proved Hillary Clinton’s point about his temperament",Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-09-30,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161001000959/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/30/before-6-a-m-donald-trump-proved-hillary-clintons-point-about-his-temperament/,"While you were probably still sleeping, the 2016 Republican presidential nominee encouraged all of us to check out a ”sex tape” and offered a baseless conspiracy theory about his opponent helping the woman from the alleged sex tape get citizenship so she could take him down. And in doing so, Donald Trump did everything Hillary Clinton could have hoped he would, drawing out a    story about Alicia Machado, making things up and  —   above all  —   reinforcing all those very real questions about whether he has the temperament to be president. Here are the tweets, over a   span between 5:14 a. m. and 5:30 a. m. Eastern time:   Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an ”angel” without checking her past, which is terrible!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016     Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016     Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U. S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016   There are certainly aspects of Machado’s past that no campaign would like for its surrogates to have; specifically, she was accused in 1998 of driving the getaway car in a murder plot and then of threatening a judge. But Trump is once again playing    with the facts. There have been plenty of rumors of a ”sex tape,” and Machado has been described as a ”porn star” by some. But, according to Snopes (some censored yet still NSFW images at that link) this is based on nothing more than Internet rumors and some grainy,   footage of Machado apparently having sex under the covers while she was a reality show contestant.   [Why Donald Trump tweets late at night (and very early in the morning)]   Then there’s Trump’s peddling of the theory that Clinton helped Machado ”become a U. S. citizen so she could use her in the debate.” This doesn’t make sense, given Machado became a U. S. citizen in August and the application process generally takes at least six months. So Clinton would have had to hatch this plot in early 2016  —   to know just as the primaries were beginning that she would face Trump in the debates and that Machado would figure into them. (But, again, we’re applying facts to a conspiracy theory that’s apparently based upon nothing.) More than anything, though, here we have the Republican presidential nominee, less than 40 days before the election, doing the very same things that have led voters to severely question his temperament.      At the Sept. 26 presidential debate, Hillary Clinton knocked Donald Trump for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Here’s what you need to know about Machado. (Monica   Washington Post)   And however well Trump is doing in the    polls  —   and no matter how much he says that his temperament is great  —   it’s a very real concern for voters. A New York   News poll earlier this month showed just 31 percent of registered voters say Trump has the ”right kind of temperament and personality to be a good president.” Fully 64 percent said he did not. That’s almost   of the electorate. As much as the media gets attacked for not being hard enough on Trump, it’s clear that a strong majority of Americans have processed the many controversial things he’s said, including his comments about women and his tendency to get drawn into petty feuds. Some people can get past it and are still voting for him, yes  —   but it’s a clear liability. And it’s a liability the Clinton campaign seems to be intent on driving home in the final weeks of the campaign  —   apparently with the able assistance of Trump himself. Clinton said at the Democratic National Convention two months ago: ”A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” Whether you trust Trump with nuclear weapons is one thing. But what’s become clear as day over the past week is that Trump can indeed be baited. The Clinton campaign has done it repeatedly  —   on Mark Cuban, on taxes, etc.    and he’s taken it, hook, line and sinker. We’re now on Day No. 5 of the Machado story. That’s in no small part due to Donald Trump. Further reading:  Hillary Clinton is trolling Donald Trump. And it’s working.

215649,I’ve come to admire Hillary Clinton. What on earth happened?,Washington Post,Danielle Allen,F,2016-09-30,2016.0,9.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161001000959/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ive-come-to-admire-hillary-clinton-what-on-earth-happened/2016/09/30/4a3a92a8-85c3-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html,"Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post.       I admire Hillary Clinton. This is new for me. I have come to admire her only over the past year. Before Monday’s debate, she had already sealed the deal. But everything I have come to see was on display that evening: intelligence, fortitude,   discipline, strength and grace. Let me share my journey.     For almost twenty years, Hillary Rodham Clinton put her political aspirations on hold when she moved to Arkansas to marry Bill Clinton, who would become the country’s 42nd president. The former New York senator, secretary of state and Democratic nominee for president would be the first woman to hold the office if she is elected. (Jayne   Washington Post)   In the fall of 1992, after the Los Angeles riots, I cast my first vote in a presidential election. I had attended the Democratic National Convention in New York as a summer intern for National Review. I still remember Bill Clinton’s tediously long acceptance speech, and I voted for George H. W. Bush. That first vote was also my last at the presidential level for a Republican. I didn’t much like Bill then, but I didn’t like Hillary, either. I remember the interview about Gennifer Flowers. And weirdly, despite my general conservatism and aversion toward the pair, I also remember feeling betrayed as  over the course of the election, Hillary’s maiden name, Rodham, disappeared from view behind “Clinton. ” My college suitemates and I all planned to keep our maiden names when we got married. We didn’t know it then, but in that choice we were among an already shrinking breed.   I moved from betrayal to shock. I was appalled by Hillary Clinton’s leadership of the   policy initiative. I was flabbergasted that an unelected spouse could presume to function, in effect, as a legislator. This seemed to me the antithesis of what democracy is about: elections and political accountability. The Lewinsky affair   my slightly   sense of feminist betrayal  —   how could she stand for that humiliation?  —   and my sense that the Clintons treated the burdens and prerogatives of office too lightly. By the time Hillary Clinton ran in 2008, little had happened to change my mind. Then working on Obama field organizing teams in California taught me about the tight grasp that the Clinton machine held on local politicians. This didn’t make me feel any better about the United States’ power couple. Yet somehow between Clinton’s 2015 campaign announcement and the present, I’ve come to admire her. What on earth happened? Call me crazy, but I read her emails. Or at least, I read as many of them as I could. You try it. It’s no small task. And what blazes out of those emails above all is a combination of discipline and dedication to the U. S. cause. Then I started listening to her   events. The discipline and dedication were richly in evidence there, too. A vast number of her emails concern her schedule. As it happens, I’m obsessed with calendars. I’m a reasonably busy person myself, and I’ve been interested in efficiency and time management ever since as a child I read “Cheaper by the Dozen. ” I have never seen anything like Clinton’s discipline and efficiency. This is a woman who knows how to use her time to get things done. As a result, she has already won the greatest reward. As a working mom, she has a daughter who plainly, adoringly loves her. What’s more, this is a woman whose stamina is unlike anything I have ever seen. These should all be seen as virtues. But, of course, Clinton’s intense drive for efficiency has gotten her into a significant amount of trouble. Efficiency does indeed appear to me to be a real motivation behind her decision to take her email work onto a private server. And efficiency and discipline are no good if they are harnessed to the wrong aspirations. And here, one question about her lingers: Is all that discipline, that fierce drive, that exceptional dedication a commitment to the nation’s cause, or only to her own? How should we measure her devotion? Clinton has always thought of herself as a public servant, fighting for others. She began this campaign on just such terms. Her first slogan was “Fighting for us. ” The slogan was accurate in capturing her orientation toward commitment and service, but it had the demerit of pointing to herself, insisting on her own heroic credentials.  When Clinton in May changed her slogan to “Stronger Together,” I believe she finally made the United States itself her calling. She had identified our fundamental problem and publicly committed herself to working to solve it. We need to build a connected society on these shores, one in which  —   for all that we enjoy the pleasure of our own social groups  —   we also maximize ties across boundaries of difference. Achieving such a connected society is a necessary part of solving all of our other problems  —   especially after the damage to our social fabric brought about by this year’s political campaign and many acts of public violence. Clinton is simply right: We will be stronger together. A connected society is the necessary foundation for strength in a democracy. I have criticized Clinton this year  —   for trying to claim that she’s not a member of the establishment and for the remarkable and sometimes problematic entanglements of her family’s foundation. I lambasted her for overplaying the gender card. I have challenged her to move beyond her   orientation. Can she work with the National Governors Association, pulling an oar alongside it, rather than seeking to regulate states from above? I am ready to keep pressing those criticisms and to keep pushing Clinton in directions that hold out the greater hope for the achievement of a connected society. But because I have come to admire her, I will also vote for Clinton in November with enthusiasm and pleasure. I will even consider it a privilege to do so.

215706,53 percent of people in new WaPo-ABC poll say Hillary Clinton won the debate,Washington Post,Scott Clement,M,2016-10-02,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161003002548/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/02/poll-clinton-wins-debate-with-more-saying-trump-got-facts-wrong/,"Almost three times as many Americans say Hillary Clinton won last Monday’s debate than Donald Trump, with the Democratic nominee regaining a clear favorability advantage over the Republican, according to a new Washington   News poll. Clinton was also seen as sticking more to the facts during the debate, with far more saying she mainly got facts right than Trump (54 to 29 percent). A larger share said Trump got the facts wrong in the debate (47 percent) with just over 3 in 10 saying he lied on purpose. Just over 2 in 10 say Clinton misstated facts and lied on purpose (21 percent).     The debate appears to have had only a slight impact on each candidate’s popularity, though if anything it aided Clinton. Trump’s 34 percent favorable rating among all Americans is little changed from 35 percent before the debate, but his unfavorable mark has crept up from 59 to 64 percent. Clinton’s 45 percent mark is slightly above her   mark less than two weeks ago, while unfavorable opinions have ticked down an insignificant two points to 53 percent.    Trump’s net favorability rating of   (favorable minus unfavorable) trails Clinton’s   among adults overall; among registered voters, Trump’s net favorability is   compared with   for Clinton.  The   poll conducted Wednesday through Friday found Clinton was seen as the debate’s winner by a 53 to 18 percent margin; 17 percent said it was a draw while the rest had no opinion.     Clinton’s widely perceived victory is still not as lopsided as after the first debate between Romney and Obama in 2012, when nearly 7 in 10 registered voters thought Romney won. But her victory is clearer than after the first debate in 2008, when Obama was seen the winner over McCain by a   percent margin among registered voters.  Assessments of the debate’s winner vary sharply across partisan lines, though Democrats and independents are more apt to declare her victory. Fully 83 percent of Democrats say Clinton won compared with just 24 percent of Republicans, with independents in the middle at 50 percent. Fewer than half of Republicans think Trump won (45 percent) while 25 percent say it was a draw and the rest had no opinion. Factual accuracy was a recurring theme throughout the debate, with Clinton repeatedly criticizing Trump for factual inaccuracies. A Washington Post analysis found Trump made 10 questionable statements during the debate while Clinton made three.  [  the first   presidential debate] Perhaps unsurprisingly, partisans have very different perceptions of Clinton and Trump’s factual accuracy, though as with debate reactions overall Republicans criticized Trump more than Democrats knocked Clinton. When asked about Clinton, 53 percent of Republicans say she mainly got facts wrong during the debate, compared with 22 percent of independents and only 4 percent of Democrats. By contrast, 72 percent of Democrats say Trump mainly got the facts wrong, compared with 45 percent of independents and 15 percent of Republicans.    The poll found most people who thought Clinton and Trump got facts wrong suspect the candidates’ were lying intentionally rather than misstating facts by accident, but the level of suspicion differed for the two candidates.     Among those who say Clinton got the facts wrong, nearly 9 in 10 believe she lied on purpose while 11 percent think she did so unintentionally. But only about 7 in 10 of those who say Trump got facts wrong say Trump was lying intentionally, while about 3 in 10 think he was simply misstating facts. The Washington   News poll was conducted Sept.   among a random national sample of 630 adults reached on cellular and landline phones. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus five percentage points for overall results."
215800,Hillary Clinton is WAY overcompensating for Tim Kaine’s poor debate performance,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-10-05,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161007001117/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/05/hillary-clinton-is-way-overcompensating-for-tim-kaines-poor-debate-performance/,"Hillary Clinton wants to make one thing very, very clear: Tim Kaine was GREAT in Tuesday’s   debate. So good.  The best. He might have, in fact, added his name to the list of the world’s greatest debaters  —   right there alongside Abraham Lincoln, Socrates and Winston Churchill. This is what’s commonly known as overcompensating. Like if people say you are dumb, you try to wedge lots of big words into every sentence you write. That sort of sesquipedalianism is, of course, a tell for overcompensation. Witness the various reactions to Kaine’s performance that Clinton and her aides offered throughout the day Wednesday. At around 10 a. m. Clinton had emailed Kaine to say he had done well.   Hillary Clinton emailed Tim Kaine to congratulate him on his performance at #VPDebate, per and aide. They did not speak on the phone.  —   Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) October 5, 2016   Three hours later, Clinton had talked to Kaine on the phone to praise his heroic performance.   Hillary Clinton has now actually spoken to Tim Kaine on the phone, a convo her aide described as a ”love fest”  —   Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) October 5, 2016   Love. Fest. Uh huh. Here’s the reality: Kaine was not so good Tuesday night. (He wasn’t   bad. But he wasn’t great.) He spent the first 20 minutes of the debate amped up beyond belief, tripping over his words as he tried to rush them out before his allotted time expired. The next 20 minutes were relatively solid. But then Kaine decided he would interrupt Mike Pence every time the Indiana governor started to speak. And Kaine kept that up for the duration of the debate. It wasn’t a good look.  I named Kaine a loser in my   winners and losers column. Polling done among debate watchers seemed to confirm that Kaine had lost. Even the early spin out of the Clinton campaign was that Pence might have done some good for himself but that he hadn’t helped Trump in the least.  (I think that’s totally right!) But as Wednesday morning turned into Wednesday afternoon, it became clear that Kaine’s performance was coming under increasing criticism. Enter Clinton to insist that Kaine was, is and always will be the greatest debater this world  —   and this universe  —   will ever see. Don’t be fatuous, Hillary.              Caption   Here are some memorable quotes from the debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va."
215812,Hillary Clinton is a 68-year-old woman. And plenty of people hate her for it.,Washington Post,Petula Dvorak,F,2016-10-06,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161007001117/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/hillary-clinton-is-a-68-year-old-woman-and-plenty-of-people-hate-her-for-it/2016/10/06/fac46ee8-8bd9-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html,"A woman her age is supposed to be invisible. But Hillary Clinton, who is 68, refuses to disappear  —   and there is no shortage of people who despise her for it.  One voter at a Donald Trump rally described her to The Washington Post’s Jenna Johnson last week as “an angry, crotchety old hag. ” Trump, who isn’t exactly a spring chicken at age 70, claims Clinton lacks “stamina” and a “presidential look” and mocked her by acting out her stumble when she had pneumonia last month.  There’s misogyny, and then there’s the ageist misogyny that older women face. That under current runs very deep in our culture, and it’s one of the reasons the haters hate Hillary Clinton so deeply.  No one has talked about this much, but it’s a very real phenomenon in this election. The presidential nominee is confounding America because she represents a demographic that our culture secretly dislikes: older women. Everyone is guilty  —   even women themselves. Earlier polls showed that women Clinton’s age supported her, but younger women overwhelmingly supported Sen. Bernie Sanders. Maybe a wise grandpa made sense to them. But grandma? In the Oval Office? Shaking their heads. Does. Not. Compute. America worships youthful femininity, and our pop culture, if not our policies, idolizes mom. But what do we do with women once they’re not in either of those roles?  [She ditched her $   legal job after her ‘woman’s card only held her back]  We minimize and ignore them.  The older, wise woman has rarely had a starring role in the American story, beyond grandma and her cookies.  Plenty has been said about the way American women feel invisible once they reach 60, or 50, or  —   gack  —   even 40 today. We live in a culture where gorgeous Maggie Gyllenhaal is being told she’s invisible before she’s out of her 30s. “I’m 37, and I was told recently I was too old to play the lover of a man who was 55,” Gyllenhaal told the Wrap last year. “It was astonishing to me. It made me feel bad, and then it made me feel angry, and then it made me laugh. ” Most women in this age bracket remember the day they realized they had become invisible  —   that moment when the salesman pushing a   product looked right past them (even though they were the only person in his periphery who could actually afford the thing) when the clerk who was so chatty with the guy in front of them ignores them, when the intern treats them like a nonentity rather than an experienced superior. This isn’t only about the silencing of catcalls and other changes that come with age. Most women welcome the end of that attention. No, there’s something deeper and more inhumane about the dismissal.  There are plenty of countries for old men in Hollywood, though, according to a study on diversity in the entertainment industry released earlier this year by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. The study looked at 414 scripted movies, TV shows and digital series from major media companies that aired for 12 months between 2014 and 2015. Of the characters older than 40? Men got 80 percent of the roles.  Hello, Hollywood. There are older women besides Helen Mirren, Judi Dench and Meryl Streep. The situation is not too different for women at less glamorous workplaces. Another study  —   this one done last year by economists at the University of California at Irvine and Tulane University  —   looked at what happened when 40, 000 fake résumés carefully created to reflect a breadth of   experience were sent out for all kinds of jobs in cities across the country. And, yup, you guessed it. The number of callbacks for older women was way lower than for younger women. In some cases  —   administrative jobs  —   47 percent lower. But when it came to men, young and old got equal shots at jobs, wrinkles and ear hair be darned. Corporate America is the axis of evil when it comes to the   intersection. The tiny minority of respected, older women  —   just 4 percent of American Fortune 500 companies have female CEOs  —   have persisted and struggled and fought to earn positions of power that are usually an inevitable evolution for men of their skill and experience. They get talked over in meetings, interrupted and passed over for promotions, while usually being criticized for their ambition. Indra K. Nooyi, the    chief executive of PepsiCo, said she had to work twice as hard as the men around her.  Powerful older women? We apparently still can’t get our heads around this concept. Some of this is because women simply didn’t have the opportunity to get into the   collar workforce in a meaningful way until the 1970s. Congress is still only 19 percent female. Heck, we’re not even 100 years into women being able to vote.  [Born before women could vote, these    want Hillary to make history]  So it’s taking a while to accept that women can be maidens, mothers and, yes, leaders, too. What about all that wisdom, experience, the things they’ve seen, the things they know? Discarding older women means discarding years of knowledge and  .  The “grandmother hypothesis” even suggests that older women  —   and killer whales, the only other species to go through menopause  —   are biologically made to lead. That’s why their fertility ends, so they can get to the business of being leaders to all those creatures they created. But there is hope that the invisibility trend is fading. At 83, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is so respected, she’s got a street name: the Notorious R. B. G. Earlier this year, Ginsburg caused a furor by declaring Trump a “faker” and worrying about the impact on the country if he won the election. The Republican candidate quickly dismissed her, claiming her “mind is shot. ” Not really, Donald. It’s pretty clear that Ginsburg is sharp, brilliant and relentless. And she has also made it clear that she’s not going away anytime soon. Alongside her are Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 67; Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen, 70; and International Monetary Fund Chief Christine Lagarde, 60. It’s time to get used to it. Older women will be invisible no more.

Regnery. 256 pp. $27. 99 In the matter of the   Publishing Machine v. Hillary Rodham Clinton, I find for the defendant. During the final months of this singular presidential campaign, a batch of bestselling   books has emerged, offering the most nefarious interpretations of the Democratic nominee. They are the case for the prosecution, and their closing arguments leave nothing out  —   if it’s damning, or outlandish, or even contradictory, it’s here. In these pages, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state is invariably lawless and duplicitous, her record as horrifying as her hidden blueprint for national destruction. For those who already despise Clinton, these books affirm and amplify that loathing. “Hillary’s plan . . . is the enslavement of America,” writes Dinesh D’Souza in “Hillary’s America,” a sequel of sorts to “Obama’s America,” his 2012 fever dream. “We have become serfs not of a plantation owner, but serfs of the progressive state. ”    “We know all too well what a Hillary Clinton presidency would look like,” write Dick Morris and Eileen McGann in “Armageddon,” drawing on Morris’s time advising Bill and Hillary Clinton during the  . “Four long years of another bizarre Clinton administration, featuring the Clintons’ signature style of endless drama, interminable scandals, constant lies, blatant cronyism and corruption, incessant conflicts of interest, nepotism, pathological secrecy. ” Hillary Clinton is “volcanic, impulsive, enabled by sycophants, and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else . . . a cheerless grifter always on her scheming way,” writes former Secret Service officer Gary J. Byrne in “Crisis of Character,” a memoir of his time serving in the Clinton White House. And in “Guilty as Sin,” the notorious Clinton antagonist Edward Klein warns that “if Obama’s abuse of power shocks you, just wait: Hillary has promised to go even further. ” With chants of “lock her up” and “crooked Hillary” and simply “bitch” reverberating at Donald Trump’s rallies, these works have found a ready audience, already spending a collective 29 weeks on the New York Times bestsellers list. If these books and authors sum up your knowledge of the Democratic nominee, if they are all you believe of Clinton, I see how supporting her would seem impossible, regardless of her opponent’s overwhelming shortcomings. But if your feelings about her are even slightly more complex, if mistrust and admiration come together with every Clinton speech or shimmy, such attacks may backfire. These books have taken me beyond Clinton fatigue; they’ve given me Clinton fatigue fatigue. I’m now tired of being tired of Hillary Clinton. No doubt, Clinton has earned some of this criticism  —   but there’s no way she deserves all of it. The focus on her personality and appearance is crude and sexist. The obsession with her scandals, so well known for so long, leaves her accusers looking nearly as dirty as the accused, and more desperate. And her allegedly ruinous policy projects and worldview come across as more improbable than terrifying. *** Trump’s vile statements about women have become campaign controversies, but the insults fit well among the descriptions of Clinton scattered throughout these volumes. “She is old, and mean, and even her laugh is a witch’s cackle,” D’Souza writes of the first woman to become the presidential nominee of a major U. S. party. He asserts that in her youth, Clinton already came off as “ugly, petulant, and bitchy” and had a “sly, owlish” look, “with her terrible clothes and her peering eyes. ” Byrne, the former Secret Service officer, stresses Clinton’s “booming voice” and “maniacal laugh” (yes, the laugh is a constant obsession) and seems to imply that she is more vampire than witch. “Her true power was of the night  —   not the daylight,” he writes. Clinton’s temper is another recurring preoccupation. “She threw massive tantrums,” Byrne contends of her time as first lady, a habit he attributes to Clinton’s spoiled nature and an enabling,   staff. Klein notes that Clinton swears “like a drunken sailor,” and he offers examples of her supposed “vulgar mouth,” although his dubious quotations  —   always sourced anonymously to Clinton’s closest friends  —   make the candidate sound like a   gangster. “The motherf —  ers have tried to get Bill and me ever since we entered politics, and we’ve always come out smelling like roses,” Clinton supposedly said of the investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state. “I’m going to beat this FBI rap, too. ” Not only does this fail to resemble how any real human would talk, but it sounds nothing like the voice we encounter in the tens of thousands of Clinton emails that have been made public. (Her   must all be in the deleted ones.) Such fixation on physical appearance and foul language is less likely to pester a male candidate  —   for guys,    expletives are a sign of rugged leadership!  —   whereas strong female politicians must endure these charges, just as they endure speculation about their sexuality. Both D’Souza and Klein, for instance, raise “rumors” that Clinton is a lesbian. “I have to confess that I cannot refute this theory,” D’Souza offers, “but I believe it is unsubstantiated. ” Klein goes further: “Despite persistent rumors, and the testimony of at least one of Bill Clinton’s former girlfriends, no one has ever definitively proven that Hillary was or is a lesbian. ” Klein even suggests that Clinton aide Huma Abedin may be the candidate’s girlfriend and chastises the news media for not exploring the “intimate nature”of their relationship. Dismissing, refuting or even entertaining these notions only fulfills the authors’ purpose, which is not to prove anything but merely to plant the ideas deep in the minds of their readers. *** Of course, the news media has had no dearth of real Clinton scandals to report on over the years, and these authors relive each of them, from cattle futures to email servers. Unlike the scandals portrayed in the endless collection of   books, which often enter the realm of   (birtherism, secret Muslim allegiance and the like) many of the Clinton scandals are anchored in reality. With her unfailing secrecy and endless entanglements  —   it’s not like she can wipe that all away, like with a cloth or something  —   Clinton always gives these authors something to work with. Then they run with it, always magnifying the principal’s malevolence and culpability.    “Almost every single scandal in the Bill Clinton White House was caused by Hillary,” Morris and McGann write. “Travelgate, Whitewater, Filegate, her amazing windfall in the commodities futures market, the Health Care Task Force’s illegal secrecy, the household furniture and gifts taken from the White House to Chappaqua, Vince Foster’s suicide, Webb Hubbell’s disgrace  —   all Hillary scandals. ” If you’re too tender in years to get all the references (Webb Hubbell?) don’t worry; the authors are recommending a massive ICYMI effort. “The Republicans need to run a targeted campaign against Hillary among younger voters,” write Morris and McGann. “To those under 35, all the Hillary scandals are new. These voters, after all, were under 15 years of age when the Lewinsky scandal unfolded and were way too young to have followed Hillary’s misadventures over the years. ” [Here are all the things Hillary Clinton says she has spent her ‘entire adult life’ working on] Somehow, I can’t imagine that refreshers on Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings will rally millennials to the GOP cause. But in these authors’ telling, it may as well have been Hillary who was impeached by the House of Representatives. “Far from being a victim, Hillary is the enabler of her husband’s depredations,” writes D’Souza. “She covers up for Bill while at the same time going after the women he abuses. ” This didn’t just happen, he contends  —   it was the plan since they first met. As early as law school, Hillary recognized that “Bill’s degeneracy could work to her advantage,” D’Souza posits. “She could become his   artist and his    specialist. . . . In this way Hillary would make herself indispensable to Bill, and Bill would become increasingly dependent on her. ” D’Souza has the gallantry to admit that this scenario is “less a description than an interpretation. ” Translation: It’s made up. Such speculation is rampant in these volumes. “Could they actually be behind so many of the suspicious  —   or merely coincidental  —   deaths surrounding their activities?” Byrne asks about the former first couple. “Had they really killed Vince Foster? Was it even possible? It weighed on me. ” The 1993 death of Foster, a White House attorney and childhood friend of Bill Clinton, was ruled a suicide by multiple investigations, no matter what dark corners of the Internet still peddle theories of foul play. Writing a passage like that should weigh on Byrne. Heavily. In their prosecutorial zeal  —   Morris and McGann even try to   Hillary Clinton’s   extracurriculars  —   the books end up contradicting one another. Clinton lied about Benghazi, D’Souza writes, because she was lining up Libya reconstruction contracts for cronies and didn’t want people to think things were falling apart there. But she actually lied, Morris and McGann explain, because she didn’t want Americans to figure out that   was still a threat, despite Osama bin Laden’s death. So which is it? Why not both? Don’t forget that “for Hillary, lying is routine,” Morris and McGann assert. “It comes naturally  —   like breathing. ” [The flawed feminist case against Hillary Clinton] The books add little to the current controversies surrounding the Clinton campaign. On the emails, Klein purports to show that the Democratic nominee is “guilty as sin,” but adding words like “obvious” or “clearly” to that phrase doesn’t quite nail the case, and his assertions that Bill Clinton, the Obama White House and Attorney General Loretta Lynch pressured the FBI into exonerating Hillary are based largely on anonymous, secondhand descriptions of secret gatherings. Klein also relies on his own past   books, as well as the opinions of conservative commentators, as support for various assertions  —   convenient, if not quite journalistically sound. *** Most scandalous of all, the authors write, is Clinton’s policy agenda for America. While an objective reading of the   platform reveals a repetitive jumble of economic optimism and identity politics, in these books Clinton’s intentions are always wicked, totalitarian, immoral.    In “Hillary’s America,” D’Souza provides a history in which the Democratic Party is purveyor of all past, present and future atrocity in the United States  —   slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, discrimination, poverty  —   culminating in the person of Hillary Clinton. “All the evil schemes of her party have, in a sense, become consolidated into her own career and life,” writes D’Souza. “Hillary is, in this respect, the dark id of the Democratic Party. ” And her sinister objective is to steal our wealth, earnings and property through taxation; control our minds and bodies through   schools and health care; and offer African Americans just enough free stuff to win their votes but otherwise keep them subjugated on “a new plantation called the inner city. ” (Latinos, be warned: “Democrats are working overtime to create new Hispanic plantations called barrios. ”) So don’t be fooled by Clinton’s faux concern for the little guy. “Hillary’s progressivism uses the bogus chants of ‘inequality’ and ‘social justice’ to implement   and   schemes much more expansive than anything previously attempted,” D’Souza writes. [This is the closest thing we’ve ever had to a Hillary Clinton political manifesto] Morris and McGann offer similarly harsh visions of Clinton’s policy plans, linking them to her odious personality. “Combine her unmistakable character flaws with her zealous commitment to four more years of Obama’s unconstitutional, overreaching,   prointernational, socialist policies that will annihilate the core of America, and you get a feel for exactly what a Hillary administration would be like,” they conclude. “It would be one we might never recover from. ” They also claim that Clinton is too much of a warmongering hawk to be commander in chief, but also far too weak on terrorism; she is an inveterate   but also far too rigid and pigheaded in her views. And they barely pause to note the inconsistencies. Klein’s concerns can be less wonky than prudish. He frets that Clinton’s malign influence would further America’s slide into what he calls a “decadent society,” with current signs of decadence including generalized female weight gain, the proliferation of tattoos (“once limited to sailors and members of biker gangs”) and deteriorating dress codes, with now, even at work, people attired “as if in imitation of Shaggy of  . ”  . *** There is little consternation in these works for the potential decadence of a Trump presidency. When they regard the Republican nominee at all, they are generous with praise and unstinting with the benefit of the doubt. “Trump escapes distracting details and focuses on objectives  —   the big picture  —   using talented people around him to map out the path to achieving them,” rave Morris and McGann. “He will get things done. ” They note his “ ” mind, his “uncanny” knowledge of policy issues and his “  message. ” It’s almost like they’re hoping for consulting gigs from the Trump White House. [I just   eight books by Donald Trump. Here’s what I learned.] D’Souza acknowledges the frequent criticism of Trump’s fascistic tendencies, but he mainly repeats it to pivot to his charge that the Democrats  —   and by extension, Clinton  —   are the true fascists. And Klein embraces Trump for the simple reason that he could free America of Clinton: “Her wooden inauthenticity and unlikeability would make her the perfect foil for      Trump. ” Together, these titles seek to expose, recall or fabricate the worst possible version of Hillary Clinton, while disregarding, even embracing, the vices of her rival. So are they just part of that vast   conspiracy Clinton has long feared? After all, when former consultants and Secret Service officers are writing books eviscerating you, you’ve earned the right to a little paranoia. But if it is a plot, it is a messy, contradictory and possibly   one, more of Twitter trolls than of cunning conspirators. The case they make against Hillary comes down to the fact that she’s Hillary, with all the instant revulsion that name is supposed to conjure. But that works only if for you, as for them, hating Hillary Clinton comes naturally. You know, like breathing.

We hope the excerpts are genuine, because at least in the texts made public as of Monday, the Hillary Clinton that emerges is a knowledgeable, balanced political veteran with sound policy instincts and a mature sense of how to sustain a decent, stable democracy. With a level of   unimaginable in her opponent, Ms. Clinton described herself in one speech as “kind of far removed” from the ordinary American’s struggles because of her newfound wealth, and suggested she was making a conscious effort to compensate for that. In other talks, she said she “really admire[s]” even ideological opponents willing to run for office amid the toxicity of modern politics; she noted, correctly, that the optimal situation for the United States is “two sensible, moderate, pragmatic parties. ” She also favored the bipartisan   framework for deficit reduction, in which entitlement reform would be traded for progressive tax increases, and she offered an astute, historically informed discussion of the challenges of extending   coverage at an affordable cost. Her comments are playing as an embarrassment for various reasons  —   some valid, others not. She deserves criticism for withholding the speeches thus far, as well as for pursuing corporate speaking fees with unseemly abandon in the first place. And the speeches offer further proof that her   disavowal of the   Partnership trade agreement is an opportunistic trim, not an expression of her views. As for the   on both the Sandersian left and the Trumpian right about her reported aspiration for a “hemispheric common market” with “open trade and open borders,” however  —   it’s wrongheaded and hyped. Regional free trade is well advanced already, via existing agreements with Canada, Mexico and 10 other Latin American nations. And, in context, she’s clearly not advocating unregulated immigration. Did she call on Wall Street types to “help us figure . . . out” what went wrong in the Panic of 2008? Yes. Did she promise to privilege their views or interests? No, and she even warned them it was in their own interest to face greater accountability, given public distrust of finance. Then there’s her   view that “you need both a public and a private position,” which is playing as a confession of   but is actually a clumsy formulation of obvious truth: Nothing gets done in politics unless legislators can deliberate and negotiate candidly, outside the glare of publicity.  This whole episode illustrates that point. Ms. Clinton kept the speeches under wraps out of fear that they would be distorted for political purposes by her populist foes. Alas, that fear was amply justified in this populistic, polarized environment, as the manufactured uproar over their release proves. The fact that Ms. Clinton’s eminently reasonable and   words regarding the issues and her opponents are being treated as scandalous is the real scandal.   Read more:   Marc A.

Donald Trump’s retort was one of his better lines of the night: ”Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. Now that one, I haven’t . ..  Okay? Honest Abe.” It was such a good line, in fact, that the Republican presidential nominee was still using it Monday while campaigning in Pennsylvania. It was a good move on Trump’s part for two reasons. First, the story about Clinton’s paid speeches was buried underneath Trump’s lewd video on Friday afternoon, as I wrote Sunday. Second, Clinton’s defense . .. isn’t great. Here’s the exchange from the debate: MARTHA RADDATZ: This question involves WikiLeaks’ release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton’s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph) from Virginia asks, is it okay for politicians to be  ? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes. CLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ”Lincoln.” It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic. And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments; convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great    I thought a great display of presidential leadership. And here’s what was contained in the leaked email, which was from a Clinton staff member summarizing a 2013 Clinton speech to the National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade association that represents apartment owners, managers, developers and lenders (the campaign at the time was evaluating the possible damage that would come with releasing her Wall Street speeches) (emphasis added): *CLINTON SAYS YOU NEED TO HAVE A PRIVATE AND PUBLIC POSITION ON POLICY* *Clinton: “But If Everybody’s Watching, You Know, All Of The Back Room Discussions And The Deals, You Know, Then People Get A Little Nervous, To Say The Least. So, You Need Both A Public And A Private Position. ”* CLINTON: You just have to sort of figure out how to    getting back to that word, ”balance”    how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful, politically, and that’s not just a comment about today. That, I think, has probably been true for all of our history, and if you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and he called one of my favorite predecessors, Secretary Seward, who had been the governor and senator from New York, ran against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need your help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going at it. I mean, politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody’s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position. And finally, I think    I believe in   decision making. I want to know what the facts are. I mean, it’s like when you guys go into some kind of a deal, you know, are you going to do that development or not, are you going to do that renovation or not, you know, you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what’s going to work and what’s not going to work. As the movie ”Lincoln” showed, Abraham Lincoln did engage in the kind of backroom dealing that has become easy to attack in today’s political climate. In this case, Lincoln was doing it to secure passage of the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery. And Clinton’s speech clearly made reference to all of that before she made the comment about needing ”both a public and a private position.” Everything Clinton said at the debate about her speech was true. But it’s one thing to use that kind of gamesmanship to pass an amendment outlawing slavery; it’s another to use it when describing policies that affect big business. Clinton has already stood accused of being too cozy with Wall Street    a characterization she disputes    and she’s now   telling the business community that, in order to get things done, sometimes you need to have a public position and a private position. It’s easy to see why she invoked Lincoln in the private speech; it’s certainly not an argument she would want to make publicly about Wall Street issues if she wasn’t forced to. Also, while Lincoln certainly engaged in backroom dealing, his public position on whether slavery should be outlawed was clear and unmistakable. He used different methods of cajoling members to vote for the 13th Amendment, but it was clear what he was pushing for. If Clinton’s comment was more about using different tactics to get individual lawmakers on board, that’s one thing. But she suggested it’s sometimes best for politicians to obscure their true positions. That may be true, but it’s ripe for attack, given who was in the audience that day. And now that Trump is trying to climb out from underneath his video controversy, you can bet we’ll be hearing plenty more about it."

American moralism and   politics being what they are, her remark played as a confession of    —   though it was mightily and, from Clinton’s point of view, blessedly overshadowed by the awful    sexual transgression of Donald Trump. What really would be surprising, and pleasantly so, would be if the WikiLeaks raid on the Clinton campaign’s   led to a more mature, differentiated debate about the uses of publicity and privacy in democratic politics.      In the last month before Election Day, Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has faced questions about emails posted by the WikiLeaks organization. Here’s what you should know about them. (Sarah   Washington Post)   Transparency is the ultimate guarantor of democratic accountability. Like all good things, however, transparency can be taken to an extreme. Recent events  —   including the convoluted spectacle of a democracy’s presidential candidate’s internal communications being stolen and selectively publicized by a totally nontransparent organization of computer hackers, perhaps backed by a foreign dictatorship’s secret intelligence service  —   suggest that we may be reaching that point.  The same technology that enables all of us, politicians included, to communicate globally nearly instantaneously is also exposing everyone to   disclosure, also on a global scale, of pretty much anything they might do or say. “In this world today you should have no expectation of privacy,” former George W. Bush political adviser Karl Rove remarked recently, with chilling accuracy. This is a positive development with respect to wrongdoing, such as police brutality, that may no longer hide in the social shadows, because everyone with a cellphone  —   or, say, a video camera built into their eyeglasses  —   can be a documentary filmmaker. It is positive, too, in the sense that political chicanery and outright corruption may be more readily deterred.  To the extent that Clinton’s   quest for a zone of privacy has really been about securing protection for her husband’s philandering, or other questionable activity by herself and her associates, it is   and reprehensible, as her critics say. But one person’s corrupt bargain is another’s transactional politics. Much if not most of the internal Clinton campaign deliberations exposed by WikiLeaks were of the latter,     stripe. It was actually reassuring to learn that the campaign considered the view of skeptical “liberal economists,” instead of buckling to Bernie Sanders’s demand for a $15 minimum wage for   political gain. Insofar as Clinton’s 2013 speech was a plea for some space in which political leaders and their advisers could meet and discuss issues candidly among themselves, without grandstanding or fear of immediate leaks to the whole world, she was simply advocating a necessary exception to democracy’s   rule.  There was something refreshing about Clinton’s willingness to embrace and acknowledge the inevitable   tension  —   albeit off the record!  —   instead of pretending, hypocritically, that “the process” would work better in the full light of day.  Confidentiality is no guarantee of policymaking success, as her own disastrous attempt to hammer out a   bill in secret demonstrated in 1993. However,   Barack Obama’s 2008 promise to air his   reform drafting sessions “on  ” (a quaint,   promise in hindsight) was even sillier, as shown by his eventual resort to backroom dealings to get reform passed. We still don’t quite live in the panopticon world of “The Lives of Others,” the 2006 film about East German intellectuals under the brooding gaze of that country’s secret police  —   Edward Snowden’s warnings to the contrary notwithstanding.  The present danger to democratically necessary privacy is not so much “the surveillance state” as it is something even more bewildering: surveillance anarchy. We need to understand this challenge, and deal with it, if we are to reap the benefits of greater transparency while sustaining the basic interpersonal trust upon which democratic governance, like all decent social institutions, ultimately depends.  Hillary Clinton may not be the ideal spokeswoman for such an effort, for obvious reasons. It’s a valid effort just the same.

215989,"Hillary Clinton, Paul Ryan and the relationship that could shape Washington",Washington Post,Robert Costa,M,2016-10-12,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161013005231/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/two-wonks-one-question-could-hillary-clinton-and-paul-ryan-work-together/2016/10/12/f5bdb73a-8f06-11e6-9c52-0b10449e33c4_story.html,"It was October 1998, and Hillary Clinton’s midterm campaign swing for Democratic candidates brought the first lady on a Saturday afternoon to a   gymnasium in Janesville, Wis. A    conservative upstart from the town was running for Congress  —   and Clinton, rallying 1, 200 people with a   denunciation of Republicans, was trying to stop him. Clinton’s efforts failed, of course. Paul D. Ryan went on to win, and he has held his House seat in Wisconsin’s industrial southeastern corner for nearly two decades as he has risen to become the   Republican in the country. Clinton and Ryan did not know each other then, and they barely have a personal rapport now. When they served together on Capitol Hill, they did not collaborate. They have crossed paths only a few times, in perfunctory meetings while she was secretary of state. Clinton, 68, and Ryan, 47, also have no apparent social ties  —   although they do share a book agent, Washington   Robert Barnett. Nonetheless, their relationship could become Washington’s most important in determining whether the federal government functions over the next four years, should Clinton win the presidency and Ryan retain his majority  —   as polls show is probable, although not certain, for both. Ryan’s uneasy relationship with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump  —   one that appeared to reach its breaking point this week  —   has been front and center in this year’s melodrama of a campaign. It’s less clear what a   relationship would look like.         “It’s fine,” Ryan said flatly when asked about his relationship with Clinton at a   breakfast hosted by the Economic Club of Washington. “I’ve only had two or three conversations with her. . . . I can’t really say I know her very well. ” The relationship would hinge on how Clinton decides to begin her presidency. She could claim an electoral mandate and launch a pitched battle to pass the more progressive parts of her agenda. Or she could start with a relatively incremental push on a menu of domestic issues on which she and Ryan have shared interests, including infrastructure investment,   issues and   measures. “Do they want to begin it at loggerheads or with some signal to a very frustrated electorate that there is ground to be gained by focusing on the overlap between their two agendas?” asked William A. Galston, an official in President Bill Clinton’s administration and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Mixed views about partnership There is a glaring fault line between optimism and pessimism about Clinton and Ryan forging a productive partnership. Some see the pair as policy wonks with pragmatic instincts who are poised to break the logjam. Others say their political caution and entrenched ideologies would prevent them from defying their bases to resolve disputes and build agreements. “To assume Washington is going to work next year is to assume she’s not Clinton and he’s not Ryan,” said former House speaker Newt Gingrich ( .) who has been advising Trump and had made legislative pacts with Bill Clinton on issues such as welfare and spending. “Paul Ryan will not be dealing with Bill Clinton,” Gingrich said. “I had a guy I could talk to who had been the governor of Arkansas and dealt with that state’s legislature and helped to found a centrist organization,” he added, referring to the Democratic Leadership Council. “Hillary, on the other hand, is someone who is hard left. They are totally different people with different instincts. ” The other power broker in the   negotiations, Republican former Senate leader Trent Lott (Miss.) has a far different assessment.     Donald Trump started attacking members of his own party in a series of tweets Tuesday after many Republicans rescinded their support for the presidential nominee. The Fix’s Chris Cillizza weighs in on the unprecedented unraveling of the GOP. (Jayne   Washington Post)   Lott pointed to the lessons Hillary Clinton took away from watching her husband negotiate with Congress, as well as the warm relationships she built with Lott and other Republicans when she served in the Senate. He said Ryan has an even temperament and eagerness to shed his party’s reputation as obstructionist, as evidenced by the budget deal he struck with Sen. Patty Murray ( .) in late 2013. “Paul Ryan’s nature is to try and find a way to make things work,” Lott said. “And Hillary has seen how important communication is. She understands they’re not just a bunch of rogues up there. . . . You’ve got to be willing to give a little to get a little. That’s how Bill Clinton and I made deals across the board. ” Ryan’s biggest obstacle to partnering with Hillary Clinton would probably be the House Freedom Caucus, a group of dozens of   conservatives whose threats of rebellion led Ryan’s predecessor, John A. Boehner ( ) to resign and who have become a thorn in Ryan’s side. One member, Rep. Dave Brat ( .) who ousted   Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary two years ago, vowed to work with Clinton on issues such as fighting terrorism, but he said, “I don’t see a love fest. ” “For us, it’s not about Paul Ryan,” Brat said. “It’s about constraining anyone who’s opposed to stopping the expansion of the federal government. ” House Republican leaders have said that if Clinton is elected, they intend to continue their investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state, forecasting a stormy atmosphere. “Next year could be very much like 1998, when we impeached Bill Clinton,” Gingrich said. Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( .) who worked with Ryan on the House Budget Committee, said “the jury is still out” on the prospects for common ground. “The question for Paul Ryan is, is he going to be a speaker who wants to try and govern with President Clinton or continue to kowtow to the tea party faction?” Van Hollen said. “I think that battle within the Republican caucus is unavoidable. . . . If he wants to get stuff done, he’s going to have to be willing to have that showdown. ” On top of the possible tensions between the speaker and Clinton could be a Senate with a narrow majority, with Mitch McConnell ( .) or Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) as majority leader, depending on election results this fall. People who know Ryan said his amiable disposition can do only so much to help him connect with Clinton. “He’d be gracious and a gentleman, sure  —   less confrontational than Newt, and he’d be smoother than John Boehner,” said William J. Bennett, a close friend of Ryan’s and a former education secretary under President Ronald Reagan. But, Bennett said, “these aren’t people who are going out to dinner. ” Further complicating Ryan’s calculations could be his political ambitions  —   namely, whether Ryan, the GOP’s   nominee in 2012, would try to position himself to run against Clinton in 2020. Clinton probably would face similar pressures. She is distrusted by the Democratic Party’s liberal wing, which fueled the formidable primary challenge of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt. ). Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) and their followers have signaled they would try to halt any move to the middle by a President Clinton on bedrock programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which Ryan has long targeted for sweeping changes. Finding mutual goals? For Republicans, Clinton presents potentially a far different negotiating partner than President Obama. Obama came to office with little record of bipartisanship and with a disdain for the social rituals that have historically greased relations at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Clinton’s allies said she would be more sensitive to the political realities of divided government. “One of my favorite expressions about leadership is, ‘The best way to persuade is with your ears,’ and she truly understands that  —   the need to listen,” said Democratic former Senate leader Thomas A. Daschle (S. D.). Daschle led Senate Democrats through Clinton’s first four years in the chamber, and he recalled her painstakingly cultivating alliances across the aisle. For instance, she befriended Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) who only a few years earlier had argued the impeachment case against her husband. They traveled together overseas and worked on issues such as military benefits. And in 2006, when Clinton appeared in Time’s “100 Most Influential People” issue, it was Graham who penned a glowing tribute. “How do you build relationships?” Daschle asked. “It’s inclusion. It’s invitations to Camp David. It’s regular meetings at the White House. It’s socializing. It starts with that. ” In his failed attempts at a “grand bargain” with Boehner, Obama’s approach was to appeal to Boehner’s sense of reason and convince him that a deal was best for the country, even if he suffered a backlash on the far right. But Clinton’s associates said she would approach similar talks like a mechanic, understanding Ryan’s constraints and identifying areas of mutual advantage. One such area could be an infrastructure spending bill, which Clinton has said would be an immediate priority. Ryan, too, has in the past year privately reached out to top Democrats about beginning infrastructure talks, which the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and other pillars of the Republican establishment have championed. Clinton also would seek to work immediately on an overhaul of immigration law, an issue that Ryan has advocated but that has become anathema in parts of the Republican conference. It is possible that a Trump loss in November could shift political winds in the GOP, creating momentum for Ryan to consider starting discussions. “It’s got to be done in stages and pieces, not some big, massive bill that ends up collapsing under its own weight,” Ryan said at the Economic Club about the prospect of an immigration pact next year. There are other areas of mutual agreement, such as on criminal justice. Clinton and Ryan have expressed concern about mass incarceration and advocated changes to sentencing laws, and there are bipartisan efforts afoot. Another issue is fighting poverty, something Clinton and Ryan prioritize, although they have clear disagreements on the solutions. Ryan sees it as his personal mission and thrust it to the forefront of the GOP policy agenda. His confidants said he would feel invested in reaching an   accord with Clinton. Bob Woodson, a veteran community organizer who has mentored Ryan, said he could envision Clinton and Ryan touring beleaguered urban neighborhoods together. “Paul and I have taken many of these kinds of trips, and he does it in a way where politics isn’t part of it,” Woodson said. “It won’t be easy. She’s going to want more government; he’s going to want more choice in education and different ways of spending money to tackle these problems. But he’s the kind of person who could sit down and come up with five or six concrete steps where there is overlap. ” Clinton’s selection of Ken Salazar, a former Interior Department secretary and senator from Colorado, as   of her transition team was seen by some in Washington as a telling signal. “Ken was well known for his ability to work across the aisle,” Daschle said. “Just selecting Ken was a strong statement about her desire to govern. ” Ryan’s friends say a glimmer of hope may be the speaker’s aversion to the caustic animus toward the Clintons within his party’s ranks  —   a trait they say traces to his days as a staff member. The Midwesterner has never been comfortable about Clinton conspiracies or sordid accusations, despite his opposition to the Clintons’ policies. “He wasn’t like a lot of conservatives his age in the ’90s who wanted to dig up Clinton dirt and scandals,” said Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman who worked with a     Ryan at Empower America, a think tank that has since shuttered. “Rather than talk about Monica Lewinsky, he’d want to crusade against tax increases. ” Ryan’s unease about Clinton barbs has been evident on the campaign trail and in private fundraisers, where he goes after her policies but not after her personally. “He’s with his party, but he never said that he can’t work with her,” Weber said. “That’s a key distinction. He’s certainly not for her  —   but he has never said he’s unwilling to engage. ”  Read more:    Trump declares war on GOP, says ‘the shackles have been taken off’     Here’s how good a shot Democrats have of actually winning the House     ‘Donald Trump will protect you’: Some fear he is running to be a dictator"
216110,I read Hillary Clinton’s speeches to Goldman Sachs. Here’s what surprised me the most.,Washington Post,Daniel W. Drezner,M,2016-10-17,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161017235251/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/17/i-read-hillary-clintons-speeches-to-goldman-sachs-heres-what-surprised-me-the-most/,"As WikiLeaks continues to dump John Podesta’s emails onto the world, there’s a cornucopia of information to digest. I decided to start by focusing on a key source of tension between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary: the transcripts of Clinton’s paid speeches at Goldman Sachs. These were supposed to contain information damaging to Clinton’s campaign. After reading all three speeches   …     I don’t understand why Clinton didn’t make them public back in the spring. Okay, I understand a little. Clinton’s Goldman Sachs transcripts are not speeches per se but rather structured conversations between Clinton and a Goldman Sachs interlocutor, as well as a Q&A with the audience. Clinton references the same Winston Churchill joke a bit much. She praises Chinese President Xi Jinping on occasion, mostly for his political skills and his apparent ability to rein in the People’s Liberation Army. Mostly, however, what comes through is Clinton’s comfort talking about the subtleties of international relations. The contrast with the current GOP nominee is rather striking.  In particular, there are three aspects of the speeches that are worthy of note in 2016: 1. Clinton sounded more enthusiastic about trade in 2013. From the transcript of her first speech: But on the trade and regulatory harmonization, we are very serious about [the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership] and something that I strongly supported. The discussions are ongoing. It will come down, as it often does, to agriculture, particularly French agriculture, and we’ll just have to see how much we can get done by that process.  And there is no doubt that if we can make progress on the trade regulatory front it would be good for the Europeans. It would be good for us. And I would like to see us go as far as we possibly can with a real agreement, not a phony agreement. You know, the E. U. signs agreements all the time with nearly everybody, but they don’t change anything.  They just kind of sign them and see what comes of it. I think we have an opportunity to really actually save money in our respective regulatory schemes, increase trade not only between ourselves but also be more effective in helping to keep the world on a better track for a rural spaced global trading system by having us kind of set the standards for that, along with the [  Partnership] which we didn’t mention when we talked about Asia, which I think is also still proceeding. This isn’t terribly surprising, as Clinton’s position on trade policy has easily been the most cynical part of her campaign. But it is worth noting. 2. Clinton is keenly aware of the link between domestic dysfunction and foreign policy. Clinton relayed this anecdote from her first speech about the effect of Congress’s possible failure to lift the debt ceiling: I was in Hong Kong in the summer of 2011 and I had a preexisting program with a big business group there, and before we had a reception and there were about a hundred business leaders, many of them based in Hong Kong, some of them from mainland China, some of them from Singapore and elsewhere. They were lining up and saying to me: Is it true that the American Congress might default on America’s full faith and credit, their standing, that you won’t pay your bills? And you know I’m sitting there, I’m representing all of you.  I said: Oh, no. No. No. That’s just politics. We’ll work it through. And I’m sitting there: Oh, boy. I hope that is the case. So for all of their efforts to take advantage of whatever mistake we might make or whatever problem we might have, they know right now at least in 2013, the beginning of this century, the United States isn’t strong at home and abroad. They’ve got problems, and it is for me pretty simple.  If we don’t get our political house in order and demonstrate that we can start making decisions again  —   and that takes hard work. In all three speeches, Clinton talks about the necessity for political compromise in the American system of government. In this polarized climate, I guess I can see how such statements would be seen as politically problematic. No, wait, I can’t. 3. Clinton presaged the rise of Trump. In her third speech, Clinton refers to shifts in the political culture of the United States, and places them in the proper historical context: We have always had this kind of streak of whether it’s   or isolationism or, you know,   extremism. Whatever. We’ve had it forever from the beginning. So it’s important that people speak out and stand up against it, and especially people who are Republicans, who say, look, that’s not the party that I’m part of. I want to get back to having a   system that can have an adult conversation and a real debate about the future. A bit later, she elaborates further on the obstructionists in the GOP. See if this description sounds familiar: What I really resent most about the obstructionists is they have such a narrow view of America. They see America in a way that is no longer reflective of the reality of who we are. They’re against immigration for reasons that have to do with the past, not the future. They can’t figure out how to invest in the future, so they cut everything. You know, laying off, you know, young researchers, closing labs instead of saying, we’re better at this than anybody in the world, that’s where our money should go. They just have a   view of America. And they play on people’s fears, not on people’s hopes, and they have to be rejected. I don’t care what they call themselves. I don’t care where they’re from. They have to be rejected because they are fundamentally  . And every effort they make to undermine and obstruct the functioning of the government is meant to send a signal that we can’t do anything collectively. You know, that we aren’t a community, a nation that shares values. I mean, America was an invention. It was an intellectual invention, and we have done pretty well for all these years. And these people want to just undermine that very profound sense of who we are. And we can’t let them do that. After that passage, Clinton goes on to discuss Alexis de Tocqueville. The horror, the horror. These are transcripts, not videos, but my main takeaway is that Hillary Clinton is perfectly comfortable talking about both American foreign policy and the politics of American foreign policy. There is nothing in the way of bluff or bluster in these transcripts. Indeed, much like the original CableGate scandal (which Clinton talks about in the third speech) these transcripts mostly reveal a person who says similar things in private that she does in public.      The Post’s John Wagner breaks down some of the consequences of the release by WikiLeaks of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign. (Bastien   Washington Post)"
216115,"Always running, always prepared: Hillary Clinton as a high school politician",Washington Post,Dan Zak,M,2016-10-17,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161017235251/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hillary-clinton-high-school-years-always-running-always-prepared/2016/10/17/35dd9e4a-8c08-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html,"PARK RIDGE, Ill.  —   Hillary Rodham was 16 when she first ran for president.  It was February 1964, her junior year of high school in this town of steeples and lawns on the rail line to Chicago. She was vice president of her class, and one of five students running to lead the student council for the next academic year. Student rock bands played in support of candidates in the hallways and cafeteria of Maine East High School. “Stop mudslinging before it starts,” the school newspaper opined. “Keep this election clean!” No girl had ever held the job before. “The boys would run for president, and the most popular girl would run for secretary,” says classmate Tim Sheldon, who was one of Hillary’s rivals and is now a retired judge in Elgin, Ill. Years later, in her memoir, Hillary recalled a boy telling her she was “really stupid” if she thought a girl could win. But it was 1964, and she wasn’t even the only girl in the race. “It wasn’t acrimonious in any way,” says her female rival, Jackie Anderson Griesemer, who has fonder memories of the campaign and is now a retired speech and Bible teacher in Texas. “This was the ’60s before the ’60s got crazy. We just really enjoyed being together. It was a gentle time at Maine East. ” When Bill and Hillary Clinton emerged in the early 1990s as a national political force, they symbolized a generational shift. Photos of the future first couple from their university years  —   granny glasses, peacoats, shaggy hair  —   reinforced an image of the baby boomers ascending to power.  But the 1960s that formed Hillary Clinton were more “Happy Days” than “Easy Rider. ” It still felt like the 1950s, in some ways. She may have burned with an ambition that would soon be recognized as feminist, but her politics and upbringing were conservative. She cheered for Republican firebrand Barry Goldwater that year over Democrat Lyndon Johnson. Park Ridge was a world that hadn’t quite recognized how much it was changing, nor how much more lay ahead. It was still a place where no girl had been elected student council president  —   but it was becoming one where a girl knew that she could run.       Hillary Rodham in her 1965 senior class portrait. “She was the brightest person I ever knew,” said a classmate. (  Press)    Gas lamps still lined Main Street in the early 1960s. Elm trees arched above roads lined with old farmhouses,   residences and kit houses sold by Sears. Although they weren’t wealthy, the Rodhams lived in the   section of Park Ridge. Hillary had her own bedroom, with yellow walls, pink curtains, wood floors and a sun deck.  Her mother, Dorothy, was a homemaker and a closet liberal who taught Hillary never to run from a bully. Her father, Hugh, was a surly conservative who ran a small drapery manufacturing business  —   a rough guy who “swore, and said whatever came into his head,” recalls a neighbor, who first met Hillary when she was 7. He turned off the heat during winter nights to save money. Hillary took piano lessons in sixth grade from a neighbor who kept her taxidermied Pomeranians in a glass case. In eighth grade, she learned to square dance, became a lifeguard, played plenty of table tennis.  Her family lived four blocks from their church, First United Methodist, a   structure with stained glass. Dorothy taught Sunday school. Every night, Hillary and her younger brothers, Hughie and Tony, knelt by their beds to pray.   She and her friends didn’t meet Jewish peers until they started high school, in September 1961  —   the same month that a young associate pastor named Don Jones motored into town in his red Chevy convertible.  “The Park Ridge Methodism that she had was: Be nice, don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t say dirty words, don’t pierce your ears and don’t be contaminated by the world outside,” recalled Jones, who died in 2009, in a 1992 interview with The Washington Post. “Park Ridge was a typical homogeneous cocoon. ”  As youth program leader, Jones introduced his WASPy flock to the   poetry of E. E. Cummings, led a joint discussion of Picasso’s “Guernica” with a minority congregation downtown, and took Hillary and her friends to hear a talk by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Chicago Sunday Evening Club. “I’d not gone to school with any black kids, I’d not gone to church with any black kids,” Clinton said in a 1993 interview with The Post. Jones’s influence “was just   for me, and I just felt like there was this whole other world out there that was exciting and challenging that he linked to our faith. ” (Clinton’s presidential campaign declined to comment for this article.) During one youth meeting, Jones asked three teens to   a scenario of a daughter telling her parents that she was pregnant. “I was exposing them to a kind of literature and theology that said that human life is pretty bleak,” Jones said. “And it’s filled with tragedy and alienation  —   and that once we realize that, we have the possibility of human flourishing. ” Hillary viewed Christianity as a mandate to respond to social needs, according to Rosalie Bentzinger, who was then the church’s director of Christian education. “It was apparent from her youth that was she was going to be a person who cared about other people,” says Bentzinger, now 92 and living in Iowa, “and that she was an activist. ”     At the moment, though, Hillary was focused on student governance. At Maine East, where 82 percent of graduates were   she was elected every year to class council. She was part of the cultural values committee, which recommended that girls be allowed to wear culottes. In a school known as a crowded incubator of ambition and civic engagement, Hillary “was popular, she was intelligent, she was a good student,” recalls Tim Sheldon. “The girls really didn’t have sports to participate in, [so] girls like Hillary spent their time in extracurricular activities and working and studying. ” In 1964, in the second semester of their junior year, John Wayne and Sidney Poitier were   at the Pickwick Theater, a   walk from the Rodham home. Park Ridge had just passed an   law to combat increasing jet traffic from nearby O’Hare Airport. Local newspapers listed addresses for the city’s 13 fallout shelters. Young Goldwater supporters were meeting at the home of Hillary’s best friend, Betsy Johnson.     Hillary Rodham, front row on the left, as one of eleven seniors who were finalists in the National Merit Scholarship Program in 1964. “Girls like Hillary spent their time in extracurricular activities and working and studying,” said a classmate. (Maine Township School District)   And Hillary, aiming for the student council presidency, was eliminated on the first ballot. Jackie Anderson, the other female candidate, advanced to the next round, and Sheldon ultimately won. Hillary liked being in charge, so she was crestfallen. Briefly. “We were pretty upset,” says Ernest Ricketts, who met Hillary in kindergarten and is now a retired restaurateur in Oak Brook, Ill. “Hillary isn’t one to dwell on the negative. ‘Onward and upward,’ you know. ”  She got a second chance at victory toward the end of the semester. Hillary and classmate Howard Primer faced off as Goldwater and Lyndon B. Johnson, respectively, in a mock debate in front of the student body. The pair spent weeks preparing  —   scouring newspapers for dispatches from the outside world, gabbing about Vietnam and civil rights with other students at a rib joint named Booby’s, and organizing research at the Rodhams’ house. After the debate, the students voted. Hillary lacked the charisma to win the contest for student council president, Primer remembers, but she had the intellect to win a battle of ideas.  “She was the brightest person I ever knew, and I still believe that,” says Primer, now an entrepreneur in Charlotte. “The mood of the country was hostile to Barry Goldwater . . . but in our school Goldwater won big. So Hillary trounced me. ”  At semester’s end, Hillary put her hair in an updo for her first television appearance, on Channel 11’s talk show “Our 2 Cents Worth,” along with fellow members of the cultural values committee. The topic was polarization between cliques in high school  —   “greasers” vs. jocks and preppies  —   and how to foster mutual respect. That summer of ’64, Hillary helped write the student constitution for the new Maine South High School, where she and half her classmates would relocate for senior year. The committee wanted to choose “the rebels” as the school mascot, but administrators didn’t like the nonconformist connotation. The compromise was “the hawks. ”     When the class of ’65 started their final year of high school on Sept. 8, 1964, the gym and theater were still under construction at Maine South. The cafeteria didn’t have real silverware yet. For the first few weeks, 2, 500 students were continually getting lost in the new school’s sprawling maze of crowded corridors. By autumn, Park Ridge kids were washing cars to raise money for Goldwater. But for a classroom debate, a young teacher named Gerald Baker tasked Hillary  —   chairman of the school’s Republican organization  —   with arguing for Lyndon B. Johnson. Likewise, a classmate who was a fervent Democrat was assigned to defend Goldwater.   “We were both insulted and protested,” Hillary wrote later, “but Mr. Baker said this would force each of us to learn about issues from the other side. ” Later, Maine South hosted a schoolwide debate and mock election, in which the three issues were the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons and the expanding role of the federal government. Student teams argued each side at an assembly; Hillary was now back on her preferred Goldwater side. When 1, 280 paper ballots were counted, Goldwater won 55 percent of the vote.     A clipping from the Maine South High School newspaper captured Hillary Rodham as a young Republican debater, preparing to make the case for Barry Goldwater. (Maine Township School District)  Four days later, the vote in Maine Township was starker  —   58 percent for Goldwater, despite LBJ’s landslide in the rest of the country. “We had not evolved enough to oppose our parents in 1964,” recalls Howard Primer, Hillary’s previous debate foil.  After the election, Hillary won Maine South’s first “good citizen” award, sponsored by the Daughters of the American Revolution. “The pretty blonde was selected for her citizenship qualities of dependability, service, leadership and patriotism,” reported the Park Ridge Advocate. “She was always leagues ahead of me, at least in academics and focus,” says classmate Eileen Alonso Stratton, now an accountant in Oak Brook. “But I remember we were at a party one time, both of us, at somebody’s house. It was typical of a lot of the guys: They’re just acting up, or immature, whatever, and so she and I went in a laundry room and sat and talked. We both thought it was dumb, this party. ” In December Hillary became   of an   committee, which allotted $300 to scrub graffiti from the school’s northwest wall. “A student need not take part in the actual destruction to encourage it,” the    Hillary told the school paper at the time.   In the same edition, on the reverse side of the page, the paper printed a gag story that imagined a future Hillary  —   “a prosecuting attorney” with “a famous career”  —   being interviewed by Time magazine. “What was your ambition in high school?” Time asked. “To marry a senator,”   Hillary replied, “and settle down in Georgetown. ”     In her final semester of high school, Hillary narrated an   parody of “Hamlet,” titled “Halibut. ” She was named a National Merit Scholarship finalist. She performed in the school variety show “Americana,” a   spectacular tracing the history of the United States from the Pilgrims to the Twist. Off campus in Park Ridge, “Goldfinger” opened in Technicolor. A man from the John Birch Society spoke to a capacity crowd at the Rotary Club. The local newspapers wrote about local boys heading to Vietnam and returning with Purple Hearts.    “She’s one of us but she’s different,” with “a higher sense of service,” said a former classmate. (Courtesy of the Hillary Clinton campaign)  At the senior honors assembly before graduation, Hillary won a “goodwill” award for her friendliness. Multiple classmates recall that Hillary was also named “most likely to succeed. ” But the final school paper of the year was less kind. It imagined the class of ’65 in 10 years, and depicted Hillary as a nun named “Sister Frigidaire. ” In reality, Hillary would be a lawyer  —   and about to marry Bill Clinton  —   by her   reunion. For her   reunion, in 1995, she hosted her classmates at the White House.  Last summer, as her classmates gathered for their   reunion, she was a    grandmother running for president.  “Here we were with our friends from high school, and the common conversation is, ‘Have you retired, or are you soon going to be retiring?’ ” says classmate Joel Platt. “And she’s looking for a new job. It’s kind of an illustration of how she’s one of us but she’s different,” with “a higher sense of service. ” This year, a few dozen classmates campaigned for her in Iowa, where Ernest Ricketts, the Oak Brook restaurateur, told voters about the Hillary he has known for 60 years: “I don’t think she’s changed. ” In the Park Ridge of 2016, Main Street still has gas lamps. Hillary is one of a handful of notable alumni with their own modest plaques in the halls of Maine East and South. At the corner of Wisner and Elm streets, her childhood house is marked by a small, easily overlooked green placard on a lamppost: “Rodham Corner. ” Only one political yard sign is in the neighborhood, three blocks over, and it bears the name Trump. And on Oct. 25, the class of 2017 will continue the tradition of holding mock elections at Maine East and South, and once again Hillary will be running for president.      For almost twenty years, Hillary Rodham Clinton put her political aspirations on hold when she moved to Arkansas to marry Bill Clinton, who would become the country’s 42nd president. The former New York senator, secretary of state and Democratic nominee for president would be the first woman to hold the office if she is elected.

Bernie Sanders ( . ).  Why has Ms. Clinton, the “establishment” alternative facing the voters, wound up in the lead at this late date? According to much conventional wisdom, she is the beneficiary of structural factors, such as voter demographics, and of good fortune  —   in the form of the Republican Party’s spectacularly irresponsible choice of an incompetent nominee. No doubt a different GOP candidate might have run a stronger   race than Mr. Trump; anyone with a modicum of civility and political talent could have. Nevertheless, it is time to point out another reason Ms. Clinton is winning: She is earning it. She and her campaign have remained disciplined and   through tempests large and small  —   and through the tests of political communication and argument known as the presidential debates, both against Mr. Sanders and against Mr. Trump. It is not easy to stand on a stage for 90 minutes and parry words with an opponent, moderators and   invitees; still less is it easy to do so while keeping one’s cool amid sleazy provocations and unpredictable insults from Mr. Trump. Through it all, Ms. Clinton has stayed focused on issues, laying out a program for the country that we don’t accept in every particular but that is well within the broad mainstream of plausible policy alternatives. Perhaps most important, she has kept her rhetoric civil and inclusive, in the face of an opponent bent on trashing the norms of democratic discourse. This is no mere style point. It is in a way substantive too, because this election has taken on importance beyond the   stakes for national policy; it has turned into a trial of our democratic culture. Certainly, Ms. Clinton has found ways to needle her opponent. But by preparing for the debates, using them to advance rational arguments and refraining from responding in kind to Mr. Trump’s lowest blows, Ms. Clinton has exemplified what’s still good about that culture. In fact, you might say she has reminded people of what’s good about “establishment” politicians  —   about people who understand that it takes skill to survive and advance their causes in the public square, and who make it their business to polish those skills. In no sense do we suggest that her campaign is exemplary in all respects, or that she has answered all legitimate doubts about her record. Her failure to squarely answer moderator Chris Wallace’s questions about alleged conflicts of interest involving the Clinton Foundation, like her previous equivocations about her evasion of the State Department email system, continue to weigh on her campaign and may haunt her presidency if there is one.  However, we question the common assumption that any conventional Republican would be trouncing Ms. Clinton  —   especially because most of the Republicans usually cited were themselves trounced by the man now trailing the Democratic nominee. Ms. Clinton’s performance has apparently won her more appreciation from the electorate  —   a precious measure of political capital she will badly need if it does indeed fall to her to unite the country next year.

216224,This Khizr Khan ad for Hillary Clinton is incredibly powerful,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-10-21,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161022002031/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/21/this-khizr-khan-ad-for-hillary-clinton-is-incredibly-powerful/,"The story of Humayun Khan  —   and his parents  —   became common knowledge during the Democratic National Convention. Khan, a Muslim American soldier, was killed in Iraq in 2004 when he ran toward a suicide bomber, saving the lives of the men he was in charge of. Khizr Khan, the soldier’s father, told the story of his son’s life and sacrifice powerfully at the convention  —   while chiding Donald Trump for his comments about banning Muslims from entering the country. Trump attacked Khan as a Democratic shill, playing on grief to help elect Clinton. Khizr Khan is back. This ad, released by the Clinton campaign on Friday afternoon, features Khan telling his story again.         It shows Khan walking through his home, looking at his son’s medals and pictures. The   ad ends with a   of a   Khan saying this: “I want to ask Mr. Trump: Would my son have a place in your America?” It’s a remarkably powerful ad, connecting Trump’s rhetoric on Muslims to the real pain that such a pledge would inflict on Muslim Americans. Real people would be affected by all of these proposals, the ad reminds us. It’s not just words by Trump. The ad, according to the Clinton campaign, will rotate into swing states, including Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. I’m not sure that any ad fundamentally alters the trajectory of this race. TV commercials have become less relevant as the number of people watching traditional television live has declined. Plus, Clinton and Trump are totally known figures about whom very few people lack an opinion. But if there is an ad that breaks through the clutter while also reminding people of the stakes in the election, this might be the one."
216225,Is the media giving Hillary Clinton a pass for her own ‘Aleppo moment’?,Washington Post,Callum Borchers,M,2016-10-21,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161022002031/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/21/is-the-media-giving-hillary-clinton-a-pass-for-her-own-aleppo-moment/,"In the final presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said something that received little attention from the mainstream media: “Mosul is on the border of Syria. ” Whether that statement is correct depends on your definition of “on the border. ” Mosul, in northern Iraq, is roughly 75 miles from Syria. That’s not close enough for Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson, who thinks the media is ignoring a glaring error on par with his infamous “Aleppo moment”  —   that time during an interview when he appeared not only unfamiliar with Aleppo’s precise location but also unaware that it is the largest city in Syria and a center of that country’s refugee crisis. “There is a very hypocritical double standard here,” Johnson told U. S. News this week.  Green Party nominee Jill Stein agreed. “The political and media establishment have built up Clinton as the best and most experienced candidate on foreign policy,” Stein told the magazine. She added her belief that “this is much more troubling than Gary Johnson’s ’Aleppo moment,’ yet we expect the corporate media will largely ignore it because their owners don’t want to discredit the preferred candidate of Wall Street bankers and war profiteers. ” Context is important here. Debate moderator Chris Wallace had asked about the Iraqi military’s effort to force the Islamic State out of Mosul. If that mission succeeds, Wallace asked, would the candidates deploy U. S. troops “to make sure that ISIS doesn’t come back or isn’t replaced by something even worse?” Clinton said she “will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force” but stressed that the goal is for Iraqi forces to gain control of Mosul “and then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters. ” “What’s really important here is to understand all the interplay,” she added later. “Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria.   …     I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa. ” Clinton was making a strategic point. Mosul is a key city near Syria that Iraqi forces must retake before pushing farther north, across the border. It might have been a stretch for Clinton to say that Mosul is right on the border with Syria, but she clearly displayed a grasp of the region’s dynamics; Johnson, on the other hand, thought Aleppo was some sort of acronym. It is an even greater stretch for Johnson to equate Clinton’s mistake to his own  —   and to claim that the media ought to have treated them the same."
216254,Here’s what happens when Miley Cyrus door knocks for Hillary Clinton at a college dorm,Washington Post,Ian Shapira,M,2016-10-22,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161023002659/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/miley-cyrus-campaigns-for-hillary-clinton-at-george-mason-u-cue-the-frenzy/2016/10/22/cc6e929c-9865-11e6-bc79-af1cd3d2984b_story.html,"Miley Cyrus  —   the celebrity wrecking ball, twerking machine, chart topper, Instagrammer and former Bernie Sanders supporter  —   added a move to her repertoire Saturday:   for Hillary Clinton. “Hello? How are you? I’m Miley,” Cyrus said after knocking on the George Mason University dormitory room door of Jake Zartman, 18, a freshman from Ohio. The    pop star, now a coach on NBC’s singing competition “The Voice,” was dressed in a glittery red and silver dress with a blue furry jacket, a blue bow tie covering her chest and a pink headband. The young man was practically quaking. “I’m here supporting Hillary. Are you going to vote?” Cyrus asked. “You’ll be proud to know I’ve already voted for Hillary,” Zartman told her. “Yeah!” she yelped.   A crowd of excited George Mason University students waves to Miley Cyrus, who appeared at a dorm window as she campaigned for Hillary Clinton inside. (Jahi   Washington Post)  “Obviously,” Zartman said. And so it went Saturday afternoon at GMU in the swing state of Virginia, where a lucky number of students in the Piedmont Hall dorm stayed in their    rooms waiting for Cyrus to enter and chat them up, even pose for selfies on their junky twin beds. They were smiling and sticking their tongues out in trademark Cyrus style. Hundreds of GMU students not lucky enough to live in Piedmont had to wait outside, where they chanted: “We want Miley! We want Miley!” and sang her songs. She eventually blew them kisses from a dorm window, hoisting a “Stronger Together” Clinton campaign sign and prompting shouts below of: “Twerk for us! Twerk!” With less than three weeks until Election Day, the Clinton campaign has deployed Cyrus, Katy Perry and other celebrities in an attempt to boost turnout for the Democratic ticket. Cyrus’s endorsement of Clinton comes after some very public embraces of Sanders, the senator from Vermont who was Clinton’s top rival in the Democratic primaries. Just last month, Cyrus told Elle magazine that she was going to give “Voice” contestants the following advice: “Be Bernie Sanders. Be the person people want and love. Don’t worry about the masses. That’s how you make a memorable moment. Let people talk about it. ” And six months ago, she participated in a celebrity video pushing Sanders as the Democratic nominee over Clinton. In the April video, in which she appears alongside the likes of Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte, she said that Sanders “has been a bad ass in supporting the LGBT community. ” She advertised the clip on her Twitter account, saying, “I feel the bern @Bernie Sanders and  @SusanSarandon. ”   Miley Cyrus makes her way down a dorm hallway at George Mason University. (Jahi   Washington Post)  Regardless of whether she has been riding the Clinton train the whole time, one thing is clear: The musician is not a fan of Donald Trump. In early 2016, she launched into an Instagram tirade against the eventual Republican nominee, blasting him as a “    nightmare” and vowing to leave the country if he won the White House.  Although the sight of the provocateur knocking on doors for Clinton might seem more like a stunt, Cyrus, the daughter of country star Billy Ray Cyrus, has politics in her blood. Her paternal grandfather was Ronald Ray Cyrus, a Democratic member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, who was elected to 11 straight terms from the 1970s through the 1990s. She has also donated to multiple charities and participated in events to raise money for AIDS patients, natural disasters in Haiti and Japan, and organizations such as Habitat for Humanity. Cyrus also has history with Clinton, too. In 2013, she impersonated her on “Saturday Night Live. ” In the skit, Cyrus as Clinton walks into the Oval Office clad in a pantsuit and says: “What up, y’all? I’m like Hillary Clinton and I wanna be president one day to help, like, gay people, and black people and, like, Asians and little people . . . ” This being Cyrus, she, of course, then flashed open her blazer to show only a bra covering her breasts that had written in large font “2016. ” At GMU, one group of women welcomed Cyrus into a room decorated with a sign that read, “BABE CAVE. ” Katherine Quigley, 19, a sophomore, was among those eager to meet Cyrus. She waited by the peephole of her room’s door, nervously eyeballing the hall to see whether Cyrus would visit. “I’ve loved her since I was  —   what?  —   12 years old,” Quigley said. “She’s a role model. Oh, God, I peeked my head out. I shouldn’t have. People have been texting me all day about her coming, but I’ve been saying, ‘I can’t confirm anything.’ I have my shoes out, and random clothes. And there’s a random rope in our room. My roommate’s into camping, you know? And there’s a pizza box!” Suddenly, several knocks. “Holy moly! Miley Cyrus!” “How are you!” Cyrus asked. “How are you? I am so happy be here. ” The two fell into a conversation as if they were old friends. Cyrus said she felt like she lived in a bubble in Los Angeles, where she thinks most people are   and support women’s rights and liberal values, whereas when she visits home in Nashville, she feels the opposite. “What’s, like, your message to Mason students?” Quigley asked. “Um . . . vote, you know. Vote for Hillary,” she said. “I think honestly, I didn’t know how everyone was going to be today . . . It seems like everyone here is super awesome. ” “That’s such a Miley thing to say!” Quigley said, as she and her new friend laughed. “This is my first presidential election,” Quigley said. “Are you voting here?” “I am voting here. ” Cyrus approved and said if she weren’t filming “The Voice” on Election Day, she might come back to Virginia to personally check.

216267,How mega-donors helped raise $1 billion for Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Matea Gold,F,2016-10-24,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161024000307/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-mega-donors-helped-raise-1-billion-for-hillary-clinton/2016/10/22/a92a0ee2-9603-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html,"It was a few weeks before Hillary Clinton would announce her 2016 presidential bid, and she was already worried about money.  “Can we discuss the fundraising plans for first quarter?” her top aide Huma Abedin wrote to other senior staffers in March 2015, noting that Clinton was concerned. “Is the issue that she’s doing too much? Too little?” asked campaign manager Robby Mook. Abedin’s succinct reply: “JEB BUSH. ” At the time, donors to the former Florida governor were socking millions into a super PAC, pushing the limits of   rules. The stockpiling of   checks before Bush even declared his candidacy spurred a flurry of anxious conversations between Clinton and her staff, according to hacked emails posted by WikiLeaks. But the former secretary of state had her own financial weapon: a network of political backers that she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, had methodically cultivated over 40 years. Determined not to fall behind in the money race, Hillary Clinton ramped up her appeals to rich donors and shrugged off restrictions that President Obama had imposed on his fundraising team. Even as her advisers fretted about the perception that she was too cozy with wealthy interests, they agreed to let lobbyists bundle checks for her campaign, including those representing some foreign governments, the emails show. Top aides wooed major donors for super PACs, taking advantage of the leeway that campaigns have to legally collaborate with the groups on fundraising. The effort paid off. Together with the party and   super PACs, the Democratic nominee had amassed  $1. 14 billion to support her campaign by the end of September  —   on par with what Obama and his allies brought in for his 2012 reelection bid. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who did not begin fundraising in earnest until the end of May, had collected $712 million, including $56 million of his own money. Unlike Obama, Clinton fully embraced super PACs from the very beginning of her race, helping pull in larger checks from donors than the president did. An analysis by The Washington Post found that more than a fifth of the $1 billion donated to help her bid was given by just 100 wealthy individuals and labor unions  —   many with a long history of contributing to the Clintons. The analysis included contributions to her campaigns, joint fundraising committees, national parties, convention host committees and   super PACs.  The top five donors together contributed one out of every $17 for her 2016 run: hedge fund manager S. Donald Sussman ($20. 6 million); Chicago venture capitalist J. B. Pritzker and his wife, M. K. ($16. 7 million); Univision chairman Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl ($11. 9 million); hedge fund titan George Soros ($9. 9 million); and SlimFast founder S. Daniel Abraham ($9. 7 million). Since   campaign finance rules were put in place in the 1970s in the wake of the Watergate scandal, no president has ever been elected with the help of wealthy contributors who doled out such huge sums. The possibilities changed with the 2010 advent of super PACs, which can accept unlimited sums from individuals and corporations. “I would prefer if the limits were much smaller, but that’s the way it is,” Abraham, 92, said in an interview. He and his wife made 26 contributions to the Clintons’ campaigns between 1994 and 2008, which together totaled $461, 000, according to a database built by The Post. This year, he has given nearly 21 times that amount. Sussman, Clinton’s top backer, said his top priority is dismantling the   system that has flourished in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision. “It’s very odd to be giving millions when your objective is to actually get the money out of politics,” Sussman said. “I am a very strong supporter of publicly financed campaigns, and I think the only way to accomplish that is to get someone like Secretary Clinton, who is committed to cleaning up the unfortunate disaster created by the activist court in Citizens United. ” Clinton has emerged as both one of the sharpest critics and biggest beneficiaries of the new   landscape. On the campaign trail, she has repeatedly called for an overhaul of how elections are financed and vowed to overturn the Citizens United ruling, which allowed corporations to spend money on independent political activity. She has also pledged to sign an executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose political spending and to create a matching system for small donors in federal races. “More than 2. 6 million Americans have donated to this campaign because they know Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to bring us toward a more inclusive society with an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,” said spokesman Josh Schwerin. But Clinton would also enter the White House deeply indebted to a group of elite donors who have backed her and her husband for decades  —   helping raise $4 billion for their political and philanthropic causes over the years, according to an analysis by The Post.      An investigation by The Post last year found that the Clintons kept donors in their orbit for years by methodically wooing competing interest groups and balancing their liberal base with powerful business constituencies such as Wall Street and the tech sector. Top allies have financed not only their political causes, but their legal needs and their philanthropy. About half of the money they have raised  —   more than $2 billion  —   went to the Clinton Foundation, which has financed access to HIV treatments around the world, promoted early literacy programs and trained African farmers on improving their crop yields. The foundation’s fundraising has also generated controversy in this year’s campaign, as critics have seized upon its acceptance of money from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.      Seven countries, including three Persian Gulf states, donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. (Bastien   Washington Post)   Separately, donors gave $888 million to support Bill Clinton’s two presidential runs, Hillary Clinton’s two Senate campaigns and her 2008 presidential bid, according to campaignfinance records. As she ramped up her 2016 bid, Clinton’s advisers worried that her call for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United  —   a   policy goal  —   would not be enough to combat the view that she was closely aligned with wealthy interests. In a May 2015 discussion about possible campaign finance proposals Clinton could endorse, Dan Schwerin, director of speechwriting, wrote that he was concerned about “complaints of hypocrisy. ” “Policy alone won’t make the cognitive dissonance go away, in fact it might heighten it,” he added. “But having her make the unilateral disarmament argument directly and maybe even some straight talk that cuts to the core of people’s concerns about her relationship with donors in general, might help. ” At the same time, her campaign was contending with a new reality: The political world had changed since Clinton’s last run for office. Super PACs were now central players in campaigns. And many of her GOP rivals, including Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, were pushing the bounds of the use of such groups.  The Republicans’ aggressiveness  —   and the lack of response from regulators  —   alarmed Clinton. In early May 2015, she forwarded her advisers an article about the lack of enforcement by the polarized Federal Election Commission, which is charged with policing election rules. “What do you suggest we do?” she asked. “I have no magic solutions other than execution,” responded campaign chairman John Podesta, adding that the campaign needed to expand its network of fundraisers who bundle checks and “get Priorities functional,” a reference to Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC backing Clinton. “We should also ask BHO to do more in light of this, although they are kind of prissy about how they approach this,” he added, referring to Obama. Mook agreed: “I think we focus hard on raising as much as we can and then throw the kitchen sink at everyone who we believe steps over the line, understanding that has limited impact. ” The Clinton campaign has refused to confirm the authenticity of the emails posted by WikiLeaks, which were allegedly hacked from Podesta’s personal account. Government officials have already officially accused Russia of attempting to interfere in the U. S. election, including through a previous hack of the Democratic National Committee, and are investigating whether Russian intelligence services are behind the Podesta hack.  The emails show that Clinton decided to step up her own fundraising schedule that spring even if, as Adebin noted at one point, it made the schedule “a little crazy. ” And she decided to forgo some of the   limitations that Obama had put on his own fundraising. The campaign decided to not only let lobbyists bundle checks, but, after extensive internal debate, permitted some of those registered as representing foreign governments to raise money as well. Mook explained to other top advisers that the campaign’s outside attorney, Marc Elias, “made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don’t really get you anything . . . that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result,” he wrote. “He convinced me. So . . . in a complete   I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?” Communications director Jennifer Palmieri responded: “Take the money! !” Clinton and her aides also sent clear signals early on that they wanted supporters to back Priorities USA, which had originally formed to support Obama’s reelection despite his objections to super PACs. In an April 2015 memo, Elias laid out the ways that super PACs and the campaign could legally interact, noting that the campaign could share the names of prospective donors with Priorities  —   including how much they might be willing to give. Campaign officials could not explicitly tell the super PAC how much to ask for, he stressed. But they could say something like, “Donor A works in financial services and has been a   contributor. I think she’d be willing to do six figures for Priorities,” he wrote. Clinton also got a boost from another super PAC, Correct the Record, led by her ally David Brock, which coordinates directly with the campaign on opposition research, taking advantage of an exemption designed for bloggers.     To donors, the different groups were often presented as pieces of a unified enterprise. Four days before Clinton officially jumped in the race, retired banker Herb Sandler got an email from a Washington fundraiser working for Priorities USA Action who introduced himself as “the Finance Director for Hillary Clinton’s superpac,” according a message Sandler forwarded to Podesta. Two months later, Sandler gave Priorities $1 million. Podesta was recruited to pitch major donors to support both the campaign and Priorities as he traveled around the country, the emails show. After a trip to San Francisco in December 2015, Podesta reported back that Sandler was willing to give the maximum contribution to a joint fundraising committee between Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic Party. “He is also prepared to double down on his Priorities support as well,” Podesta added. “Thanks, John! !!!!” responded national finance director Dennis Cheng, punctuating his message with the hashtag “#ChairmanCash. ”  The emails show that Clinton’s aides were intensely focused on locking up the support of labor unions  —   a source of cash and ground troops  —   and often agonized over how to keep them on board amid competing political interests. In April 2015, after attending a gathering of major liberal donors, senior policy adviser Ann O’Leary noted that “a number of our friends”  —   including the Service Employees International Union  —   wanted Clinton to back organized labor’s “Fight for 15” campaign to raise the minimum wage. “Can we do something creative to support efforts without coming out for a number?” she asked. Two months later, Clinton garnered huge cheers when she called in to a convention of   workers, telling them “thank you for marching in the streets to get that living wage”  —   stopping short of endorsing a specific figure for the minimum wage. SEIU President Mary Kay Henry dashed off a note to Podesta with the subject line, “It worked!” “I looked around the stage and most fast food leaders had tears streaming down their face,” she wrote, adding that the sentiment in the room was, “She’s on our side. ” “Amazing,” responded Abedin when a staffer forwarded her the note. “Hope you shared with HRC!” SEIU officials said Henry’s email was referring to the support Clinton has shown for working families on a variety of issues, adding that members of the union have felt even more energized by her candidacy as the election has drawn closer.  In the fall of 2015, the SEIU endorsed Clinton, who has since expressed support for a $15 minimum wage. The union donated $1 million to Priorities and is spending tens of millions on an independent field effort to turn out voters in battleground states. Wealthy individuals supporting Clinton also frequently weighed in with requests and advice, the emails show. One regular correspondent was Saban, a dual   citizen who dispensed ideas about how to appeal to Latino and Jewish voters. After Trump described Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers in his speech announcing his run for president, Saban spurred the campaign to respond more forcefully. He urged Clinton aides to call Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) on the fact that he had super PAC backing, like Clinton. And he encouraged the former secretary of state “to differentiate herself from Obama on Israel. ” “It can easily be done   criticizing the President,” he wrote in June 2015, adding that she should “speak strongly against   and boycott, reaffirm the US commitment to Israel’s security +anything else your research tells you the Jewish community is sensitive to. “This is NOT a NY or California issue,,,,it is a Florida one,” he added. “Pls LMK how I can help here. ” The next year, when Clinton expanded her delegate lead over Sanders in the March 15 primaries, Saban sent Podesta, Mook and Abedin a jubilant message. “Cheryl and I are so very happy. ..... relieved. .... .. And looking forward to continued success,” he wrote. “Onward and forward. ” “Thank YOU for making it possible! !” Mook responded. “SHE is the one that made it happen with you guys and your teams by her side,” Saban replied. “Thank you for saying what you said about us but we’re just on the periphery. ”  Note: An earlier version of this story erroneously referred to the late wife of SlimFast founder S. Daniel Abraham. Abraham’s wife is alive."

And it will have been the votes of women who put her there. Think, for a moment, about what a remarkable milestone that would be. Consider what it would say about the long and difficult struggle to make the Constitution’s guarantees of freedom and equality encompass all Americans. The first 43 presidents were all members of a privileged minority group  —   white males. The 44th is a black man, and the 45th may well be a white woman. That is a very big deal. The historic nature of Clinton’s candidacy has been all but lost amid the clamorous sound and fury of the Donald Trump eruption. The campaign has seen many unforgettable moments, but one that I believe will prove truly indelible came during the third and final debate, when Clinton was speaking and Trump interrupted her by snarling, “Such a nasty woman. ”  Within minutes, “nasty woman” became an Internet meme  —   not so much because of what it said about Trump, since we already knew of his sexism and misogyny, but because of what it said about the moment. A “nasty woman” was on the verge of shattering the highest and most shatterproof glass ceiling of them all. That this accomplishment would come at Trump’s expense just made it a bit sweeter. Polls show Clinton leading Trump among women by   margins  —   an incredible 17 percentage points in a recent Fox News poll. If only men could vote, Trump would have a lead, albeit a shrinking one. But thanks to the 19th Amendment, Clinton is well ahead nationally and has taken solid leads in almost all the swing states.  Surely this has something to do with the “Access Hollywood” videotape in which Trump brags of groping and kissing women against their will  —   and the 11 women who have come forward to accuse him of doing just that. But I like to believe it also has much to do with Clinton and the virtues she has demonstrated during the campaign. Trump’s slide in the polls, you will recall, began after the first debate, before the “Access Hollywood” tape came to light. The contrast at that encounter, which took place at Hofstra University on Long Island, was striking. Trump was clearly winging it, relying on swagger and presence to bluff his way past questions he could not intelligibly answer. Clinton was sharp and aggressive, but also fully prepared to discuss the issues in detail. She had done her homework, and it showed. This was the case in the second and third debates as well, and I’ll bet her performances struck a chord among women who watched. To succeed, a woman can’t just be as good as her male counterparts. She has to be better. She has to know more, she has to work harder, she has to sweat the details while maintaining the illusion that she never perspires at all.  Like any woman who runs for office  —   or, for that matter, seeks a corner office in the business world  —   Clinton faces scrutiny in ways men never do. What was she wearing? Did she sound “shrill”  —   as opposed to “bold” or dynamic”  —   when she raised her voice? Did she smile enough? Did she smile too much? Male candidates simply are not critiqued in this manner, unless there is something bizarre about them that cannot be ignored (such as Trump’s hairstyle). The next woman nominated for president by one of our major parties will have a lighter burden because of the poise with which Clinton conducted herself and her campaign. President Obama’s election meant that African American parents were no longer lying when they told their children they could grow up to be president. Likewise, if Clinton wins on Nov. 8, all parents will be truthful when they tell their daughters that there is nothing they cannot achieve. It is ironic that when Bill and Hillary Clinton met, she was the rising academic and political star, largely on the basis of a 1969 Wellesley College graduation speech that received national attention. But she put her own ambitions on hold in favor of her husband’s. It was, at the time, a rational choice; he was likely to go further, and be able to achieve more, than any woman. Only decades later could she step out on her own.     For almost twenty years, Hillary Rodham Clinton put her political aspirations on hold when she moved to Arkansas to marry Bill Clinton, who would become the country’s 42nd president. The former New York senator, secretary of state and Democratic nominee for president would be the first woman to hold the office if she is elected.

216384,Republicans are already plotting the next war against Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Editorial Board,B,2016-10-27,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161028002703/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-are-already-plotting-the-next-war-against-hillary-clinton/2016/10/27/cb86bfc4-9c7c-11e6-b3c9-f662adaa0048_story.html,"ELECTION DAY is still more than a week away, but for some Republicans it is not too soon to begin plotting the next war against Hillary Clinton if she wins the presidency. Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) raised the prospect of an indefinite Republican blockade around the vacant Supreme Court seat. Irresponsibly, Senate Republicans have refused to even hold hearings on President Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the seat of Antonin Scalia, who died in February. Now Mr. Cruz seems to be suggesting that this willful dysfunction be carried into the new Congress and presidency. “There is certainly long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices,” he said. Mr. Cruz did not say he would oppose a nominee submitted by Ms. Clinton, which would be within the bounds of normal political discourse. Rather, he has suggested that Republicans in the Senate, if facing a Democratic president, simply not act. Crudely, his message is: We lost the presidency, so let’s take our marbles and go home. Such thinking seems to come easily to the senator who led the 2013 government shutdown. But it runs against the oath Mr. Cruz took as a senator to “well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office. ”  Another ominous statement came this week from Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who has led the investigation into Ms. Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Mr. Chaffetz told The Post’s David Weigel that he intends a   approach to investigating Ms. Clinton if she goes to the White House. “It’s a   environment,” he said. “Even before we get to Day One, we’ve got two years’ worth of material already lined up. She has four years of history at the State Department, and it ain’t good. ” In both the Cruz and Chaffetz statements rings the   tone of Donald Trump, who has not committed to respecting the will of the voters if he loses the presidency, who rails against “crooked Hillary” and whose rallies are filled with the ugly chant of “lock her up. ” It is a primitive approach to politics that suggests a conflict over ideas and policy is not enough, that the opposing side must be annihilated at any cost, even if it leaves the government paralyzed. Republicans who subscribe to   war should have learned by now this is not what the American people want. They are fed up with it. They saw during the Obama presidency the debilitating and fruitless result of a   Congress that voted more than 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, that devoted its energies to repeated investigations of the Benghazi   and that stalled funding for a   emergency, the Zika virus. We think that even in these days of polarization and anger, the voters want and should get a Congress and president that, after the election season, put their shoulders to the enormous problems the nation faces.     President Obama is expected to nominate Merrick Garland to serve on the Supreme Court. Here is what you need to know about Garland.

216402,Hillary Clinton’s campaign sounds pretty angry with the FBI right now,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-10-28,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161029002704/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/28/the-clinton-campaign-is-very-angry-with-the-fbi-right-now/,"This post has been updated with Hillary Clinton’s comments. Hillary Clinton’s campaign could have gone a few different ways with its response to the bombshell news that the FBI is looking into more emails related to its investigation of the Democratic nominee. It went with angry. The campaign’s   statement, from chairman John Podesta, is remarkable. It begins by    suggesting that this is at least partially a political response to Republicans’ continued   of how the FBI handled its investigation, along with FBI Director James B. Comey’s July conclusion that no ”reasonable prosecutor” would bring charges against Clinton. ”Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call,” Podesta said. ”In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly   the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.” Podesta then called on the FBI to offer more details about what exactly is happening with the emails, which sources have told The Washington Post are actually from an unrelated investigation into disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner ( . Y.) who has separated from his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Podesta also sounds furious that the FBI basically let people draw their own conclusions    and let Republicans mischaracterize the announcement    based on a   letter and didn’t provide more detail. ”Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is ’reopening’ an investigation, but Comey’s words do not match that characterization,” Podesta said. ”Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are, and the director himself notes they may not even be significant.” Podesta concludes: ”It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. The director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.”      FBI Director James Comey testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee July 7, about the recommendation that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted for her handling of government emails on a private server. (Reuters)   To be clear, the Clinton campaign has decided to fight this politically  —   not to play it off as some small thing and wait for more information. It is serving notice that Republicans won’t be the only ones applying political pressure to the FBI as it decides what to do over the next two weeks. Podesta’s first comments really drive that home. There is a reason the statement begins by pointing to the fact that this matter had been concluded before Republicans sought to keep   it. Podesta saying that Republicans are ”browbeating” career (i. e. nonpolitical) officials to ”revisit their conclusion” suggests strongly that he’s accused the FBI of reacting to that pressure  —   even if he doesn’t directly say that. Expect more of this combative tone in the days ahead.      Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke to reporters Oct. 28 in Des Moines about the FBI’s new inquiries into the private email server she used as secretary of state. (Photo: Melina   Washington Post; Video: The Washington Post)   Update: Clinton herself echoed Podesta’s call for more disclosure in a delivered statement Friday night    and also appeared somewhat exasperated by the lack of detail. ”We’ve heard these rumors, and we don’t know what to believe, and I’m sure there will be even more rumors. That’s why it is incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what they are talking about,” Clinton, said, drawing out her syllables for emphasis. ”Because right now, your guess is as good as mine, and I don’t think that’s good enough.” Clinton said these details should be released ”without any delay.”  ”Even Director Comey said that this information may not be significant,” she said, ”so let’s get it out.” Other Democrats offered similarly critical comments about the FBI. DNC Chair Donna Brazile called the announcement ”irresponsible.” ”Now, 11 days away from the election, [Comey] released a vague letter that immediately led to rampant speculation in the news media,” Brazile said. ”This would be an irresponsible action at any time and, unsurprisingly, Donald Trump and Republicans are rushing to politicize this episode without any of the facts. Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( .) meanwhile, called it ”appalling.” ”The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results,” Feinstein said. ”Today’s break from that tradition is appalling. ”              Caption   The Democratic presidential nominee hits the road as Election Day nears.

216403,The FBI’s October surprise just made Hillary Clinton’s awful week even worse,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,M,2016-10-28,2016.0,10.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161029002704/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/28/the-fbis-october-surprise-just-made-hillary-clintons-awful-week-even-worse/,"Between Obamacare’s rising premiums and the revelations of   by a top aide at the Clinton Foundation, this hasn’t been a good week for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. But the news  —   announced Friday afternoon  —   that the FBI would be again looking into the private email server Clinton used as secretary of state takes her bad week into truly terrible territory. Here’s what we know (and it’s, admittedly, not all that much): The FBI came across emails related to Clinton’s server as part of an “unrelated investigation,” according to a letter sent by Director James B. Comey to congressional leaders Friday. “I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,” Comey wrote. Here’s what we don’t: Is this simply   because of a handful of emails that were recently found? Or is this a   of the whole shebang? The answers to those two questions are, of course, critical. Information is decidedly limited right now. We do know that the new emails were found on a computer seized during the FBI’s sexting investigation of former congressman Anthony Weiner, on a computer used jointly by Weiner and his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. But Comey’s letter said the messages still had to be assessed to see whether they contained any classified information, or had any relevance to the Clinton email investigation.      Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke to reporters Oct. 28 in Des Moines about the FBI’s new inquiries into the private email server she used as secretary of state. (Photo: Melina   Washington Post; Video: The Washington Post)   There’s not yet any timeline for the process of ascertaining the depth, breadth and seriousness of the FBI’s decision to open an investigation about these new emails. It’s possible that we won’t know anything beyond Comey’s letter between now and Nov. 8. Or we might. We just don’t know. (Republicans are insisting that it must be serious because the FBI decided to do this so close to the election. Possible. But not close to proof of anything.) Here’s what you can be certain of: While some large amount of the email stuff surrounding Clinton is already baked into her poll numbers and unfavorable ratings, the swirl surrounding the new news from the FBI will not help the Democratic nominee as she tries to build momentum for Election Day. A few obvious issues it will create for Clinton: 1. Undecided voters  —   especially loosely affiliated Republicans  —   will be reminded of what they don’t like about Clinton, most notably the sense that it’s always something when it comes to her and her family. For at least the past year, a strong majority of Americans have said that the words “honest” and “trustworthy” don’t apply to Clinton. In September, more than 6 in 10 people in a Washington   News national poll said they didn’t approve of how Clinton had handled questions about her emails; that included 48 percent who disapproved “strongly” of her handling of questions about the email setup. A majority  —   56 percent  —   of respondents in a July   poll said they disapproved of Comey’s decision not to charge Clinton for her role in the email controversy. 2. The Democratic base will be less energetic. It’s been true since Clinton became the nominee that there is a chunk of Democratic voters who have been somewhat resignedly for her. They like her but don’t love her. (To be clear, this is not all of the Democratic base; a large number of Democrats passionately support Clinton.) They know that the other option is Donald Trump, and that idea makes them more excited about the prospect of turning out to vote for Clinton. But revelations like this one sap enthusiasm from a chunk of the party base. It reminds them of the reasons they either wanted Bernie Sanders as the nominee or weren’t ever sold on Clinton. 3. The Republican base will be energized. Trump hasn’t made it easy to be a Republican these days. From attacking Rep. Paul D. Ryan ( .) to ripping the Republican establishment as insufficiently loyal to him to the   women who have come forward alleging Trump sexually assaulted them, it’s been a rocky road for GOP base voters. Trump’s strongest card among these reliable Republican voters is that he’s running against Clinton, whom they hate. Their distaste for Clinton has been muffled somewhat by Trump’s antics. No more. Everything the GOP base doesn’t like (or trust) about the Clintons is on display in this FBI investigation. If they needed a reason to turn out and vote against her, they now have one. (Relatedly: Even a slight dip in Democratic base enthusiasm coupled with a slight uptick in GOP base enthusiasm makes the path to victory for   Republicans easier. “Unless the FBI closes this new investigation one way or the other next week, the likely impact will be to cut into Clinton’s margin, with the bigger effect being on   races than on the outcome of the presidential election,” notes Patrick Murray, who runs the Monmouth University Polling Institute.) How badly is Clinton hurt by all of this? It depends on what we learn and when we learn it. But there’s no way this is anything but bad news for Clinton with just 11 days left before Americans go to the polls. What an absolutely remarkable election.

216724,Hillary Clinton has to be gracious to Donald Trump. The rest of us don’t.,Washington Post,Paul Waldman,M,2016-11-08,2016.0,11.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161109000218/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/08/hillary-clinton-has-to-be-gracious-to-donald-trump-the-rest-of-us-dont/,"     If Hillary Clinton wins, at some point tonight she’ll deliver a victory in which she’ll speak the words “Donald Trump” or “my opponent,” quiet the brief eruption of boos, then read the words she and her aides have carefully crafted for that moment. She will be gracious and kind, congratulating him on running a spirited and improbable campaign, and asking for his help and the help of all his voters to move the country toward our shared goals of peace and prosperity.  Like the loser’s good wishes to the victor, this is an important part of the election night ritual, because it gives order to the process and reminds us that whatever venom might have passed between the two sides, it was all part of a rational system to which we share a commitment. If the winner was anything less than magnanimous, it would strike us as not just crass but a violation of the rules of the process. So Clinton will be kind to Trump, because at this stage it’s the right thing to do and because she has little choice. The rest of us have no such obligation.  No, what is required of us now and in the future is just the opposite. If Trump loses, we must ensure that his name and the presidential campaign he ran echo through American history as a dark and distressing tale, a case study in the power of hate, our vulnerability to demagoguery, and the limitations of democracy itself.  And as for the man himself? Every day he walks this earth he should be shunned and shamed.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump greeted voters in New York before casting his vote in the presidential election. (The Washington Post)   Some might protest that I’m being unkind. Can’t we leave Trump to his personal anguish and move on? Isn’t it enough that the man will have become the one thing he worked his whole life to avoid being: a loser? No, it is not enough, not nearly. Because if we allow it, time will soften our memories of who he was and what he did. And that will make us no less vulnerable to some future version of Trump who might actually win. So we have to keep reminding ourselves of how rancid his presidential campaign was, how it was an assault on everything we want politics and politicians to be, no matter our ideology.  Space precludes me from listing all of the despicable things Trump has said and done during this campaign; your own beliefs and priorities will dictate which one you found most appalling. Was it when he called immigrants rapists and criminals? When he got in a fight with a Gold Star family? When he encouraged his crowds to “knock the hell” out of protesters? When he said an ( ) judge in his fraud case couldn’t be objective because “He’s a Mexican”? When he used his Twitter account to pass on racist memes authored by white supremacists? When he said he’d order the U. S. military to commit war crimes? When he made up nicknames for his primary opponents like a    schoolyard bully? When he mocked a reporter’s disability? When he proposed a religious test for entering the United States? When he threatened to sue the dozen different women who had publicly accused him of groping them? When he told his supporters to go to “certain areas” in cities to harass   voters? When he used   tropes to warn of an international conspiracy of bankers plotting against him? When he promised to jail his opponent if he won?  Or maybe what most sickened you about Trump was his incessant and shameless lying, or the long list of scams he ran to separate struggling people from their money, or his repugnant misogyny, or his obsession with getting revenge on anyone who criticizes him, or his record of stiffing small businesspeople who did work for him, or the way every   and Klansman seems to have rallied to his cause, or simply, to sum it all up, the fact that he has displayed a positively epic combination of repellent personality traits without evidence of a single human virtue to be found.  Whatever matters most to you, the fact is that never has a presidential candidate worked so hard to win the ignominy in which Trump ought to spend the rest of his days. When this campaign started he was a buffoon, a joke, a character out of a satirical novel, a bizarre manifestation of every dysfunctional tendency in our politics and our media. But that was because we didn’t really know him, despite his having been a celebrity for three decades.  Now we do know him. Donald Trump must be understood, not only by us but also by our children and every subsequent generation, as one of the great villains of our age. He appealed directly to the worst people, and to the worst in people. He was an apostle of hatred, resentment, and fear. He told his supporters to nurture all the ugliness in their hearts, then put it proudly on display for all to see. He treated our democracy like it was one of the   toilets in the vulgar temples he builds as monuments to his own twisted ego. So we must give him what he so richly deserves. The name Trump should from this day forward be synonymous with everything we teach our children not to become, everything we argue against and condemn and despise, everything we want to eradicate in American public life. If we make that happen, then we will have begun to make up for the national shame we should feel for letting this malignant pustule of a human being get so close to becoming the most powerful person on earth. It may not be enough to redeem this awful campaign, but it’ll be a start.  "
216743,Donald Trump could actually take steps to try to jail Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Matt Zapotosky,M,2016-11-09,2016.0,11.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161110000454/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/11/09/donald-trump-could-actually-take-steps-to-try-to-jail-hillary-clinton/,"         Donald Trump said at a debate last month that he would appoint a special prosecutor to examine Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state and remarked that she would “be in jail” if he were president. In about two months, he’ll have the power to potentially make that a reality. He wouldn’t, of course, be able to snap his fingers and throw his political rival behind bars. He would have to order his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor, then count on that special prosecutor to agree with his assessment that Clinton’s email practices violated criminal laws about mishandling classified information. And even if he did all that and Clinton was charged, she would still be afforded a trial, and Trump’s special prosecutor would have to contend with evidence that led the original team of federal investigators to conclude there was not sufficient basis to believe a crime occurred.  Getting that process started, though, would not seem that difficult. Trump gets to pick and appoint the attorney general. FBI Director James B. Comey recommended in July that neither Clinton nor her aides be charged with any crimes in connection with her use of a private email server during her term at the State Department, saying “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring such a case. He said in recent weeks that his conclusion was unchanged, even after investigators examined a new, potentially relevant batch of emails discovered on a computer belonging to disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump rallies have sometimes been marked with chants of “lock her up,” and his supporters repeated those cries as the Republican moved toward an upset victory Tuesday night. Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, did not rule out appointing a special prosecutor in TV appearances Wednesday morning. “We didn’t discuss that last night and he did not discuss that with Hillary Clinton on the phone,” Conway said in one appearance.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has suggested jailing his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Here are some countries where the threat of prison is a political reality. (Bastien   Washington Post)   President Obama could   the affair entirely, pardoning Clinton before he leaves office in January. Legal analysts have said that could happen even though Clinton is not charged with any crimes. Such was the case with Richard Nixon, who was given a full pardon by Gerald R. Ford before he was indicted for all offenses he “committed or may have committed or taken part in” during his time in office. Even prominent conservatives in the legal field have said that for Trump to act to jail Clinton would be inadvisable, and it would politicize the Justice Department in an alarming way. Former attorney general Michael Mukasey, one of Clinton’s most vocal critics on the email issue, told The Washington Post last month, “It would be like a banana republic. ” Those remarks came after Trump broached the idea of a special prosecutor at a debate. “I didn’t think I’d say this, but I’m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception,” Trump said. “There has never been anything like it, and we’re going to have a special prosecutor. ” Later, when Clinton said, “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Trump replied, “Because you’d be in jail. ” Conway later said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Trump’s remark about jailing Clinton was a “quip. ” She added, “As for the special prosecutor, I think that’s Donald Trump channeling the frustration he hears from thousands of voters out on the stump every day. ” During his victory speech, Trump said, “It is time for us to come together as one united people” and said that Clinton had “worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. ” He made no mention of Clinton’s emails. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately return an email seeking comment. This post has been updated.

216825,Hillary Clinton blames one Comey letter for stopping momentum and the other for turning out Trump voters,Washington Post,Anne Gearan,F,2016-11-12,2016.0,11.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161113002516/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/12/hillary-clinton-blames-one-comey-letter-for-stopping-momentum-and-the-other-for-turning-out-trump-voters/,"Hillary Clinton blamed the renewed FBI inquiry into her State Department email system for blunting her momentum in the presidential election and the closure of that inquiry two days before Election Day for energizing voters for Donald Trump. “There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,” Clinton told top donors on a farewell conference call Saturday. “But our analysis is that [FBI Director James B.] Comey’s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum,” she said.  “We dropped, and we had to keep really pushing ahead to regain our advantage  —   which going into the last weekend, we had. We were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing. And we were feeling like we had put it back together,” she continued.      Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the letter from FBI Director James Comey announcing an inquiry into additional emails was ”pretty strange” and ”unprecedented” with days to go before Election Day. Clinton told supporters at a rally in Daytona Beach, Fla. that voters ”deserve to get full and complete facts.” (The Washington Post)   The surprise announcement of a revival of the shuttered FBI inquiry came at a time when the campaign was riding high, Clinton said. “After the third debate, we felt so good about where we were,” she said. Trump’s performance in the Oct. 19 debate was widely panned, especially his refusal to say that he would respect the outcome of the election if he lost. Democrats called him a sore loser. “We were up considerably in all but two of the battleground states where we were tied or one behind, according to our data,” Clinton said. “We were tied in Arizona. We just had a real wind at our back,” before the first, stunning letter from Comey. Clinton’s campaign insisted the reopened inquiry would turn up nothing, and many Democrats accused Comey of partisan motives. He was once a registered Republican. Comey has not commented publicly on either letter. His defenders have said there was no partisan intent and that he should not be blamed for Clinton’s loss to an opponent who ultimately had a deeper well of support among voters. Clinton did not accuse Comey of partisanship Saturday. But she did say that what should have been good news essentially backfired. Comey issued another letter to Congress on the Sunday before Election Day, concluding that the   examination of newly discovered emails had turned up nothing to change his earlier conclusion that there had been no criminal conduct. “Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would  —   saying there was no there there  —   was a real motivator for Trump’s voters,” Clinton said. A day earlier, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri had told the same group of donors something similar  —   that the news angered Trump voters and caused a spike in turnout, while Clinton’s projected turnout fell. “Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,” Clinton said.  The Democrat focused on the outside events she said affected her campaign in the last three weeks of the election. She said nothing about other, larger forces at work  —   Trump’s message of change in a restive time, his pledge to represent the aggrieved working class, the difficulty of any political party winning a third consecutive presidential term, her own limited attention to economic anxiety or the sexism and discomfort that surrounded her attempt to become the first female president.

217106,Trump is right not to go after Hillary Clinton. But it’s not his decision to make.,Washington Post,Editorial Board,B,2016-11-22,2016.0,11.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161123000918/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-right-not-to-go-after-hillary-clinton-but-its-not-his-decision-to-make/2016/11/22/65338f36-b0e0-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html," THE NATION ought to be relieved that   Donald Trump has decided not to press his campaign pledge to criminally investigate rival Hillary Clinton for her handling of email while secretary of state and for the activities of the Clinton Foundation. A   probe, fueled by Mr. Trump from the White House, would invariably become a political circus, take on the overtones of vendetta and deepen the wounds of the election. It would represent a continuation of the reckless “lock her up” chants by Mr. Trump’s campaign crowds, a mantra that suggested a Trump administration would run roughshod over the rule of law.  It would also fly in the face of the conclusion already drawn by FBI Director James B. Comey after a thorough investigation of Ms. Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Mr. Comey said that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against Ms. Clinton based on the available evidence.  With the presidential campaign ended, Mr. Trump seems to have concluded that the legal pursuit of Ms. Clinton or former president Bill Clinton would be a legal and political loser. “It would be very, very divisive for the country,” he told the New York Times on Tuesday. “My inclination,” he said, “would be, for whatever power I have on the matter, is to say let’s go forward. This has been looked at for so long, ad nauseam. ”  But even in his welcome rethinking, it was not clear that Mr. Trump understands the principle of justice insulated from political control. His statement contained only a glimmer of recognition that, as president, it should not be for him to decide whether criminal prosecutions are undertaken. The law enforcement system and the U. S. attorneys who investigate and prosecute federal crimes are supposed to be independent, free from interference by the White House or anyone else. The president’s role is to appoint an attorney general and set broad political priorities. In the case of Ms. Clinton’s emails, Mr. Comey has already made a determination; Mr. Trump’s statement suggested he will not, improperly, seek to reverse it once in office. Separately, there may be ongoing investigations into the Clinton Foundation. If so, they should be left to the professionals at the FBI and career prosecutors at the Justice Department.  In his career as a brassy and pugilistic tycoon, Mr. Trump often gave the impression he saw the law as just another tool for advancing his personal interests or retaliating against his foes. Once he sits in the Oval Office, he must behave  —   and think  —   differently. His apparent decision not to pursue Ms. Clinton is a step in the right direction. But given his past behavior and campaign statements, it remains incumbent on Mr. Trump to show that he fully accepts the U. S. constitutional mandate of impartial justice and a political system ruled by law.    Read more:   Charles Krauthammer: It’s not the ‘locker room’ talk. It’s the ‘lock her up’ talk.   Marc A.

217229,Donald Trump’s bogus claim that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton,Washington Post,Glenn Kessler,M,2016-11-27,2016.0,11.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161128003044/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/27/trumps-bogus-claim-that-millions-of-people-voted-illegally-for-hillary-clinton/,"“In addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. ”  —     Donald Trump, in a tweet, Nov. 27 Angered by demands for a recount in the three states that gave him an electoral college victory,   Donald Trump made a bold but unsubstantiated assertion in a tweet  —   that “millions of people” voted illegally in the presidential election. He suggested they voted for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who now leads in the popular vote by 2. 2 million votes, and thus he actually also won the popular vote.   In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016   Winning the electoral college is all that counts in the presidential race. But losing the popular vote by such a substantial margin apparently gnaws at Trump. Is there any basis for his claim? The Facts The simple answer is no. This is a bogus claim with no documented proof. Our colleagues at Snopes. com and PundiFact have already examined this claim, back when it was hot in the   blogosphere, not a statement made by a future U. S. president. The whole thing started with a few tweets by Gregg Phillips, a   conservative voter fraud specialist.   Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations.  Number of   votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team.  —   Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 11, 2016     We have verified more than three million votes cast by  .  We are joining . @TrueTheVote to initiate legal action. #unrigged  —   Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 13, 2016   These claims were then picked up by such purveyors of false facts as Infowars. com, a   website that, among other things, claims that no one actually died in a massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. One article described Phillips as being affiliated with VoterFraud. org but in reality he says he is the founder of VoteStand. com, supposedly an app that detects vote fraud. Phillips also has claimed that Obamacare is the “biggest voter registration fraud scheme in the history of the world” because it provided opportunities for voter registration. In any case, Phillips made this claim  —   and then has declined to provide any evidence to back it up, even though reporters have asked:   @tynanwrites @TrueTheVote  No. We will release it in open form to the American people. We won’t allow the media to spin this first. Sorry.  —   Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 15, 2016   “He said he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy,” PundiFact reported. “Phillips would also not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. ” It’s certainly rather odd that Phillips would make such a claim before he had verified whether it was true. He did not respond to a query from The Fact Checker after Trump tweeted, although he gleefully celebrated anger at his claim.   Bots and trolls are pissed today. #bothurt https:  .   —   Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 27, 2016   Back when Trump was trailing in the polls and was threatening to dispute the election results because the system was “rigged,” we’ve previously given Trump four Pinocchios for making a number of bogus claims about alleged voter fraud. Among other things, he falsely asserted that illegal immigrants were tipping the results in elections, based on a misinterpretation of disputed data. Even the researcher who produced the data said Trump was taking his findings out of context: “Our results suggest that almost all elections in the U. S. are not determined by   participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions. ” A representative of the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for evidence of Trump’s claim. It’s worth noting that, unlike Trump, Phillips says he does not assume that all of the alleged illegal votes were cast for Clinton.   @caleblehman15 By the way, we have never said they all voted for Hillary. Why lie?  —   Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 16, 2016   The Pinocchio Test Simply put, there is no evidence that “millions of people” voted illegally in the election. Now that Trump is on the verge of becoming president, he needs to be more careful about making wild allegations with little basis in fact, especially if the claim emerged from a handful of tweets and   websites.

217328,Hillary Clinton wasn’t charged with mishandling classified information. Trump might appoint someone convicted of it.,Washington Post,Matt Zapotosky,M,2016-12-01,2016.0,12.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hillary-clinton-wasnt-charged-with-mishandling-classified-information-trump-might-appoint-someone-convicted-of-it/2016/12/01/9f44f04c-b726-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html,"Donald Trump, on the campaign trail, would occasionally compare the criminal investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information with the case of former CIA director David Petraeus. In Trump’s view, Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information, was pursued unfairly, while Clinton deserved to be treated more harshly. “The system is rigged,” Trump tweeted after the FBI recommended that Clinton not be charged. “General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment. ” That assessment has long irked Clinton supporters and even the FBI  —   which feels that Petraeus’s case was a   example of criminal wrongdoing with aggravating factors, while Clinton’s was not. Now, Petraeus is under consideration for a job in Trump’s administration  —   possibly even as secretary of state, the job Clinton used to hold. Petraeus and Trump met this week, and Trump wrote on Twitter that he was “very impressed!”      Retired Army general David Petraeus has emerged as a potential pick for secretary of state in the upcoming administration of   Donald Trump. (Bastien Inzaurralde, Osman   Washington Post)   If nominated to be secretary of state, Petraeus would have to undergo a potentially bruising confirmation hearing that would probably reexamine the lurid case that led to his conviction and dredge up old comparisons to Clinton. His and Clinton’s cases both involve investigations of mishandling of classified information, but under dramatically different circumstances. Petraeus pleaded guilty last year to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information, admitting that he gave sensitive materials to his former lover and biographer, Paula Broadwell. He was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $100, 000. His probation includes several restrictions that could complicate his holding a Cabinet position  —   for instance, he must have   travel approved by the U. S. Probation Office, and he must submit to warrantless searches by his probation officer at any time. Petraeus’s probation expires in April 2017, and Trump, upon taking office, could commute his sentence. Jeffrey H. Smith, an attorney for Petraeus, said that his client has made frequent international trips in the past 19 months, and all have been approved by the probation office. Smith said it would be “premature and wrong, in my judgment  —   simply because he admitted to this one mistake and was convicted of a federal misdemeanor  —   that he cannot serve as secretary of state. ” “From his point of view, he admitted his mistake, he’s paid the price, and the Senate and the country ought to view him in that regard,” Smith said. “He stood up and took his medicine, and given everything he’s done for the country, and given the potential that he could be secretary of state and what he could bring to the table, he wants all that to be considered as a whole. ”  Those involved in the Petraeus case at one point contemplated much more serious charges of lying to the FBI and violating a section of the Espionage Act. Officials have said the information contained in the eight notebooks Petraeus gave to Broadwell could have caused grave damage to national security, if disclosed. The information included war strategies and the identities of covert officers, the officials said. Petraeus also told agents that he had not provided classified information to Broadwell or facilitated her obtaining it, which FBI Director James B. Comey said was a lie. Smith said Petraeus realized soon after he gave the journals to Broadwell “that was a mistake,” and he asked for them back. He said Broadwell had agreed that she would not use classified material in her book, and none was included. Smith also disputed that Petraeus intentionally misled investigators, saying that Petraeus “had forgotten about the journals” when the FBI asked him whether he gave Broadwell classified information. At a congressional hearing this year, Comey asserted forcefully that the Petraeus case was worthy of prosecution, while the Clinton case was not. He said the Petraeus case “illustrates importantly the distinction” with the Clinton matter. “So the question is, do you agree with the claim that General Petraeus, and I quote, ‘got in trouble for far less,’ end of quote? Do you agree with that statement?” Rep. Elijah E. Cummings ( .) asked the FBI director. “No, it’s the reverse,” Comey said. “And what do you mean by that?” Cummings said. “His conduct, to me, illustrates the categories of behavior that mark the prosecutions that are actually brought. Clearly intentional conduct. Knew what he was doing was a violation of the law. Huge amounts of information that  —   even if you couldn’t prove he knew it  —   it raises the inference that he did it. An effort to obstruct justice. That combination of things makes it worthy of a prosecution, a misdemeanor prosecution, but a prosecution nonetheless. ”  Smith declined to comment on the direct comparison of Petraeus’s case and Clinton’s. FBI agents investigated Clinton to determine whether classified information was mishandled because of her use of a private server while she was secretary of state. Comey said Clinton and her staffers were “extremely careless” in how they handled sensitive material, and there was “evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information. ” But Comey said that “no reasonable prosecutor” would actually bring a case against her. Classified material did traverse Clinton’s private server. Information in 110 emails contained information sensitive enough to be classified at the time it was sent or received, and eight email chains included information properly classified as “top secret,” the highest level of classification, Comey said. But Comey said agents could find no substantive evidence that Clinton intended to mishandle classified information, that she lied during her interview with agents, or that she made any efforts to obstruct justice. Clinton has said using the private server was a mistake and one she wishes she had not made. Comey did not fully clear Clinton of wrongdoing. Were an FBI employee to do what she did, Comey said, the employee might face professional consequences, such as a loss of a security clearance, suspension or even termination. But he said he did not feel she should be charged with a crime. Petraeus  —   a retired Army general and former CIA director who left the agency amid revelations about his relationship with Broadwell  —   would need a security clearance to serve as secretary of state. The CIA suspended his security clearance after his conviction and it remains suspended, U. S. officials said. A CIA spokesman declined to comment. Smith said that Petraeus does not hold a security clearance. A criminal conviction would not automatically preclude Petraeus from obtaining a clearance. He would have to pass a background check that assesses his “strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and a willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information,” according to information on the State Department’s website. Whether to grant a clearance is a “discretionary security decision based on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative personnel,” according to the site. A State Department official said the department would “not speculate on prospects for that process. ” This story has been updated with comments from Petraeus’s lawyer.  Greg Miller contributed to this report.   For a video, go to wapo. ."
217346,A photo of a 4-year-old with Hillary Clinton was used as a disgusting meme. Her mom fought back.,Washington Post,Colby Itkowitz,F,2016-12-01,2016.0,12.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/12/01/a-photo-of-a-4-year-old-with-hillary-clinton-was-used-as-a-disgusting-meme-her-mom-fought-back/,"Early in the campaign, a    girl dressed as Hillary Clinton for Halloween, wearing a blazer and carrying a briefcase, met her idol. The candidate, then vying for the Democratic nomination, posed for a picture with her   after an event in the girl’s home town of Charleston, S. C. in 2015. Clinton told her she looked like a future president. Jennifer Jones’s daughter, Sullivan, cherished the picture, now framed in her bedroom, showing a smiling Clinton crouching behind her with both hands on her little shoulders.    Hillary Clinton poses with    Sullivan at the event in Charleston, S. C. (Courtesy of Jennifer Jones via Hillary for America)  But more than a year later  —   the day after Clinton lost the election and as Jones was processing her own grief over the loss  —   their treasured photo was turned into something sinister. Someone had taken the photo, originally uploaded to the Clinton campaign Flickr page, and turned it into a meme that was then shared thousands of times across social media. Bold white type across the top of the image read, “I AM FOR WOMEN’S RIGHTS!” Then halfway down, text covering the lower half of Sullivan’s body accused Clinton of accepting money and refugees from countries “that would mutilate this girl’s genitals, marry her to a Muslim pedophile, and stone her to death if she doesn’t wear a bedsheet. ” Jones hadn’t been on social media. So she didn’t see that a friend had shared the image to her Facebook page asking if she’d seen it. Another friend took a screenshot of it and sent it to her in a text message. For    Jones, who works the overnight shift at a local hotel so she can be at home during the day for her two daughters, it felt like a personal failing. That night, after she gave Sullivan a bath and put her to bed, she searched for the photo online and found thousands of blogs and feeds on Instagram and Pinterest and Facebook that shared the image. She believed what she’d always been told: Once something is on the Internet, it’s there forever. “I felt like I failed her,” Jones said. “As a mother, your job is to protect and fix things, and I wasn’t able to fix it. I’ve never felt so low in my life with this image being out there that I had no control over. ” She traced one photo to a Facebook page, “Men for Donald Trump,” which has more than 200, 000 followers. She implored them to take it down. At first they resisted, but after dozens of her friends bombarded them with messages, they obliged. It was a victory, but a small one. That was only one site. There were countless more. Was it even possible to go to each one and make the same request? She reported hundreds to social media sites and Google, but that wasn’t going to purge the image of her little girl from the Internet. She makes $10 an hour at her hotel job. She couldn’t afford to hire an attorney. Several days later, she posted about it on Pantsuit Nation, the Facebook group of more than 3 million that started as a secret   page and has morphed into a massive online community where people share stories and seek support. Jones asked if they could help her report the image   . Soon messages poured into her inbox offering help. This person knew someone at Pinterest who could help; another had a contact at the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Then she got a message from Shaun Kozolchyk, the San Francisco director of development for the   League. “I am a mother of my own two daughters. I was so horrified and deeply affected by that post and knew the work we do at ADL could be a space that could be helpful,” Kozolchyk said. She contacted a colleague who works on   response issues, who immediately verified that the Clinton campaign held the copyright to that photo. Any unauthorized use of it was against the law. The ADL sent a   notice to the originating sites and, soon after, it disappeared from the Internet. “When I got all this response from all these people from all over the country, it’s going to sound cheesy, but it felt like this giant blue blanket of love wrapped over me, and I didn’t feel alone anymore,” Jones said. “There were so many people, who said, ‘we got you. ’” But what happened next gives Jones reason to believe her fight had a wider cause. When she shared again on Pantsuit Nation what the ADL had been able to do, others started coming forward saying their child’s image had been used in a meme. They just didn’t think there was anything they could do about it. Kozolchyk said the ADL is now working on about a dozen similar cases to get these memes removed. “Every day I come into work and we are bombarded with cases of hate and bigotry. You start to feel deflated and hopeless, but you have to keep pushing,” Kozolchyk said. “Then you get this kind of victory, and it carries you through to the next thing. ” Read more Inspired Life: ‘It’s unprecedented in our history’: Trump’s election inspired millions in nonprofit donations ‘You Belong.

217508,How Paul Ryan’s attacks on Hillary Clinton could come back to haunt him,Washington Post,Amber Phillips,F,2016-12-07,2016.0,12.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/07/how-paul-ryans-attacks-on-hillary-clinton-could-come-back-to-haunt-him/,"    During the presidential campaign, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) was one of the most passionate and eloquent defenders of House Republicans’ multipronged investigations of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s actions as secretary of state. When some accused Republicans of clamoring for investigations of Clinton’s emails and family foundation just to undermine her campaign, Ryan reframed the inquiries as a matter of principle: “I think it goes without saying we should treat people fairly. No one should be above the rules, no one should be above the law, and that’s what we’re looking for, equality,” Ryan told CNN’s Jake Tapper in a July interview. “So that people should be held to the same set of standards. That’s the problem with Washington, is people think there’s   and they think that everybody is being held to different standards. And the problem is that that’s true!”    Now that Donald Trump won, those words could come back to haunt Ryan. With each passing day, Trump is tangling himself in a knot of potential business and family conflicts of interest while he runs the country. That means Republicans in Congress could soon find the tables turned: Democrats clamoring for ethics investigations of the president. And what’s more, they’d be able to point to Ryan’s own argument  —   that no one should be above the law  —   to make their case.         It probably won’t surprise you to hear that Ryan is not nearly as bullish on investigating Trump as he was Clinton. He has been repeatedly asked over the past week or two how he feels about Trump’s potential for conflicts of interest, and his answer has boiled down to: It’s not my problem. “How do you want him to address his business conflicts?” CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Ryan in an interview Wednesday. Ryan responded: “However he wants to. You know, this is not what I’m concerned about in Congress. ” When pressed on it again, Ryan said: “I have every bit of confidence he’s going to get himself right with moving from being the business guy that he is to the president he’s going to become. I’m focused on getting this agenda passed so that we can turn around and tackle this country’s big problems before they tackle us. That is what I’m focused on. And not the legal details of how he divorces himself from his business, which I know he will. ” In other words: As long as Trump is signing my tax reform and Obamacare repeal bills into law, and there’s no legally verified conflicts of interest, no problem.  To some degree, that’s politics: You hit the opposition when you can, and you duck when they’re hitting you, even if it’s for arguably the same thing. The problem for Ryan is that Trump is giving no indication that he plans to divorce himself from his business at all, at least not in a way that most government ethics experts think is sufficient to prevent a situation in which Trump could make a decision based on his checkbook. And that means accusations of Trump’s conflicts of interest probably won’t be going away. Presidents have had conflicts of interest before, of course. But most of them have put their assets in a blind trust (i. e. NOT in the hands of their family members) to avoid it. As to how this compares with Clinton, those same government watchdog experts questioning Trump’s family business setup were also asking questions about how Clinton as president would separate herself from her family’s Clinton Foundation. But the Clinton Foundation is a nonprofit. Trump’s business is very much for profit, and it very much affects his personal wealth. And that underscores the dilemma Trump could be backing himself (and Hill Republicans) into: We’ve never before had a president with so many financial interests in so many countries. On top of that, we’ll soon have a president who wants to have his family run those interests while simultaneously appearing to advise him on his presidency. Already, Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s president was dissected not just for its geopolitical dominoes, but for its effect on his bottom line: Trump apparently considered hotel investments in Taiwan earlier this year. And Ivanka Trump’s decision to hold a meeting on climate change with Al Gore (a meeting Trump participated in) raised eyebrows, given that she’s supposed to be handling her father’s financial interests as well. Ryan is allowed to have different opinions on different politicians’ potential conflicts of interest; that’s politics. But brushing off Trump’s may not be an option for Ryan for much longer, especially given the moral high ground he took when the tables were turned."
217707,Hillary Clinton and President Obama are increasingly blaming Russia for her loss,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,M,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161217000254/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/16/hillary-clinton-and-president-obama-are-increasingly-pointing-to-russia-to-help-explain-her-loss/,"Hillary Clinton, in audio just unearthed by the New York Times, offers her most unvarnished accounting of her 2016 election defeat yet. And while it’s no surprise that she blames FBI Director James B. Comey  —   she’s done that before, if a bit less forcefully  —   she also points pretty squarely at another “unprecedented,”   actor: Russia. Here’s a partial transcript of Clinton’s comments to campaign donors Thursday night: There were some unprecedented factors that I don’t think we can ignore, because to do so is at our peril. Now, don’t take it from me. Take it from independent analysts. Take it from the Trump campaign. Take it from Nate Silver, who’s pointed out that   voters made their decisions in the final days, breaking against me, because of the FBI letter from Director Comey. And Nate Silver believes  —   I happen to believe this  —   that that letter most likely made the difference in the outcome. But we’re also learning something more every day about the unprecedented Russian plot to swing this election. And this is something every American should be worried about. You know, we have to recognize that, as the latest reports made clear, Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyber attacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me. Clinton later added, in reference to Russia’s meddling, that “the press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign. ” Clinton doesn’t directly say “I lost because of Russia”  —   at least not as directly as she says it about Comey  —   but it wasn’t as if she brought it up simply to make a case about cybersecurity; she brought it up in the context of the “unprecedented factors” that led to her loss. Right after she points to late deciders voting against her because of Comey, she brings up Russia. And Clinton isn’t the only one entertaining the idea that Russia made the difference. President Obama said in a new NPR interview that Russia’s meddling changed the “atmosphere” of the race and dominated the news coverage in a way that crowded out other issues and advantaged Trump in a clear way. Obama told Steve Inskeep: That whole swirl that ended up dominating the news meant that number one, issues weren’t talked about a lot in the coverage, huge policy differences were not debated and vetted. It also meant that what I think would have been a big advantage for Hillary objectively, her experience, her  —   her knowledge, her outstanding reputation around the world as secretary of State, all that stuff got lost. And I think in that scrum, in that swirl, you know, Donald Trump and his celebrity and his ability to garner attention and obviously tap into a lot of the anxiety and fears that some voters have I think definitely made a difference. But did it actually make a difference? Obama then put on his political   cap and left it open as a possibility. “Elections can always turn out differently,” he said. “You never know which factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact, just based on the coverage. ” Obama was very diplomatic about this, but he’s clearly not disputing the idea that Russia may have changed the results of the 2016 election; that’s the inescapable extension of his comments. He was asked a direct question about whether it “could have turned out differently,” and Obama’s answer was decidedly far from “no. ” And in fact, Obama seems to think Russian meddling mattered in a very big way by essentially turning the entire debate away from Clinton’s strengths. Obama emphasized during the same interview that he didn’t want to start “ ” the 2016 election, but the problem with looking at Russia’s role is that this is inherently part of the process. The fact is that Trump’s margin of victory was so small  —   less than 1 percentage point in the three states that mattered: Michigan (0. 2 percent) Pennsylvania (0. 7) and Wisconsin (0. 8)  —   that even a small shift could have made the difference. If Russia’s meddling moved the vote in every state just one point toward Trump, it made the difference. This is a big reason Republicans have been reluctant to go down this road. Even those who may be legitimately worried about Russia’s meddling know it’s not hard to draw the line from A to B to C: The Russians meddled on Trump’s behalf, and Trump won by a very small margin (about 80, 000 votes) so it’s quite possible Russia tipped the scales in the election. The comments from Clinton and Obama aren’t likely to make them feel better about entertaining this investigation and all the questions that come with it. If the conclusion of that investigation is that Russia penetrated deeply and was able to influence the process in a serious way, there will always be that doubt about whether it made the difference and whether Trump would have been president without it. We may never know for sure, but as Clinton and Obama demonstrate, plenty of people will have their suspicions."
217739,"In the Chappaqua woods, a search for Hillary Clinton",Washington Post,Stephanie McCrummen,F,2016-12-17,2016.0,12.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-the-chappaqua-woods-a-search-for-hillary-clinton/2016/12/17/60daea40-c3c0-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html,"CHAPPAQUA, N. Y.  —   The other day, Carol Meyer and her friend Ellen went walking in the woods of Chappaqua. For all they knew, they might see a coyote or some rare mushrooms or Hillary Clinton. “I just have a sense  —   ” said Ellen, putting on her gloves. “You think so?” said Carol, adjusting her scarf. A Clinton sighting was hardly unlikely. She and her husband were Chappaqua neighbors who enjoyed an invigorating,   tromp in the local nature preserve as much as anyone else. And now, of course, she was back in town. Ellen had already seen her in the woods twice since she lost the presidency, and she wasn’t the only one. Two days after the election, a young woman had spotted Clinton and taken a photo with her that went viral, leading to fake news stories alleging that the whole thing was staged, which was said to prove once again that Hillary Clinton couldn’t do anything that did not strike a false note. But Chappaquaians knew better. “Of Course Hillary Clinton Was Hiking The Day After She Lost the Election You        ” wrote one Chappaqua native blogging in defense of the young woman in the photo, who had received hate mail afterward, which was why Ellen and others did not want their full names made public. “It’s not uncommon to run into the Clintons in the nature preserves, or even on the road. ” In fact, photos had been popping up all over in recent weeks showing a   Clinton smiling with strangers in the pines, so many that “Saturday Night Live” did a skit called “The Hunt for Hil,” in which two investigators head off into the woods to “find her, trap her, and thank her” with the help of a forest shaman. Others scrutinizing the photos noted that in one, Clinton appeared to be wearing the same   Patagonia fleece she had been photographed wearing in outings for 20 years, spawning jokes that her fleece had more experience than Donald Trump, and comments about how regular she seemed, how human. It was like Al Gore growing a beard after his 2000 election loss. Or George W. Bush painting   after leaving office. It was Hillary Clinton in the woods: not a candidate running, but a person walking, and probably also talking, as Ellen and Carol were doing now, two lawyers heading along a grassy path into the   preserve. “I read this article by Michael Kinsley  —   he was saying Donald Trump is a fascist, but not in the usual sense,” Ellen began, and as they walked along, the words “corporate statism” and “Tillerson” and “democracy” drifted up into the maples and pines. They huffed up a rocky hill and walked along a ridge. They eased down into a clearing by a   stream, which was where, two days after the election, Ellen had been walking her yellow lab Phoebe, distraught over the results and saying to herself, “If I see her, I see her” when she actually saw her, in the woods: Hillary Clinton coming around a bend. “Bill was in front,” Ellen said. “And then here came Hillary with her poodle and then the agents. And I’m here, and then we were together, and I just said, ‘What happened?’ And she said, ‘I don’t know. I have no idea.’ And I said, ‘I really admire you. You look great. You’re wonderful.’ I stood there with my arms wide open and I’m not even a hugger and I gave her this big hug. She had on a beautiful sweater. She asked my dog’s name. ” A couple weeks later, Ellen, who calls herself “the Sacagawea of the Arboretum,” let Phoebe off her leash. The dog was bounding ahead full speed when she started barking, and then Hillary and Bill Clinton appeared again, this time with their daughter, Chelsea, Chelsea’s husband and their children. It was the day after Thanksgiving and soon, other hikers were popping out of the woods. “I had already hugged her so I just said hello and patted her on the arm,” Ellen said. “Don’t ask me why. ” It was cold and quiet now except for the wind blowing through the bare branches of trees, and the sound of something rustling in the leaves. The women carried on deeper into the woods, bending back twigs, heading up a slope they called “Secret Service Hill” after a time years ago when the path was frozen and they had helped the Clintons’ agents, who were wearing loafers, navigate the incline. The Clintons were well shod. “It was a snowy February day,” Carol recalled. “They were holding hands. ” Ellen remembered Bill talking during his convention speech this summer about how he and Hillary had taken a walk on their first date and had been “walking and talking” ever since. Sometimes, though, it was just Bill walking alone in the woods as Hillary traipsed around the world or campaigned across the country. Once, a Chappaquaian named Judy Fuhrer was driving along the road by the preserve, listening to an audio recording of Bill Clinton’s   memoir. She said she was on the 13th CD when she realized that the tall   man walking his dog up ahead was the former president of the United States. “I stopped and got out of my car and said, ‘I’m listening to your autobiography right now!’ And he said, ‘You listened to the whole thing?! Whoa!’ And I said, ‘I listened to Hillary’s too.’ And he said, ‘Well, that’s more interesting.’ He asked me if I wanted him to sign [the CD] but I told him it was a library copy. ” Once, a Chappaquaian named Lew was coming out of the woods with his dog Maggie when he saw Bill Clinton and the dog heading in. “He said, ‘What’s it like in there today?’ ” Lew recalled. “I said, ‘It’s actually pretty muddy.’ He was complaining he didn’t have on the right boots. ” It seemed like almost every Chappaquaian had some story about the time they ran into the former most powerful man in the world. They had chatted with him in the woods about Nelson Mandela’s birthday party, or at Le Jardin Du Roi bistro about the lost chance for a Middle East peace deal. When Judy Fuhrer’s son broke his arm, Clinton signed the boy’s cast. Ellen ran into him in the bookstore once and handed him her cellphone to wish her    a happy birthday, and he had seemed glad to oblige. Hillary Clinton sightings were less frequent. “Sometimes she was here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, in casual clothes, just like the rest of us,” said Carol, stepping over some rocks. “She’d always comment on it being a nice day, I think so you’d feel comfortable because sometimes it can be intimidating, you know, meeting a former president and, at that time, a secretary of state. ” Now it was different. Now it seemed like Hillary Clinton might appear at any moment, like she was just up ahead, just beyond those trees. Recently, a Chappaquaian named Andy and his two dogs, Lucas and Earl, were out walking and noticed that the leaves normally covering the path appeared to have been cleared by a leaf blower, the first time he had ever seen such a thing. In the distance, he saw two men sitting too stiffly on a bench. “I said, ‘This is odd.’ It’s more like ‘Deliverance,’ ” he said, referring to the movie. “I tried to hustle up with the boys, and that night, my wife showed me the picture. ” A picture of Hillary Clinton in the woods. He had just missed her. “I’d be interested to see her and chat,” he said, figuring it would happen sooner or later, which was what Carol and Ellen figured too. They ducked under the limbs of two skinny trees that arched over the path, and after a while, there was a rustling noise, and the sound of people talking in the distance. It was a Saturday afternoon; Ellen had almost always seen her in the afternoon. She had seen Bill at the Starbucks earlier. Maybe she was back. They pressed on, but soon the sounds vanished, and there was just the woods. “The Cathedral of Firs,” Ellen said, reaching her favorite part of the hike, a swath of evergreens. They stopped and looked around. You could hear a bird or two. You could hear the creak of branches in the wind. They tried to imagine what Hillary would be doing next. “I think of her as someone who wants to be out doing things, having a goal,” Carol said. “My niece wants me to invite her to join my book club,” Ellen said, and as they headed into a clearing, the two friends talked about how they had solved all the world’s problems in the woods, even if they had yet to solve their own grief over the election. Seeing Hillary Clinton out here in nature helped, even if it was also unsettling. “It kind of brings it all home  —   like, oh. Wait. That’s who lost,” Carol said, and soon, they reached the last part of their hike, a path winding through a marshy area of low shrubs with long yellowy leaves. The leaves looked like uncombed yellowy hair. That was what they saw now, not Hillary."
217876,The photos you haven’t seen of Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail,Washington Post,Melina Mara,F,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-sight/wp/2016/12/22/the-photos-you-havent-seen-of-hillary-clinton-on-the-campaign-trail/,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton talks with diners at a popular breakfast spot in Manchester, N. H. on Feb. 6. (Melina   Washington Post)  “If your picture [story] isn’t powerful enough, you aren’t close enough,” said photojournalist Robert Capa. Behind every manufactured scene, there are truthful moments. My job, as a photojournalist covering politics, is to find them. I build a visual narrative within the highly orchestrated landscape created by campaign staffers, but I also work to get access to my subject away from the other cameras, the stage, the crowd. I am looking for the contemplative moment backstage, the concerned whisper between candidate and staff, any moment of serendipity or silliness and stamina. That is how I try to peel away a politician’s facade, frame by frame, day by day. Successful visual storytelling begins with access. My writing colleagues also want access to the primary players, of course, but they can and do report great stories without it, by interviewing other sources. Without access, I’ve got nothing. Establishing that ability to get close requires time, trust, consistency and  . In making a pitch to get access, I always explain that I am trying to create a full portrait over time of the candidate and to tell a complete story of a quest full of ambition, determination and exhaustion. I’ve been covering women striving for political power in America’s boys’ club on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue for decades, and I offered that body of work as my word in building a relationship with Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff over the past two years. I have witnessed women held to higher standards of performance and behavior. Regardless of party, they are required to do their jobs twice as well as male politicians. Their comportment needs to be motherly but not nagging, inspiring but not too emotional. Their physical appearance needs to be perfect. And their skin? Oh, glowing  —   and as thick as rhino hide (as Eleanor Roosevelt would say). In the two years I was on the trail documenting Hillary Clinton’s bid to become the first female president of the United States, I tried each day to resist falling into the visual malaise of documenting the photo op version of a presidential candidate. I reminded myself to always work to reveal the character of the woman and to scrutinize my shoots for any hint of caricature. My instincts always lead me to explore the reasons, emotions and actions  —   Hillary Clinton embracing a moment late in the campaign, refusing to leave a Florida rally in the driving rain so she could meet more voters. Talking to her staff,   and intent, aboard her campaign plane on the day that FBI Director James B. Comey announced that the FBI would reopen its investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server. Throwing her head back and letting out her patented,   laugh while putting on a Halloween mask. Each day, as she negotiated the line of “electability,” struggling to show her humanity without losing her credibility as a candidate, I witnessed Hillary Clinton earning every line on her endlessly expressive face.
